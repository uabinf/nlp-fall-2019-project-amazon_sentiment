"""Hipster,Trendy"" ????-I think NOT !!!! Very disappointing......weird crowd ( older men on the prowl? ) , and unfriendly bartenders w/ lots of attitude. I've given this a few tries thinking I just hit it on a bad night , but won't be going back. So many other great places in Scottsdale to visit !",0
"My husband & I have been going to one Zipp's or another around town for the last 7 years...we currently live near the Old Town location...always our 'go to' place to eat during the week when we don't feel like fixing dinner at home. It's your typical sports bar with a bit better food selection. You can't find a big 32oz beer for $4 ($3.50 @ happy hour) anywhere around town & their onion rings are outstanding, you can order 1/2 & 1/2 ...fries & onion rings with your burger or sandwich. We have never had an issue with the wait staff at any of the 3 different locations we have visited. The new boneless buffalo chicken skewers are fabulous & on special when regular wings are. 
Happy Hour M-F 3-7pm
$5 Wings & other stuff 
Plus nightly specials 8pm-close &
Weekend specials 11a-4p
We love Zipp's!!",1
Perfect place for a hot summer day.  Amazing paletas!  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Welcoming environment in downtown Chandler.,1
"I personally like this Fry's. I think most of the people that work there are extremely friendly. I go there once or twice a week and I'm always greeted with a smile. A few of them even ask me where I've been if I haven't been in for awhile and ask me how I'm doing. Complaing about a grocery store being crowded doesn't make sense to me since that means people like shopping there. They have no control of it being crowded. If you don't like it crowded, go across the street to Safeway where there is no one shopping there. Then you will see a difference of why Fry's is better. Why is it so busy? Because it has better deals and everyone wants to shop there. It's a positive thing. You can either deal with it being crowded once in awhile and save money or go to Safeway across the street where you will be the only shopper and get ripped off. You have options.",1
"Successfully blending the idea of bar food and airline food into one very disappointing meal. A poor choice for breakfast due to mealy/watery eggs, cold potatoes and bland salsa. Even the grapefruit juice lacked flavor.",0
"This place was AMAZING!  I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels, this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to... staff was extremely friendly, I WILL be back!",1
"I have shared many an awful, hungover morning with my favorite stars from the Gay Corridor. The service can be on the scary tweaker side, but it's a good, simple breakfast that doesn't stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness. They've also many different healthy options, not that I've ever done more than glance at those, but it's wonderful nonetheless. It's the crown and glory of Park Central, and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place, as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea.",1
"Nothing spectacular about the food...service was good and the fruity adult beverages/margaritas were tasty. Somehow, between 2 people, we ended up spending close to $50. We thought the waitress was being friendly, but after ordering drinks, it seemed like all she wanted to do was sell us more random crap to get a bigger tip. 
It was a nice change to see hockey on the big screen...",0
"I tried Rare Earth for the first time as a solo diner.  Often a good way to get the take on a new restaurant.  I sat at the bar which has surprisingly uncomfortable seating.  Really hard seats that cut me in the back of the knees.  The wine selection is nice.  Not big but two or three choices of each variety.
I ordered a glass of wine,  a small House salad and a pizza.  
The server behing the bar was ""professionally friendly""  
Then the wait began.  Fifteen minutes passed and I still had no salad.  I was able to get the servers attention and asked about my salad. She didn't check on the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come in around the same time that I did.
Just about 3 minutes later both my salad and my pizza came out at the same time.  Very disappointing.  I wanted to eat my salad but I didn't want my pizza to go cold.  Note: This is extremely thin pizza...like a cracker crust...so it goes cold very quickly.
The server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it, I didn't want the pizza to be ruined.
The house salad was fresh, good mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese.  There were lots of red onions and the dressing, a house vinaigrette was very strong ""and vinegary"". For me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and I would not order that particular salad again.
The pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together pretty well, even considering how thin the crust is. 

I would like to try this restaurant again because there were several things on the menu that sounded really good.

4 stars for the pizza, 2 stars for the salad that I ordered and 3 stars for the service.",0
"Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag.

And this time it was the yeast.

I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up.

Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you're a super star, but I don't work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist. 

But alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for.

Oh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didn't stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower.

Useless motherf*&#$@s!",0
"It is with great regret that I give House of Tricks three stars.

I've been here twice.  The first time, friends invited me and the wifey here for dinner.  Seeing the patio, I thought, ""oh, this is really cute.""  Once seated inside, I thought, ""oh, this is really cute.""  Seeing the prices on the dinner menu, I thought, ""oh, this better be really good.""  Long story short, it was okay.  My friend, who had only been here for lunch, apologized for the unexpectedly high prices.  I didn't care too much, I guess.  It was edible.  I'd probably come back for lunch.

Which I did, with co-workers in tow.  The prices at noon were certainly more agreeable and we all looked forward to a pleasant meal.  Suddenly, this gem of an exchange occurred between our waiter and my boss, Debbi:

Debbi:  How large is the quiche?  I weigh 230 pounds, so I'm a big girl.

We giggled.  Debbi loves to joke.

Waiter:  Well, it's not as big as you.

Bad form, dude.  Bad form.  You're lucky we paid lunch menu prices.",0
"Love their salad bar, so much to eat, not as much as sweet tomatoes but good nevertheless! Only suggestion would b if they can get the labels on foods, bcs for people like me who don't eat meat its very difficult to figure out that there's tuna in one of their salads without a label! I almost ate it, so I hope they take this into account! My best is the whole boiled eggs though :)",1
"Oh.  Mah.  Gawd.

Let me get this out of the way.. the ONLY reason I'm dumping a star on America's Taco Shop is because they charge extra for chips and salsa.  I HATE that.  Charge me if I ask for extra salsa or something, but otherwise, come on.  

Now.  Said chips?  Perfect.  Salsa?  Perfecter.  My taco?  Made me cry a little bit.  I am picky about corn tortillas, but these were brilliant.

Go to America's Taco Shop.  I will see you there.",1
"I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often. 

I LOVE it! 

I've never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section, but who needs to! You can find everything you need right there. 

The meat section is beautiful to look at, they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners, side, soups, sauces etc. grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own! 

My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce, package of fresh pasta, and package of chicken breast strips ..YUM! 
Dinner in 20 anyone? ;-)

Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too!! 

I scored dinner for 3 last night for ......$7!!!! 
2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia, all ready and in about 10 minutes! 

Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good, fresh and easy food then this your place!",1
"In short - Jen rocks!

Finding someone I trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nerve-wracking.  I came across Jen's Pet Sitting while searching for options, since I'm relatively new to the area.  

I decided to book a consultation with Jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services.  Jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters.  It was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them.  

After having a great experience with Jen during the consult I booked her to do visits over a long weekend.  The hubs and I took our dogs along for the trip and Jen looked after our cats while we were away. She gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone.  Sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus!  Jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous.

I always know I've found a wonderful petsitter when I come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me!  We will definitely continue to use Jen in the future.",1
"Does anyone know why their regular subs are $1 more than all the other Jimmy John's? Or is that just when it's delivered, instead of charging a standard delivery fee? I've noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too, and extras...the slim is $4 instead of $3.25, and extra avo is $1.75 instead of $0.75

That's not going to stop me from ordering though :-) Still love their sandwiches...they make the best veggie sub I've had. They load it up with veggies, whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on. I'd much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy John's :-)",1
"Considering this is the only gym I've ever been in, it's great! They have updated equipment and lots of them. I usually go during one of the busy times and can always get on a machine, or do the things I want to. Plus they have classes which are good. And every time me & my boyfriend walk in & out of the Y, a nice gal at the food counter greets us and says goodbye. We still never order anything, though...

They lose a star though because I HATE WORKING OUT!  Sigh...",1
"Ihappened by during their soft open, and I was very impressed with the food. They have a great selection of meats and they are cooked perfectly. They even give you choices of regular or moist briskit (a little fattier to give it more flavor). They have a good house barbeque sauce.
  The facility is pretty simple - very ""bar"" atmsphere and TVs along the walls. The staff is great, and eager to make sure you enjoy the food. I'll be coming back.",1
"As I write this, I'm waiting for the toilet in the room above me to stop refilling, and the man to the upper left of me to stop his muffled, out of key singing.

That puts me in a weird head space, review wise. While this hotel is only three years old, it sounds like it may as well have been built in the 70's. I hear all the conversations of the folks in the hallway, I hear people walking down the hallway above mine, and for the past two days, the heavy footsteps of the person above me woke me up well before my alarm. 

Normally I'm pretty lenient about things like that but, c'mon. This is a roadside haven meant for business travelers (and tourists too stupid to see that this hotel is near NOTHING you're trying to visit Arizona for) to get some damned shut eye. It's a little tough under the current conditions.

Aside from, you know, sleeping. The rest of this Courtyard is pretty nice. The interior and amenities vastly make up for the absolute desolation outside. It's located off 91st, just north of the 10 freeway. There's a little patch of desert and an ITT Technical Institute across the parking lot that seems too small to handle the amount of folks who need to park.

Anyway, back to the inside. This is a newer Courtyard. Marriott is drastically trying to get its old chains into a modernization fit to compete with Hilton and Hyatt's business lines. This renovation, (or new construction in this case) includes adding a ""restaurant"" for breakfast and dinner. And a bar across the way open from 5pm-10pm. Thank God for these two additions because the pickin's around the hotel are slim as a Calvin Klein model. I think there's a Chipotle around the corner. I didn't see you jump for joy. What, not impressed?

The rooms are the modern Courtyard style with LG flat screens, fancy shampoos, interesting art on the walls, wired and wireless internet...etc. This location has low tile showers with glass doors. Fancy. I'm used to the sliding curtain that ends up soaking the floor because it's all cloth anyway.

If they could get the sound issues fixed (lucky me, I'm on the side of the hotel NOT facing the freeway) I'd easily give another star. Proximity to anything worthwhile is pretty bad, but the point of this hotel appears to be for housing workers in the local warehouses nearby. There's plenty of regulars here week after week after week as the bartender told me a few nights ago.

One definite draw is that their weight room is pretty top notch and, of course, dead. You can easily be the only one in there night after night while folks who really need to use a gym will walk by you with minds set on beers, staring into the window as if to ask why anyone would try to work off the food they eat. Hmmm... I wonder. 

The interior of this Courtyard vastly makes up for the desolation",0
"I been here once and I loved it!!  Food here is amazing! Decor is cute, felt like walking into someones home!  It's communal seating so get to know other guest!  Service was great, but before I continue....They're closing this weekend due to the lack of business!  OMG!  I recommend going before you miss out - take care Lola - what ever you want - you get :)",1
I had a mammogram completed on 12/12/10.  This facility has been covered by my health insurance for over a decade.  But not this time.  The doctor terminated his contract with the insurance provider on 12/01/10.  Screwed for $300.,0
"The Good Egg is a breakfast spot I frequent on a regular basis. During the week it's hopping with folks on their lunch breaks and the weekend crowd seems to be most predominant during brunch hours.

The menu offers a wide variety of items to choose from. They are only open for breakfast and lunch, but you can order any of them at any time during business hours. Pancakes of a mammoth proportion are often seen zooming by on the arm of a server. Instead of hashbrowns, homestyle fried potatoes are served on the side of most dishes.

The serving staff have always been very friendly and accommodating and it makes the experience a very pleasant one every time I am there. The patio is very large and can seat many. This is especially nice during sunny days, but not so much on a cold January morning even with the large heaters operating.

If you go on a weekend morning, prepare for a bit of a wait. You can sip complimentary coffee outside while waiting for your party to be called. It's always fun to give a fake name for your party as it is eventually announced over a very loud loudspeaker for the world to hear.  When you hear Captain Caveman's party being called to go take their seats, keep an eye out for me giggling somewhere nearby.",1
"I've never been to this location before. My husband had taken his car here previously, and asked me to take it in today (there was a nail a front tire). The second I stepped through the doorway I was greeted, even though all agents were busy helping other customers -- excellent customer service to acknowledge I'm there! 

Less than a minute later I had a gentleman walk me out to the car and look at it. He tested to see how far in the nail was, and realized it didn't puncture, so he took it out and said the tire was fine. 

I went there knowing my husband is WAY overdue for new tires, so asked for a quote. He gave me a few options, and told me what driving habits they'd be best for. He also gave me the warranty information without me asking for it, and included it in the price instead of ""shockingly"" adding it in when I would pay like most places would. I never thought for a second that I was being oversold. It was amazing because I despise going anywhere having to do with fixing my car. 

Quick. Clean. Friendly. Intelligent. Honest. That about sums up this place. I'd recommend it to ANYONE and tell you to go out of your way to visit this location.",1
Not a bad theater. The staff is friendly and the sound is ok.,1
I am for out of town and came here to celebrate my Birthday and it was a blast. The food was delicious and our Tepenyaki chef Robert was hilarious and very on point. This place is definitely a must when going to Scottsdale. I do go to Arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon.,1
"Came for a friend's birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. I'd go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldn't suggest making this your regular hang out.",0
"We were staying at a hotel nearby and found the reviews for this spot. Boy are we glad that we did! We are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city, this was definitely one for our list. 
We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best. 
Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Fresca's ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side.",1
"When checking in I was greeted by the General Manager. It was nice talking to you Michael; I hope to see you at the Westin La Paloma. The Sheraton is great for a night stay if you plan on going to the airport. I stayed with my family for one night and caught a shuttle to the airport at 3:30am (Complimentary). Ugh so early, but my driver was very friendly. The night auditor was very helpful and was able to give my family a late check-out till 1:30. SO AWESOME!  I love late check outs, they make your day/morning better. No need to rush. The bathroom is a little small, vanity area is limited but fully stocked and you get a loofa.
My little sister and Mom enjoyed the pool as well. Nice small patio area to enjoy from your room too. If I ever have to fly out of Phoenix or into Phoenix and have to stay over my choice is definitely the Sheraton Phoenix Airport.",0

"Wow, this was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time. I definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that I have an entree that knocks my socks off. For me, this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce. My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I don't like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband's. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didn't like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50. Very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine. 

This place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio. There were two servers and on a busy Fri night, service was slow. But they were very nice and apologetic, so I gave them a break. I noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space. I was very impressed. I cannot WAIT to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing.",1
Amazing tour with a guide that was very knowledgeable and entertaining. The prize of the 90 Minute tour was a bit steep but well worth it after the fact. I will be back for the shelter tour.,1
"My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California. We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip.  My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders. My grandchildren ate the original fries, while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese. The fries were not hot, nor had the cheese melted. I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife. 

I have recommended RnR in the past. I do not think I will in the future.",0
Yay!! This place is fantastic. Great pastries and atmosphere. I can't wait to go back.,1
"Spring Rolls - Great!  Singapore Noodles - Great!  Hot & Sour Soup - not so great - I have never had a hot and sour soup so dark!  Although the hot was hot and the sour, was sour - a little bit goes a very long way!

Definitely going back again, just skipping the hot & sour soup next time.",1
"Most livable city my eye!
Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong.  I can't wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class.

Avoid at all cost.",0
"great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular",1
Similar to Desert Ridge.  All the typical chains are here. I like the Jimmy John's for a quick lunch.,0
"The noise makes it almost impossible to talk. The staff looks like the customers or the customers are better dressed. Staff is wrinkled, sunglasses on the back of their head, it's hard to know who you supposed to ask for help. Once you know, they are responsive, friendly and willing to please.

The food is fair, dressings, sauced are too watered down. The food is minimal in terms of amounts for the money. It is a favorite among the neighborhood but these are now the adults whom hung out at the old Monastery behind Whitney & Murphy funeral home. I am beginning to think my fellow Az peeps have no idea what good casual food is about. The service in AZ is terrible, all of customer service in businesses here is terrible, restaurants and retail.
watch out for the Valets, they drive customers cars too fast around the parking lot, here and Arcadia Tavern!


I am entitle to my opinion since I have worked my way through school as a waitress/bartender , valet service manager and service consultant.

"I brought DD and her friend here today after a long day of Summer Camp and running around.  

We showed up shortly before 3 p.m. for their Pop In Playtime, which is supposed to be from 10 am to 5 pm.  

There are two rooms of bouncy house contraptions that are appropriate for children older than age 3.  I don't know if they have actual age or size restrictions, but kids younger (and/or small kids) would have a difficult time here.  One reason it would be hard for younger kids?  There are specific instructions for the contraptions which they go over with the kids before they are allowed inside.  Some have a max of 2 kids at a time (the obstacle courses), some have a max of 6.  One has a max of four, with three on the ladder and one going down the slide.  Younger kids would likely need to be constantly reminded of the rules, as they can be a little rigid.

Both my 4 year old and the 9 year old LOVED it here.  They both said they preferred it to Jumpstreet.  

The girls were bummed out when at ten minutes to 4 someone came in and said playtime would be ending in ten minutes.  Then the guy said if parents wanted to know why, we could approach him.  Upon approaching him, he said that two birthday parties were booked for 4 p.m., so they were ending Pop In Playtime early.  

Some parents were VERY upset, having just gotten there less than 30 minutes prior.  DD was very disappointed.  It took a little prodding to get her to put her shoes back on and get ready to leave after only an hour of playing.  

On the way out, some parents stopped by and talked to the shift manager.  She just handed out cards for another session since ours was cut short.  Pretty cool; we will use the cards to bring another neighborhood kid back with us.

There were JUST the right amount of kids here at this time of the day.  I cannot imagine how nuts it must be here on a weekend or during Summer mornings.  

Still, bring a book and some bottled water and sit on the sidelines... or do as I did and run the obstacle course several times on the insistence of the kids.  ;)  It was fun!",1
"More expensive than some of the other nearby locations ($5 military lot next door) The shuttle was nice and quick shuttle despite odd hours of the night. Nice enough, they also accepted competitor coupons when the lot with the deal was full. The boyfriend and I had a great experience and prompt service at all hours of the night. It also seems more secure. Loved it!",1
Ok..seriously just ok. Green salsa was horribly sweet and gel like. It had no taste of tomatillo in it. The tacos were stuffed to the gills but average. The chimis tasted reheated in the microwave and oddly like sopapillas. Over all ok food but a bit pricy for ok food.,0
"This place is busy, had live music in the bar, and the servers were trying to squeeze by.  The seafood is flown in DAILY and I think our bill helped fund a grouper or two's first class seat.  I ordered the grouper with crab on top (as an extra- you can ask for it this way).  Ordered the lobster mashed again, and green beans (if it ain't broke- don't order something else.).  Had a great night!",1
"A very reliable local garage. Bill is all about great customer service, and goes the extra mile. He deflated my fears about ""being taken"" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance. He's a truly good guy, knows his stuff, and will work to save me money if he can find it. I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks, and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop.",1
"PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine. The portions are HUGE! My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it, and still always have leftovers. The menu prices are very reasonable. Including tip, we usually don't spend more than $15 for the both of us for dinner. They are very personable and attentive to your needs. I love that it is a very dainty, and has a very laid back atmosphere. The lemon chicken is our favorite!! :) They are also very kid friendly. We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol, but they love him! Highly recommend!",1
"I came here for the first time on a rainy Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a great friend I hadn't seen in 6 months.  Our server who was cute as a button picked up our ""we are not in a hurry vibe"" right away.  We ordered a bottle of wine, fairly priced and loved the added touch of a chilled wine glass.  Our food was very good but no real risk was taken. We shared the fish and shrimp tacos which were flavorful but I had to add some hot sauce to give it a little bite.  The beans and white rice were a simple filler, nothing more.  The menu looked interesting and the prices were fair so I would definately try it again.
There were only 2 things that I found disapointing, first was after we ate I ordered a martini, one from their menu, it was fruity and you couldn't taste the alcohol at all.  The problem was it was served in a very small martini glass and I feel when you are going to make a fruity concoction and call in a martini the glass should be bigger, not the James Bond shaken not stirred size.
Second problem, as we were eating a woman came and sat at the table right by the restrooms and plugged her computer into an outlet that made the cord block the restroom door.  Now my companion and I couldn't decide if she worked there or not, she never ordered food and wasn't there long.  But just the fact that the cord blocked the door and could have been hazardous really bothered me.
Overall though I give the place a B+",1
"Yes, I'm a fan this place but it definitely does not deserve a 5 star rating.  First off lets start with the decor.  While it was very nice when it first opened it's now getting a little raggedy looking and could use some updating.  Food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit.   If I could give them some advice it would be to get rid of  the HUGE salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections.  I've been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section.  So why spend so much money to have such a huge selection???   Put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value.  And for Gods sake bring back the Mayonnaise Shrimp !!  You made one of the best versions I've ever tasted.",1

"Recently, I found myself in downtown Mesa looking for a place to sit an write a while while my son went to a concert - I had 4-5 hours to kill. I planned visiting one of the coffee houses within a 5 mile radius but my lack of familiarity with Mesa made that a disagreeable prospect. Fortunately, I noticed Lo-Fi Coffee, which was literally part of the concert venue building, before I began my trek. Lo-Fi was a comfortable place that served good coffee. But what made me a fan of Lo-Fi was the barista, an Air force vet who was friendly and went out of his way to make me comfortable (they closed at 9 and he let me sit in  until 9:30 - concert lasted until midnight). If I lived closer, or if Lo-Fi opened shop nearer where i live, I would go back again.",1
"2nd time I went to Grazie and both times it was excellent. The service is fast and attentive and the food great. The portions are huge so there is no problem to share the starter or the thin crust, wood-fired pizza ... So far I had the Dame Edna and the Roma pizza and both were very tasty. The wine collection is great and has some very interesting stuff which includes also less expensive wines. Haven't made it to the desert menu yet as both times there was no space left ...",1
"4 stars based on the sangria alone.

Order this motherfucker by the PITCHER, without apology.

If you can sit out on the patio, so much the better. if not, grab a comfortable booth near the bar.",1
"I can't comment on the donuts (which is pretty ridiculous seeing as that's the main draw here), but I was satisfied with the boba smoothies. They're definitely not anywhere close to being great, but for someone who's not picky about boba, they're really refreshing. The boba itself was kind of mediocre, but it had a good flavour and wasn't too sweet. I got a taro smoothie and a honeydew smoothie. 
The honeydew tasted surprisingly good for being from a powdered mix, it was just like drinking a fresh honeydew melon. The taro was even better, although the drinks were a bit too icy for me. They were a lot better after I let the ice melt a bit, but who wants to wait?",0
"I can only give this place an OK because that's just what I have had from them so far- food that was ok, not slap your grandma good! The menu is kind of hard to understand but I know that I like chicken pho so I ordered that the first go-round and just wasn't wowed like I wanted to be. The noodles were good but the broth just wasnt to my liking. The second time I had pork noodles (dry) and it was better but still not GOOD. JD had the spicy noodle soup and that was good too, but , again, you guessed it-OK. I haven't given up on it yet because it is so close to my house and the people are so nice and friendly.  Any suggestions on what to order won't be ignored.",0
"I like frozen stuff. Ice cream, frozen bananas, mountaintop snow, icebergs, glaciers, frozen caveman lawyers - all good.

A friend introduced me to Golden Spoon this afternoon. What a great treat! They have convenient little portions for the sensible and great big portions for the more gluttonous. It tastes great, costs little, and really hits the spot.",0
"As you may have read in a previous review, so graciously provided by Dally, that Four Peaks is our post-Tuesday night hockey watering hole. We normally show up stinky and limping or in some sour mood or another. Somehow we always leave a little happier, but still limping, well I do anyway. 

Unfailingly, we are greeted by the bouncer, who no longer cares to see our ID's, either because he can see the age in our strides or because he knows us now. I would like to believe the latter. Also, waiting for us is the lovely and nicht so talented Karina. Bless her poor soul for putting up with our asinine questions about her life and our requests for more water. She humors us anyway. 

We are made to feel like this place is home, at least for a couple of hours on a Tuesday night. Karina knows what we order for drinks and never has to ask, just brings. I usually switch between a simple salad with a great balsamic vinaigrette or a plate of fries. I know, diametrically opposed. Just depends on the mood and how committed I am that day/week to my diet. I always get the 8th St Ale though. It is very good and for 3 bucks can't be beat. 

I have enjoyed the pretzels, the now ""famous"" nachos, with chicken mind you, the spinach-artichoke dip, some of the various wing flavors, and a pizza. For late night dining they are all very palatable.  I have a funny wing story, but I think it is only funny to me, Dallas, Z, and our friend Peter.  If we ever get the elusive Z to join, I will make sure he shares his story on here.

Until then, check out Four Peaks in Scottsdale.  The late night menu satisfies and is not hard on the wallet.  Tell Karina Brad sent you.  You won't get a discount, maybe just a laugh.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by Sauce. We went here for dinner last night, and wanted something quick, tasty and casual. Done. I think of it as a cross between a fast food place and a pizzeria.

I had the Pepperoni and Crimini Mushroom pizza, and it was great. The crust is amazingly thin yet perfect for the pie. The center where the toppings are is a nice and soft but the edges are super crispy with a chip-like ""crunch"". The sauce and toppings were noticeably fresh and perfectly proportioned on the pizza.

M had the Turkey salad, and she too was very pleased. I can describe hers much - as we both stuck to our plates!

The waitstaff was very pleasant and everything came out well; however nothing really blew me away to earn that 5th star.",1
"Being a native Californian-I never knew these existed till I drove from Los Angeles to Charlotte, NC in 2005 and realized they are everywhere!!! I kept seeing these bill boards every few miles and finally decided that I had to try one. Fearing it was something like a ""Waffle House"" which I'd had the misfortune to visit once at 3am, I was prepared to turn and walk out if it was disgusting. My first experience was a pleasant surprise and this location is pretty much the same, in fact, every location is the same, which is a good thing when 
you are on a road  trip and looking for a clean bathroom and somewhere to grab a bite, maybe get some entertainment for the road.

The front entrance is lined with rocking chairs and this location has water misters out there, which is good because the only place I have been that is hotter than Buckeye is Needles, Ca and i think Needles, Ca is right underneath a hole in the Ozone!

Anyway, inside they have a little country store with every kind of candy you can imagine and seasonal cute stuff along with books, toys, gifts and such. The bathrooms are usually way cleaner than you'd find at a truck stop, rest stop or gas station and they have a full service restaurant with a ""down home"" menu. 

Best thing is breakfast all day long and they make great breakfast! 

If you are on the road and looking for a clean, pleasant pit stop. This is a great place to spend some time and re-charge for the road.",1
"Papago Park is a great place to ride (bicycles, that is).  The terrain can be as easy or as hard as you'd like-- just choose your trail!",1
Completely shady.  Towed our U-haul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex.  Completely unethical and total crooks.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,0
"I hate to find out that there was another location closer to where I was.  It doesn't matter because it was worth the trip.  I ordered pick up because I was by myself and wanted to a bit of exploring.  The place has a nice casual ambiance.  They also have an outdoor seating area.  I ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard.  Since it was lunch time, it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the soup, but was too stuffed to have it because I jumped right into the pad thai.  I ordered it medium spicy, and it was pretty spicy.  I can't imagine what hot would have tasted like.  Actually, I'm more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor.  The noodles were slightly overcooked, but still flavorful.  I also had the Thai Iced Tea here, and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor.  The prices are expensive compared to Chicago, but I hear it's typical for Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  My lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over $15.  I guess if you are craving it that bad like I was, you'll pay the price...",1
We've eaten here a number of times and have always had the best service and great food.  All of the servers we've had were excellent and the manager always makes it a point to check on us and see if we need anything.  No complaints and we'll definitely be eating there again.,1
"I love this place! Great flavors, love the tiny gummy bear toppings.

One thing I don't like is the inconsistent hours. One day they'll be open at 8, the next time they close at 7:30. When our yogurt craving hits, we'd love to patronize Woody's, but never know if they're going to be open.

I tried over and over to call one night, and the phone was just constantly busy. A little frustrating!

I do enjoy their yogurt, but with the weird hours, and so-so feel from the staff it's hard to give them more than 3 stars.",0
"Not the best burger I've ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McD's, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But it's more of an attraction than anything else.",0
"I love going to this store whether its for just for the latest copy of guitar world, some strings, or a new guitar, the guy johnny is my main man lol he always gives me good deals and generally makes me and any one else i take there feel like we are the only customers, (in a good way!) every one remembers you and asks you how your day is going great ""mom and pop"" feel.",1
"This place was AWESOME!!!  My wife and I have been driving by this location for a couple years and finally decided to go in, I had a yearning for Ramen.  It did not disappoint.  We got there just before happy hour, which is always a bonus, but would still go outside of happy hour.  The menu is quite extensive, the bonus is they have Italian noodle dishes as well.  We have been told that this is authentic to Japan so I was impressed to see this in the valley, having been to many ""Japanese"" restaurants.

We decided to try many different dishes, and were equally impressed with all.  I had the TanTan-Men, a spicy Ramen with pork, delicious.  We shared some tuna sashimi, which was fresh and tasty (looked like real pink, no added color).  We also shared the Seafood Delight roll, which has tuna, 'krab' and is topped with a scallop, fantastic.  The last thing we ordered were the Spicy Korean Ribs, this was my least favorite, but still good.  Of course the Kirin (on draft) was flowing as well as the house Saki.

Overall the CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe impressed us to say the least.  We will be back to try more.  Thank you CherryBlossom, keep up the Great Work.",1
"We've been going to Santisi for close to 10 years since they are just around the corner from my house. We've never had a bad item here. It's a fun place to go and the food is great. We always order pizza which is consistently good. Their salads are excellent - all their ingredients are very fresh and there's enough for two meals if you're a lighter eater. And the wings are always excellent. 

We've always had good service and the staff keeps the beverages coming. It's a great place to watch a game - if you can get in! Friday and Saturday nights are so crowded we often grab a beer while we wait for our take-out pizza. The parking can be a challenge since the stripes are laid out weird and there's a dollar theater next door. You can park in back (the side toward the freeway) if there's no room in the front.

We moved away in 2006 and came back in 2010 and Santisi was still there, and as good as ever.",1
"So great to see the occasional NY style pizzeria pop up amid all these chi-town ""pizza"" impersonators... Sorry, but if you think pizza is cut in squares, or it's crust should taste like a stale saltine cracker, perhaps this isn't for you.

A great street style joint with friendly staff and always a great selection ready to go, and conveniently located right next to AMC 24. Bring a messenger bag or purse and get some Vincents to go, and avoid the concession stand. Just sayin...",1
"I'm convinced that anyone giving this airline more than one star is most likely associated with them and is concerned about their job.  I've been flying with them for 7 years back to NC to see my aging mother.  I fly 3X/year on the same flights.  The service and attitude of the employees has been getting progressively worse.  I am also a pilot (20) years and I understand the weather and air traffic control VERY well!  This rant is not about operations, security or delays.  It is about the customer service by pissed off employees.  My wife said that if she was not with me on my last trip she would not have believed what happened.  I forgot to purchase my own bottle of water before getting on the plane in Charlotte.  The beverage service was 2 hours into the flight!  This old, cranky b#$%^ came by and said, ""what do you want?""  I said I would like to have a soda and a water.  She said you can only have one or the other.  I was so thirsty I asked for the water.  It was a very small glass that I drank very fast and then ask for a refill...please!  She said, ""I told you that you could only have one""  and pushed the cart away.  Even the people around me were in shock.  The check in personal were equally as rude.  If you are watching the internet news, there was an article a few weeks back that rated customer satisfaction and US Airways was at the bottom!  I for one will never fly with them again.",0
"Worth the trip but be willing to deal with some craziness. There was a mob waiting outside before the doors even opened.

1 pair of dressy sandals
2 pairs of ankle boots
1 pair of pumps
2 dresses
3 pairs of name brand nylons

=$215

So I got a deal. Was is the best deal ever? Probably not, but it was definitely worth the trip. 

Pros: Unlike other thrift/bargain stores everything is stored by size and type of item. 

Cons: The psycho shopper club that meets 30 mins prior to store opening!",0
"I recommend this to everyone.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place.",1
"Earl's is Earl's - not great - not bad. If you're in the neighborhood and don't have anywhere else to go, go to Earl's. By far there are better choices, but Earl's will do when you're in a pinch.

Typical bar food with no particular edge to make it memorable. 

The staff is very friendly and the service is very good. 

Just average, not memorable.",0
Our server Gary was awesome. Food was amazing...an experience.,1
"I come here about 4 or 5 times a year. It's consistently good. There is ample seating, so I've never waited long. It's off Central, so the parking is horrid. Their lot holds a good number, but it can be tricky to get in and out when crowded - I don't drive my van here.
  I am always pleased with the food. I find the salads ok - I really like their Balsalmic Vinigarette dressing - I'll mop the leftover with bread.
 I typically get spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage. The sauce has a good flavor.
 The Brown Butter with Mizithra Cheese is incredible - but very rich.
  The staff is always courteous, and I rarely have to wait for anything.",1
"I was very impressed and surprised by the quality of this restaurant!  This place is STYLISH - whether it's the plush lounge chairs on the patio, or the old school movies being projected on the walls - there's definitely an element of class that is rare for the Mill Avenue district.

First impressions were extremely positive - the place was busy but not packed, candlelit tables, and dim lighting provides the perfect atmosphere for a date, but not too much so that it causes that uncomfortable, formal, anxiety feeling.  La Bocca almost seems like an AZ88 in Tempe for those who are fans.  

I was pleasantly surprised at the prices on the menu.  Most items were in the $10-15 range, and I was immediately intrigued by the various pizza selections.  I focused my sights on the garden pizza, which took me by surprise because it was basically a chef-tossed salad on a really good pizza crust.  My girlfriend went with the bruschetta planks and chose two homemade pesto, one mozarella basil, and one roasted artichoke - DELICIOUS!

Top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and you've got a really good meal for right around the $40-50 mark.  Needless to say we will be returning!",1
"Saketini opened not too long ago, so they're still having grand opening specials.  Get 'em while they're hot!

I haven't had their food yet, but I have partaked in their fantastic drink specials.  They have $2 well drinks for happy hour.  Woo hoo! Plus they have a reverse happy hour too, which scores them another star.  Any place that offers late night drink and food specials is alright in my book.  Once I try the food, I'll be back and I'll update the review.",1
"My home airport, so with work travel, I'm passing through here very often. I prefer Terminal 4 because of the variety of eating/drinking options for pre-flight enjoyment, and 2 and 3 are just OK and don't offer so much in amenities... but they're less crowded and that is a nice plus.  Also, free wifi!

I rarely get lost in here and to be honest, security here has never been an issue... lines have been long going to gates in Term 4 but they move fairly quickly.

I don't do body-scans (my personal choice), so if you choose to do the same, when you put your crap in the conveyor belt and you note they are only doing body scanners, alert the TSA person and let them know you'll need a pat-down (or a groping.. feel-up.... whatever you wanna call it ;)).  Electing to do this takes me longer to get through security, but I prefer it and plan ahead.

Also, if you have a digital boarding pass on your iPhone or Android and go through a *different* gate (they are mostly all connected via runways, etc) due to the line at the gate you're supposed to go through, note that they may not be able to scan your digital boarding pass... this happened to us once when we went to another gate with a significantly shorter line.. luckily they had the kiosk just there so I ran out of line and printed them out while hubby held my spot.  FYI!!",1
"Top notch. He is now my go to barber. Charged only $16 for cut and beard trim, but I throw him a tip on top of that for an exceptional cut. He will ask you questions throughout the cut to make sure you end up with the cut you came for. Can't go wrong with this guy. And what a cool place!",1
"Still solid, still delicious. I love this place!",1
"White tank is still an excellent place to hike. I hadn't been here in about 8 years. I was really shocked to see all the new construction near the entrance. A shame really. 

The flowers were in bloom, so that was a bonus for sure.",1
"Let's start by disclosing that I grew up in New Orleans, went to school in Lafayette (home of the Ragin Cajuns), and REALLY know good New Orleans/cajun food. I grew up eating great po-boys, gumbo, red beans, and wouldn't consider eating any of these if not well prepared. That said, I can truly say that Jennifer and the Flavors of Louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any you'll find in New Orleans--SERIOUSLY. The po-boys are spot on (though the bread could be a little crustier) and the chicken & andouille gumbo is even better than mine--and, I assure you, that's DAMN GOOD. Frankly, I've never had better. The only thing that is not ""as good as it gets"" is the red beans and rice. They're good, but not quite the creamy ""Washday Monday"" staple that I grew up on. My cajun grandmother has Jennifer beat on that one, but not by much. 

But, if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all, get a sausage po-boy. Hot sausage or smoked sausage po-boys are a New Orleans staple and my favorite po-boys of all. But, Jennifer blows them all away with her home-made andouille. Simply put, I've never had better sausage--ever. It's the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her po-boy the best ever.

I've eaten at Flavors many times, even though I live across town. Every time I go, I eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later. I have no affiliation with the restaurant, but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows New Orleans food and as a thank you to Jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the World (not just Louisiana). As a matter of fact, I even overlook the fact that Jennifer is from Baton Rouge, instead of New Orleans or Lafayette and for not having any USL/UL Lafayette paraphernalia on the LSU/Saints wall. At least that is, so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of town--that is, a lot closer to where I live.

If you want the ONLY good cajun food in Phoenix, treat yourself to Flavors of Louisiana. For me, it's just like a visit to any of my favorite po-boy shops in the old neighborhoods. It really is that good.",1
"This go around I opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito (served all day!) and lengua (tongue), cabeza (head, and cheek meat), and carnitas (roasted pork) tacos.  

The breakfast burrito was the tastiest, bacon filled treat I have ever had! I love bacon, and if you don't love it as much as I do, the bacon overload may be too much, I swear there might be more bacon than egg in this bacon bomb!

I should have figured that with a price of $2.50 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco.  The size of these things are gAstronomical, and the flavor of each are equally proportional, the lengua, however,  would've probably been better if it hadn't been sitting in the cold whilst I ate the other three items!

I will no longer be eating carne asada at this place when I have the option of carnitas, cabeza, lengua, or bacon.  I advise you to do the same!",1
"Place is tiny and relies mostly on outside seating, and parking is a bit tough like everywhere in that area, but worth it.  The iced tea wasn't good, but the Southwest Chicken Sandwich was delicious...definitely recommended.  

Parking a couple blocks down on Main in the art district was the best we could do after circling around..but the walk isn't bad.",1
"While I like the food here, it seems like the service is just really hit and miss.  Just went a few nights ago, and after waiting 20 minutes for my food, I was informed they were out of what I ordered.  Then, they were out of forks and fortune cookies.  

That being said, when they do have my order, the food is always fresh and flavorful.  The management seems to realize when there are issues, as they have provided free appetizers and such when we were unhappy.  

Overall, a decent place, but might have to start trying other locations.",0
"I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy John's is.  So I went in, and found my new favorite sandwich spot!  The inside was very noisey, but I liked the atmosphere.  The bread had an awesome fresh taste, and when I inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches, the cashier was very helpful.",1
Scuzy waiter. Scuzy manager. Overall just a bad experience. The food was pretty awful too. I don't understand how this place is so successful! The food was either waaaay over-seasoned of severely under-seasoned. A hole in the wall Chinese restaurant can produce better Chinese food. And at cheaper prices. Search around. It'll be well worth it.,0
"Nice , big, clean, and lots to chose from. This place has a very nice SCUBA section, and that is hard to find in  the desert. I purchased a gift card for a friend and that is why I showed up. Lots of good stuff and a wonderful staff. I live by Dicks so that is where I usually go, but if in the neighborhood I would hit them up.",1
"I got a quick to go Asian Salad.  Read the ingredients, no bell peppers (i'm allergic.)  Awesome.  Run like Oj to terminal B to catch my connecting and sit down to eat.  There were at least 15 slices of red bell pepper that i had to pick out.  This usually does the trick.  I guess since it was packaged, it tainted the rest of the salad.  Yep.  Instant allergic reaction.  Would not have wanted to sit next to me on the plane.

It was tasty fresh and fast.  Please check your labels, Blanco.  Spare me and others that might be allergic to unlisted ingredients.",0
"Went here tonight with a friend and we had a wonderful experience! We decided to start with the calamari which was just ok but I am more partial to the fried versions so that could have been part of the problem it was a little on the rubbery side and wasn't packed full of flavor. The bread that came with it though was absolutely amazing, hands down one of the best breads I have ever had. It also had a mini salad with it that had a wonderful dressing so we focused more on the bread and salad as opposed to the calamari. For dinner I decided to go with the lamb and potatoes which was 3.5/5 stars. It had decent flavor but I definitely have had better. The potatoes were very delicious though :) My friend had the duck and potatoes and it wasn't gamey and fell right off the bone which was great. It had good flavor but once again I have had better. For desert I got the pear/almond pastry(tart? can't remember) and it was absolutely amazing!! Soooo delicious and had a great balance of sweetness and was the perfect size. My friend got the blueberry and lavender desert with red cake and white chocolate which was very good as well and you could taste the lavender which was delicious but overall I don't think I would have been able to eat the entire thing myself as the sweetness level was very high.

This was a very cute restaurant and the staff was wonderful and very helpful. We had a great experience here and are looking forward to returning! I definitely recommend people try this!",1
"Went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it. I think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there.

The service was ridiculous. If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food... at LEAST make sure the menus you hand people are clean. Or your plates for that matter. Or silverware. Seriously! Did EVERYTHING have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance?

Next up... the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal?

I ordered the Coconut Curry Vegetables. Bland bland bland. I've had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen. And would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate?

I guess I just don't understand the hype. The prices are ridiculous for the quality received. You're better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers.",0
"Was at Zinc again last night and have to say the place keeps getting better still.  Started with the crepes again, perfect again.  Then shared the scallops and lamb shank for dinner.  I'm not usually a huge fan of lamb OR scallops but they were recommended and I was feeling adventurous.  The lamb -  AMAZING.  Melt in your mouth wonderful.  More like a stew than anything with classic fall off the bone tender meat over creamy cheesy polenta.  Their bread is perfect French bread too.  This time of year (winter) there is a festive, buzzy energy with a good crowd but not TOO long of a wait.  Make reservations though for sure.  Oh, and Bobby's across the way in Kierland is a nice spot for a pre-dinner drink (400s Hollywood glamour meets The Jetsons with cool live jazz your parents or grandparents would have enjoyed back in the day).",1
"Simply magnificent. Easily the best Mexican food I've had the pleasure of enjoying in the States. I can't stop thinking about the carne asada Torta. The rice and beans are the best I've eaten. Tacos are simple and delicious. The most exciting part about it is that I get to go back and try the famed Bombero Burrito and other, more ""exotic"" things like the lengua and menudo!

You must go!",1
"I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers, and had to leave with one. Luckily, she offers great discounts after her classes!

Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!

Shar has great classes, and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!

So glad I found shar's, now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!",1
"Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).  

One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.  

I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!",0
"""Fuck you all, we hope you die.
That's the Trojan Battle Cry!""
Wow, I can not believe someone Yelp'ed PV. 
 My freshman year, my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned. We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.
  The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. 
Man, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon.
 They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus. 
 They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov't events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it. 
 I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase ""come out of the closet"" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoo's for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie ""Pump Up the Volume"", which was filmed in the general area.
  When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didn't have enough uniforms for the entire team. 
 I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that ""The slaves did not have it so bad"".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. ""If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DON'T.""  
 
The Good Things I Remember -
 Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza. My friends  wearing cut out Trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced ""spirit assemblies"" and chanting our own spirit chant of ""Fuck you all we hope you die, that's the Trojan battle cry"".

 Time has a way of blurring the past, and making it less icky. Yet, my sister is a teacher at North Canyon, and a few years back I went and visited her on campus. The second I stepped into the main building, I felt sick to my stomach. Literally. 
 I hear they have made improvements since I graduated, and I hope so. I don't want my niece and nephew forced to survive another drone factory.",0
"We arrived at US Egg on St. Patrick's Day at 10:00 am before the A's vs. Giants Spring Training game and only had a wait of 15 minutes. Not bad to start! Promptly seated we were brought a pitcher of water and ordered our breakfast. The Denver Scramble is delicious! My husband ordered the Hash & eggs - reasonably priced, quick service and a ton of food to start your long days off right!",1
"After a bad experience at a Thai restaurant, I swore off eating Thai food.  I don't like spicy food and I was thoroughly convinced that all Thai food is spicy (even if you tell them you want it mild).

After talking to a colleague, he told me to try Lemongrass. He spoke so highly of it that I had to give Thai food a another try.  So I did and to my dismay, I loved it.  I checked Yelp before going and everyone recommended the Thai Basil.  That's what I ordered and I loved it.  I also got the Thai Iced Tea and that was yummy in my tummy sweetness.

Lemongrass rocks and I will be back.",1
"Mellow Mushroom - WOW

As you may tell from recent reviews, I have been on a Pizza crusade. Well, I took a friend to Mellow Mushroom today and the pizza rocked.

We shared the Thai Die Pizza which had curry chicken and tasted awesome. The crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when I bit into it. I am a traditional pizza guy but this diversion worked.

Great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off.

I'll be heading back...soon",1
"Fantabulous! That's the best way I can describe the food here.

I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate. Unfortunately, between my hunger and the amazing aroma wafting off the plate, the camera never made it out. This dish, by the way, was the strozzapreti. I could go on about how wonderful it was, but I'll spare the reader. Oh, there were also the Zucca chips. I nearly bit the waiter's hand off when he tried to remove the scraps.

In truth, I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food, without a doubt, warrants that rating. However, the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable. The acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience. Oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive. She was great, very nice, on top of everything... but just a little too much.

Overall I'd like to go again and try out some more of what they have to offer! (And of course, have more zucca chips...)",1
"I really want to like MADCAP. I love the idea of playing old b-movies and some forgotten favorites. The boyfriend and I went to MADCAP last weekend to see their Chuck Jones presentation. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed, not that it was completely MADCAP's fault but still.

My biggest problem with MADCAP is the price of admission. $10! That's more than a new movie. Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.  There wasn't even a screen in the theatre - just a white wall.

If they showed new independent movies for $10 and old movies for $5 I think they would really have something cool going on. I hope they can figure it out because I'd really like to see the place become what it could be.",0
"I've been a Da Vang devotee for years and wanted to try a new Vietnamese place tonight and Pho Thanh didn't fall short. In fact, I think I might like this place a little better than Da Vang, but I'll rotate between the two since they're both so good.

First off, the portions are gigantic! The Bun bowl could easily serve two and I had tons of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. They use the fat rice noodles instead of the vermicelli, but I think it made the dish a little heartier and certainly easier to eat with chopsticks.

Hubby had the Pho and the broth was amazing! Savory, a little salty, and the spices were perfect. Perfect to warm your bones on a rainy day.

The restaurant was more of a cafe style than family sit down, but exceptionally clean and the service was great. There was quite a diverse crowd in there for a Sunday night and everyone's dishes looked fantastic.",1
"Cheese Curds!   They have been so hard to find in AZ.    Like the Jalepeno ones too.

Really good fresh milk.   Worth the stop.

Bring cash, not credit or debit cards",1
"I've been to Silver Spoon once, I need to go back to really make the decision if I like it or not.  I went in the summer, it was kinda hot in there-- like most places in the summer but, the heat makes me grumpy.  SO I need to go back when the weather is normal.

I got a salad-- it was massive, a little too much dressing for my liking.  Okay, A LOT of too much dressing but I ate it anyway. 

I'll probably try something else next time.  The staff was nice, the snarky guy that someone mentioned was snarky, buy snarky in a fun loving way, at least that is how I took it.  Snarky can come off all wrong and bad if not done correctly or if you just aren't in the mood for it, or if you yourself is snarky too-- then it's a disaster.  

It's close by my work so the fact that I have not returned makes me keep it at a 3 star review.",0
Love this lake. Went paddle boarding a few weeks back here and had the best time. Lake water is so clean you can almost see the bottom. Highly recommend this lake if you love water sports and fishing :),1
"I have been going to Cartel for a while, and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me. I can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else, I even buy their beans and brew it at home.
Most of the bartista's are stellar, but expect to wait for your specialty drinks, not only because they are almost always busy, but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time.
I suggest either the Honduras with cream, an iced agave latter, or a cappuccino (which you have to drink there).",1
"Great place. Sushi was not wrapped up tied enough so it tended to fall apart. Also the roll was a bit thick that it is hard to fit it in your mouth (yeah, that's what she said:)",1
"This review is for the new children's library on the campus.

The new library is BEAUTIFUL!  I'm hoping that without a lot of kid traffic it may be a sanctuary for teachers who want to be able to find the books they need to bring to their classrooms and share with their students.  They don't have as large of a selection as Burton Barr, but they do have some titles you can't find at the other branches.  The shelves are well stocked but not so tightly packed that browsing becomes a chore.  It's peaceful (like a library should be), but it could use some more seating. 

I have to be honest that I find the coolest part of this library to be the tiny cafe at the back - they serve Starbucks coffee and tasty pastries at very decent prices.  

Books, coffee, and sweets plus silence and organization...... It's like heaven!

If only it weren't so far away from me....",1
"basically, i'm only reviewing this store because i really do not care for the employees here. there are a few nice ones, but overall, they are either cranky, stressed out, or missing.

the redeeming points? a nice selection of crafting products. but then again, you can always just go to a DIFFERENT location. i'd opt for that.",0
"Never been in - but I get pizza delivered from them now and then. I am a New Yorker and to call me a pizza snob probably doesn't go far enough.

The crust is crispy, thin, and foldable, the outside edges, crispy and bubbly. Great mozzarella. I have never been disappointed by a topping. A little greasy, as it should be; it reminds me of NY pizza, and that's a big compliment coming from me.

We don't have a Ray's in Central Phoenix... but we do have Mamma Mia's. 

Yo! Tony! You make a good pizza.",1
This place is delicious. Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff. I would eat there everyday if I could afford it.,1
"This place does it right, but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top.",1
"I just love Chipotle. Fresh, yummy, spicy (if you want it to be). And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus! My personal fav is the chicken burrito, no rice, no beans w/ fajita veggies, pico, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Guacamole and hot sauce on the side. So delicious!!! The person who did our order was so nice! It was my friend's first Chipotle experience! She was impressed by how big the burrito was. I'm glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back.",1
"This one is consistent every time I come to this restaurant.
Good flavor, good service. 
On occasion the fixings selection is a little ""off"". Brown lettuce and those tasteless winter tomatoes. But the good thing about a burger is that they are still good wiht just the basics.",1
"LOVE Oregano's! They have delicious pizza, pasta, salads, wings, everything. The portions are huge and the prices are right and I can honestly say I've never not left Oregano's full and satisfied! Plus the atmosphere is fun as well. If you've saved room after your meal, try the pizookie, it's amazing. Giving 4 stars because there is always a huge wait and they don't take reservations or seat you until everyone is there, and also because the deep dish pizza was far too cheesy and saucy when I tried it (more than a deep dish should be) but everything else is superb.",1
"I'm somewhere in between three and four stars. And, I know there are Yelp ""Talk"" events taking place right this very second as I sit to type my review, and it is for this reason I appreciate what anonymity I have so I won't be egged as I walk out my door in the morning. And, it is possible that I expected something earth shattering within the vicinity of so much greatness (read: Pizzeria Bianco)

First of all - I had to approach the bar for service, refills and a check. Granted there was one guy running the place at 3:30 in the afternoon, but my friends and I were three of five people at the entire property. They weren't busy. 

We sat out on the patio and watched all the folks across the walkway start to congregate outside Pizzeria Bianco in the rain. It was an unbelievable an hour and a half prior to opening, they have at least two seatings of Guests waiting in the rain - I swear there's got to be something addictive in that crust. I love Bianco, I do, but I am also (sometimes) very logical. Show up at 5 p.m., go find a great patio table at the Rose and Crown, or Bar Bianco and have some wine for a couple of hours prior to dinner - don't stand in the rain for an hour and a half!

But, I digress...we're discussing the Rose and the Crown. Okay. Cute, compartmentalized rooms, yes. Homey feel, yes. Good selection of beer, yes. Good wine, no. Well made cocktails, yes. Menu, eh, okay. Service, eh, poor to okay.  Patio seats, rocking good! The trees changing colors, yellow leaves everywhere, perfect. People watching, phenomenal. Fish and Chips, pretty good. The friends I shared the experience with, too good to be true!",0
"First time eating Cambodian food. I am not sure what it's supposed to taste like so it's hard to say if this is what cambodian food is....

Small, quiet place. Entrance was non-initutive to us for some reason, we walked in the kitchen. It's the door on the left if anyone was curious. 

On a Monday at lunch, we were the only people in there around noon. 

I didn't know what to order but I like shrimp so I went for it. I went  for the Shrimp Ling rice combo. It comes with soup, rice and a pickled salad. 

The dish comes on a nice square plate so it makes the food 50x fancier just because it's on a square plate. Lots of shrimp in my plate ~ about 10ish and they're large. The shrimp was grilled and it tasted good but I wouldn't call it amazingly good that I was in love. I ate it and I like it but I thought to myself 'What is Cambodian food because the flavors don't seem unique? It seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce, maybe sugar, added more salt and maybe one or two other spices."" FYI - There's bunch of green onions in the shrimp, I think they add that more flavor. They aren't chopped into small pieces, it's like the whole stem but I ate everything. I always eat everything - I don't waste my food (it's almost like a sin not to finish your food unless you take it home... so nevermind).

The pickled salad was refreshing. I like the soup, it was lukewarm and it reminded me of a Chinese wintermelon homecooked soup. It's like a mixed of Chinese style chicken broth with Vietnamese beef broth without the saltiness and msg. Adding the green onions to the soup definitely makes it 50x better as well - WOOHOO. 

My dish was $8 - pretty good price. Thumbs up to that!

Overall, would I go back? Eh - I don't know. I need to try other Cambodian places or maybe I should just have googled about it...maybe Vietnamese food is better? Apparently, the countries are located near each other so it's similar to Vietnamese food.",0
"I'm on a low carb diet right now, so I had to pass on the pizza, unfortunately.  I was expecting to order a house salad with chicken.  When I told the server my diet limitations, she suggested a side of meatballs for about $4.  It was perfect.  I had the smallest bill at the table, and the meatballs were homemade and plenty tasty.",1
"I like to think of Trader Joe's as a ""specialty food/health market."" It is simply in a league of its own when compared to large commercial grocery chains. Honestly, there is no comparison! 

With that being said, this is the BEST Trader Joe's I have been too! (and I have shopped quite a few in my travels across the US) The sheer size of this store, in TJ standards, is IMPRESSIVE!  The isles are plenty large enough for TWO people (with carts) to maneuver through.  And more importantly EVERYTHING looks fresh and delectable!  

Some of my fav's are: 

$3.99 Trader Joe's Coastal Cab...FABULOUS for the price! (Quite honestly though, I haven't EVER had a bad wine at Traders...they have an amazing selection that isn't overwhelming but isn't sparse either.) I also LOVE that they CLEARLY label each of the wines and/or regions so they are quick and easy to find! 

The Haircot Verts (French Green Beans) are simply delicious! Their Brussel Sprouts are the perfect size and quantity; just enough for two people at two different meals.  They even have Nulaid ""Ready Egg"" (i.e. egg beaters) for $3.69! At the grocery store the SAME stuff will cost you TWICE that!! 

Their cheese selection is delightful with almost ANY kind of cheese imaginable! Their artesian breads are so yummy...although not a ""low fat/fat free"" food, so that is a once every few months splurge. (and even then we only get the small loaf (which I want to say is called a ""little bastard."" That name CRACKS me up!) 

And although I am not a ""sweet"" eater, my hubs is...so he has a dozen or so goodies that he constantly gets here. The one I can think of off the top of my head are their Chocolate Covered Joe Joe's with Peppermint Crumble (or something like that.) I'd go look at the box but we are fresh out because the hubs thinks that eating one box over a two-three day period is acceptable! 

It also fun to be rewarded for bringing your own reusable bags; as any good eco-friendly shopper would do! There is a weekly drawing for a TJ's gift card (I think the value is $25) and you get a ticket when you bring your own bags. (not one for each bag...just one ticket for bringing them to put your goodies in) Then they draw a name out of all the tickets (which you drop in a box on your way out of the store) once a week.  

If you shop more than once a week, you can ""earn"" a ticket for each time you shop there in a week therefore increasing your chances of winning. (although I am PRETTY sure the majority of Surprise/Sun City Grand shop there so maybe the odds aren't THAT great! )

Regardless, this is just a great little ""market"" through and through. I used to get excited to shop at TJ's...now I am always looking for an excuse to buy something just so I can go there! (and it's not just to try and win the gift card either..that's an added bonus!)",1
"Our group was not pleased with the quality of  the seared tuna salad (everything about it was low quality and just not tasty) and the quality of the grilled cheese (Velveeta cheese?) sliders.  The cuban sandwich was pretty good, though it's not enough to make us want to go back for more.  On the good side, our server was really nice and sitting outside was very pleasant and breezy.  I hope the food improves.",0
"The fitness part of this place is great: machines are new and plentiful.  Good classes on the schedule, and plenty of cold water and fresh towels.

Now, the spa, on the other hand, is mediocre at best.  The pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel; same with the jacuzzi, which also means the jacuzzi is outside!  Why no jacuzzi inside?  The steam room is small and there is no sauna.  There are only 3 shower stalls, with shampoo and shower gel, but no conditioner. The lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing.  And the robes are super thin (with a chilly room; that's not even nice!) and not very big.  I had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone. Hello! haha.

The massage itself was very nice, but the spa is not relaxing, especially for the prices.  I wouldn't return to the spa, although the gym is good.",0
Great food!!!  Everything on the menu is good.  The bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection.,1
I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.,0
"Brookstone is the Sharper Image's older and more laid back cousin.  Yea, it's got a similar feeling, but it's more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys.  The massaging chairs, pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone.  And if you're with a partner who's less interested than shopping, it's a great place for them to just hang out too!  (Trust me - this works.)",1
"Three stellar write-ups pushed me over the edge and I decided that it was time to take my self for a much needed pedi. When I arrived, the place was packed, but thankfully they gladly take walk-ins and I had only a brief wait before I was whisked away to my massaging, bubbling chair of goodness.

I have to echo the other reviewer's comments on cleanliness and down-right bargain for the service provided. Not once did I have that ""eww, you aren't actually going to touch me with that"" reaction. I didn't swoon from toxic vapors as soon as opening the door. And my attendant was super friendly and completely cool with the fact that I had clearly neglected my heals for the last two months (something that was hugely apparent after she started filing away - how mortifying... skin flying everywhere!!!)

And for those of you that might fear the Elaine experience (Seinfeld reference), fret not. You can actually understand everyone one that works here and shouldn't find yourself sitting and wondering ""what in the hell are they saying about me now?""

Take your twenty-bucks (plus a little extra for tip - unless you get flowers you will need thirty) and go get some much deserved pampering. 

Dear Paulene - my toes and heals thank you for the love! -- see pic ; )",1
This is one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix!! I love the $5 wine glasses during happy hour!! The bruschetta is out of this world!! The sundae with salted caramel and pretzels is probably one of the BEST things I have ever eaten!! :o),1
"We went here because it was the only decent place we could find open after the Suns game. Fresh fish sandwich was delicious, as well as the shoestring fries. Great service, nice vibe, I'd go back.",1
"I can't believe it took me this long to visit Sportsman's but now that I have, I know I'll be making my way back soon enough! Sportman's is a combination wine bar and retail store for spirits, wine, champagne and beer galore. Plus it's locally owned by the Basha's family! 

I like Sportsman's because it's a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol. The walls are lined from the floor to the ceiling with every type of alcohol. The prices range from $10 - thousands of dollars! It's pretty easy to find any type of brand here. Since it's the holiday season, they are currently offering sales on several of their high-end brands which makes it easy to visit for the purchase of a gift! I also like the fact that guests can visit the intimate bar area and sip on some beverages to take a break from shopping. They also make customized gift baskets!",1
"The Fries Need Work! I have been here several times now and the fries have been a disappointment . They are not the crispy fluffy potatoey goodness that Belgian fries are supposed to be.

Having said that, everything else from the brats to the beer to the service is worth the trip.

The outside patio is like being at a German Biergarten without all the kitch.

Check it out!",1
"oooooooooh man am I SO GLAD this place isn't near my house, I would gain 20 pounds in no time! 

My sister took me here for the first time a couple weeks ago and my mind was blown by all the unique flavors they served! 

The shop itself is very cute and modern. I like that they have a section in the back with a bunch of board games, very cool. 

As for the ice cream I got the dutch chocolate and the horchata. The horchata was so so good, I cant stop thinking about it! 

The following week I took the husband there. Again the ice cream was very good but the service was terrible. It was an older lady behind the counter and she really couldn't care less that we were standing there. She let me sample an ice cream and then I just stood there for a good 5 minutes while she did other things behind the counter. We did finally get served but my husband wasn't impressed with the serves one bit. This time I got my ice cream in a waffle cone, the cone was so light and airy, I loved it!",1
Puttanesco pizza (artichokes) was delicious and the service is all very quaint and efficient.. They even have gluten free pizza crust. Happy hr drink is 1.00 off all drink choices which I love since I can order whatever I like,1
"I don't know if it tastes like Chicago or not but it's reasonably safe to say that the stuff is cooked to order and consistently greasy and overstuffed, so maybe it is like Chicago?

The atmosphere is cool I guess, but I'm a Bears fan so it's cool seeing the old memorabilia on the walls.",0
"I recently visited the Arizona Science Center, & today came to check this one out, joined by Mike C.  Ok, it's not the same thing, but I'd say this one rules!  There's plenty to see here, It's fun for both adults & kids.  A couple of the excellent features are an old MINE to go through, & lots of DINOSAURS!!    :-))

The walkways kind of wind all over the place, so try to keep track of where you've been, & not miss anything.  They've put a lot of work into this museum, & you're going to like it!

Open Tue thru Fri 10-5, Sat 11-5, Sun 1-5, Closed Monday.

Adults:  $10
Kids 3-12:  $6
Students 13+ with ID:  $8
Seniors 65+:  $9",1
"Ate here again this weekend and I am happy to say that Fudd's has officially won me back.  The burger was positively delicious!!!!  And this time, I ordered the fries without the seasoning they add to it. Perfect! Hey, I'm a french fry traditionalist, what can I say? I hate weird seasonings or funky toppings on my fries (see review for Greek Gyro Express... and try to keep your cookies down).",1
"It's a taqueria in a Latino supermarket.  Nothing special but you have choices. 

They will have just about everything you may like. It's not gourmet and some things are just sitting in the pans but at least you can look at what you want.

I'd go back if I just needed something quick....",0
"I've probably passed by this place a thousand times without ever stopping in before today. As others have pointed out, it's small and intimate, but I liked the charming atmosphere.

I ordered the Seasoned Grilled Chicken on Cibatta and a Desert Blossom Iced Tea (lavender, hibiscus, apricot and rosehips). The sandwich was well balanced and moist. It was served with iceberg, roma tomatoes and a side of their house fries, ""Kilo Fries."" The fries were seasoned with a cheese blend, which seemed a little dry to me. However, a quick swirl in olive oil improved them quite a bit. The tea was delicate and refreshing - a nice complement to my lunch selection.

The service is what stood out for me here. My server was friendly and attentive throughout the meal, even though I was dining solo. I certainly felt that my business was valued here. She even offered me a to-go cup for my tea, which was a nice touch.

I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu. Prices are reasonable too, which doesn't hurt!",0
"What an amazing place!!  I had an incredibly enjoyable time staying at the Royal Palms Resort, and recommend it highly.  So many excellent points:  absolutely gorgeous accommodations, polite and helpful staff, excellent restaurant (breakfast/ brunch outside, with a delicious cup of coffee, is a must), a great spa, and a relaxing atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I stayed here for a conference in late October, which is a great season in Arizona.  Our stay was a pleasure from beginning to end.  The resort is well-suited for special occasions (there was a wedding reception and an outdoor conference dinner during our stay).  Our room was very comfortable, with excellent set-up and a great view of the mountains from the balcony.  The resort includes a pool, a small gym, several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces, and the wonderful Alvadora spa (with massages, facials, outdoor-facing showers, and shaded lounge areas to your heart's content).  There are several mountain trails a short walk/ drive away from the resort, and downtown Scottsdale is 10-15 minutes away by car.  In all, a beautiful place for a special occasion!",1
I have been patronizing Casey Moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night!  Great for people watching and the service is always great!  Get there early or it will be standing room only!,1
"Tasty Kabob is kind of a throw away name, but the service and food are excellent. The hummus is good, not the best I have ever had, but it is better than many places I have been to. The chicken kabob was excellent, I am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma, but it is excellent. I had the gyro platter and that was also excellent. 

What I really do not understand is why Pita Jungle is so packed and this place is empty. The food is more authentic and frankly tastes better in my opinion. No more Pita Jungle for me. When I am in the area, I will go to Tasty Kabob.",1
"Very yummy, my favorite roll is the Las vegas, and here they make a good one and it's 1/2 off during happy hour. I keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi! Try the Ice Cream sushi roll, this is one of the only places I know that does it and it is delicious!",1
"After shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area I stumbled into this little gem.   Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority, but I am sure could be ordered if needed.    This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk, there just isnt any here! Only quality sought after items.  Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated.   When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even.  This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen.   There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available.    After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered.   Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in.   If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly, knowledgeable, and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place.   Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby.",1
"This is the closest Pita Jungle to my office. I love the food and often call ahead and just pick up because this parking lot is a damn nightmare during the lunch rush. If you are dining in though, things do move very quickly. I appreciate the staff at this location not being the usual apathetic hipster PJ is known for. The manager guy here, don't know his name, really knows what he is doing. My favorite to-go dish is the chicken shwarma wrap. It has PICKLES like all wraps with chicken should :)  I also love the glazed chicken pizza...omg caramelized onion-y goodness with chunky feta, how can you go wrong. And it's huge so you get two meals. Other faves: hummus with chicken, black bean burger, cilantro jalapeno hummus with pita chips, tzatziki, broiled chicken salad for when I want something really light.",1
"Finally made my way up to this little joint.  Owned by a couple of people who live in-State, not a corporate chain but they do have multiple locations.  

Had the DeeZee.  Tasty lamb,garbanzo,potato mixture in a thick stew with a side of flavorful broth ""soup"" for slurping.

Son had chicken kebab, very tender, very juicy, flavorful and served with basmati rice which went well with my lamb too!  Came with a cool roasted Roma tomato, spicy red onion pieces and more pita than we could eat.

Had the hummous, its simple & tasty but too ""chilled"", next time I will ask for an extra plate and stir it up real well before we dip.

GOOD SERVICE.  Friendly order takers give input on the food.  HAPPY with my selections.  We'll be back.  Two full meals with leftovers, hummous and 2 drinks for under $25!",1
"When I came here I got half a dozen donuts and one of those boba drinks. The donuts were really good, but I wouldn't say they were any better than a Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. The boba drink was so good though! I'm really happy they have those. :)",0
Pretty good coffee. Nothing special but better than starbucks by far.,0
"This is a true gem! I took my dog there after bouncing around trying to find the right groomer for him. I read the reviews and gave this place a try. I was really happy with the customer service, the service performed on my dog, the fact I got a same day appt, and most importantly....my dog did not seem to be anxious or uncomfortable. He normally leaves a groomer stressed and not himself, but he seemed to be at complete ease here!",1
"Some of the food here is fantastic such as the Chicken Corfu $14.95 and others like the Gyro I found to be less than good becasue the meat was very dry some parts burnt with the obviously strong taste of fish.  I sent it back and they took it off our bill.  The remainder of the meal which consisted of the Corfu, salads and soup was great and our waitress; the owners daughter promised to address the Gyro with the kitchen.  This restaurant is located at the park in Fountain Hills with unobstructed views of the lake and fountain which erupts every hour spraying water more than 500 feet in the air.  We took a nice walk in the park after dinner which was very relaxing.  Recommended",1
"Innovative venue. Bleacher seating in the back is a bit odd, but it works. Dig the long bar at the far end of the hall. Excellent sound. Haven't tried the food yet, but I intend to investigate.",1
"burger heaven! I had THE PIG Burger... it. was. delicious.  and it was served on a pretzel roll.  mmmmmm

Good vibe feeling in Circle H, I like the pictures on the walls, the bar look, the entire environment was relaxed and easy going.  I came the day of the official ribbon cutting, so I got to see that happen (i had no idea those giant gold scissors were real scissors by the way.  i guess, that is a dumb though b/c what else would they be??) and it was nice to see everyone gathered for this moment.

The french fires were piping hot and delicious, they have all sorts of sides like slaw, beans, mac n cheese etc.  

I also had a bite of the brisket sandwich.  It was so very very good, I am ordering that next time I go back.  

Local beers on tap, good price too.

Great start for a new restaurant, there were of course the new hickups, but those kins get worked out with more time. Nothing to worry about.  That's how you learn!!",1
Great prices and fresh food ...,1
"This location has 2 businesses. A bar and a grill. I never entered the bar. I only eat at the grill for breakfast. I love the food though. This is a great, greasy spoon when you don't care about exotic ""gourmet"" concoctions an upscale location or an eye catching electronic sign. This place serves your standard menu items. Quality food,  reasonable prices and low overhead. Just the way I like it! The other reviewers commented on the owner and her abrasive nature. I agree she is abrasive but only at first glance. She is funny and sweet if you give her a chance.",1
We purchased a Groupon deal and went and tried this restaurant . The food is excellent and the service is very good . If you are wanting real Texas BBQ then this is the place to go!,1
"After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.

* Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.

* French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.

* Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.

Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!",0
"What can I say about this place? I love it. Its straight up the road from my place. You can find everything here, not just Asian food. When I get a hankering for Bombay spice, off to Lee Lee I go. I love LOVE their meat counter. I get chills deciding which pork hocks I want. The fish fry service is nice. They have stuff I can't live without and can't find anywhere else i.e. aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course, the makoks. The cashiers can be a lil raunchy though just smile and nod. And a little known secret? The vegetables are freshest on Fridays.",1
"Located in the space formerly occupied by LGO's short lived Radio Milano, the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room, a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group.

I dined here recently for the hubby's work dinner. Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room, the Arcadia Room is a cool, casual, restaurant - all to your self.

We had about 60 in our group, and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room, or gather by the open kitchen.The weather was blazing hot when we were there, but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests.

I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare.",1
"I am an avid quilter and moved here recently. I am on the hunt for a new quilt shop and I went here, despite the ""grandma quilt shop"" name lol. The staff was VERY nice and helpful and friendly. The shop a little on the small side, which made me surprised to find that they have a very decent selection of contemporary fabrics! My only disappointment is that that they don't have fat quarters cut of each of the fabrics, though they will cut fat quarters - but that's not something I want to have to wait around for. 

They carry a small selection of minky and home dec fabrics as well. I will definitely be back there!",0
"I wanted to add a review to the actual company's website, but I could not figure it out. I'm curious where all the testimonials came from. 

I have mixed feelings on my experience. In the end, I think I ended up with some beautiful windows, though. My salesperson was very engaging. I felt pretty confident in my decision to go with American Vision Windows after that first experience. There was some miscommunication on scheduling the measurement, but it worked itself out fairly quickly. I started to lose confidence when I was told a specific date that my windows would be in, but never heard anything from the company four days after that date. When I called them to find out where my windows were, I was told they had just received them and they could schedule my install in 2 weeks. Since I only had Saturday install available, that was understandable. The Friday before my install, they called to reschedule to the following weekend because the rainstorm (that just occurred that day) had put them behind two days. Again, I guess that was fairly understandable, but I felt like the peon that was the easiest to push off. 

Luckily the installers did show up the following Saturday on the earlier side of the provided time frame. I kind of don't know what to say about the install. There were two guys, one seemed to know what he was doing, the other I had less confidence in. The job took 4 hours to install 6 windows. During the entire transaction I was never told how long the install would take, so I'm not sure if that was normal or not. The two guys actually seemed to be fighting during the entire install. I believe the head guy was joking around with the other by basically telling him he sucked. I think the other guy was genuinely getting angrier and angrier. In all honesty, I was very uncomfortable being in my own house while the install was going on. I was a bit disappointed in the cleanup of the job. I ended up having to cleanup inside the window tracks and windowsills on the inside and brush off the sills on the outside. I don't feel I should have had to do that. Before they left, I was handed a survey to review the entire process (salesperson, overall experience, install). I think that is a horrible practice that needs to be changed. I didn't want to sit there writing out a review on all of the above while the installer is waiting for me, and then hand it right back to him. What it did cause me to do is overstate my review because I'm not going to give the installers 2 stars and hand the paper back to the person I just reviewed. 

I can't say I would recommend this company, but I feel the way customer service has been going, it's really a tossup on what you will get from any company.

P.S. I forgot to mention my plants. I have recently spent a lot of my own time and money on landscaping my backyard so this stuck out to me big time. I understand when installing windows it's difficult to pay attention to the foliage below your feet, but I think some attempt to not trample all over the plants would be very much appreciated. For example, when washing the windows, I think an effort can be made not to stand directly on top of a plant and twist your foot back and forth. I'm still hoping I do not loose a couple of plants due to the trauma they endured.",0
"We have some friend who were RAVING about this place, so we popped in for a sandwich before a movie recently.  I gotta say, I had a great reuben sandwich that I was VERY pleased with.  I'm not sure if I will be venturing to the area just to have this sandwich again, but it was super tasty.  Everyone seemed to like what they had and the menu has something for everyone.  If I'm in the area again, I might venture here, but I am partial to Jimmy John's (next door) so it might be hard to choose.",0
Great decor. Great food and very good service. You have to try the pork belly pastrami. To die for! Their version of the Manhattan was very good. As for the main courses you can't go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck. For dessert go with the black & tan pudding. Oh soooo good. Highly recommend this place.,1
"I was only here for one night on 9/7, but I was very pleased with my stay.  The place is beautiful, the rooms are big, and the people at the front desk were pleasant and efficient.

The only down side to my stay was that I lost water pressure in the shower Friday night.  Fortunately, it was only brief.  Other than that, I enjoyed my stay.  This will be my base of operations for my next visit.

As for others' comments that there isn't anything nearby - That's what cars are for.  Last I heard you can rent them here and there.",1
"So, yesterday morning, I actually had a prego craving.  I was in the mood for a smoothie for breakfast.  My traditional early morning oatmeal or yogurt breakfast was not going to do.  Baby wanted something else.  

I head on over to this Jack-in-the Box, which is close to work.  I pull up, order my strawberry banana smoothie, and am promptly told that the ""machine is broken"".  Uh...well that sucks!  I pull up to the window and the person tells me that the machine is leaking (at least I think that's what he said).  But would be about 10 minutes and it would be up and running.  

Now knowing the smoothie issues I had this morning, I dont think that the machine was broken.  The product just wasnt ready yet.",0
"Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal... Yummmayyyy

ever since i've moved away from arizona, i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most.. their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger.. their general tso's chicken extra spicy is my bf's favorite.. almost everything is good here!!",1
"I ordered a cappuccino, my typical order at a new place and it was very good with a pretty heart design on top which made me smile. The espresso was perfect and did not require any sweetener. I also got a blueberry muffin which wasn't very good, perhaps it was low fat or something but I am very picky about pastries anyway. 

My biggest problem with this place is the fact that they do not have a bathroom. Coffee makes me have to pee and when I discovered this and had to walk all the way to the baby gap because the place next door with a bathroom wasn't open yet requiring me to pack up my computer and leave my drink and food unattended, it was a bit undesirable. I know it's a mall type area but it still surprised me for a drink/food place. It does not set the tone for a place to spend a lot of time which may be their intention. Also, I love John Mayer but they played his same songs over and over again. Perhaps mixing it up or putting on a pandora station would be better? 

The staff was nice and they have free WiFi. 

I will return for the espresso but get it to go.",0
"THis place is great! I need an adjustment every now and then but I live in Scottsdale and my regular Chiropractor is so good that he is always booked up ahead of time, so if I tweek my back unexpectedly I can't get in soon enough quite often. So.. now I have a place to go seven days a week that is every bit as good as my normal Chiro. I have only gone to the weekend chiro but my wife and one of my employees have seen Dr. Brian and they love him. So if you need a good Chiro... go see these guys any day of the week. Try em you'll love em!",1
"This was a great place to go with the parents for Thanksgiving.  Dinner was served family style and it was a ton of food!  Started with a plate of 3 different bruschetta appetizers that were excellent.  Then had a choice of 2 salads, 2 meats - we had turkey that was served with a focaccia dressing and the tilapia served with a side of some of the best creamed spinach I ever had - then 2 side dishes in addition - mashed sweet potatoes and mashed garlic potatoes that were just okay - 2 pasta dishes - we had the signature Rigatoni D and the angel hair with pomodoro sauce/sausage - and 2 desserts!

It is a little pricey, but for the amount of food they serve and all the leftovers, I think it's worth it.  The best way to go here is with a group and do the family style menu.

I've been to other Maggiano's in Chicago and to me, they're all pretty much the same - good and plentiful food and fast friendly service.",1
"Just when I'm about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale, I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough. Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design. A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel. Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door. 

The food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre. It will pay off handsomely.",1
"Wow, love that a place like this moved in down the street. 
Inexpensive, fresh, delicious - everything I want in a mexican restaurant.
My soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic -- freshly prepared and topped with guacamole, which by the way is super creamy. Basket of chips are free, as is the toppings bar -- every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious. 
I plan on frequenting Salsa Blanca ; )",1
Apparently fellow yelper Andrew and I are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee! I'm seriously glad to see that I am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup! All of the products are top notch though and who doesn'tlike creme brulee? Communists maybe? Chef Eric is awesome and so friendly too.,1
"Of course, they are no La Madeliene, but if you are looking for some good croissants, this is the place to be. I love, love, love their croissants. But which bakery's croissants do I not love? hmm... But I do love theirs. I have had the almond croissant, the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there, I had the chocolate croissant. It was just freaking amazing. That's all I can say. (They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some)

I have also had lunch here before, some Mediterranean sandwich stuff. The portion is very small compared to the price. Their macaroons look crazy and funky. Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time. I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird. But its okay, I will compromise Essence Bakery. 

They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants. Wow.",1
Nice little find for casual sushi,1
I thought the place had a lot to offer with the atmosphere and the ingredients used in the all of the dishes.  I only thought that the menu spoke louder than the dish.,0
"They came to my house the same day that I called which was a pleasant surprise.  I'm glad that I didn't have to wait a week for them to fix our fuse box.

With labor at $65 per hour it's pretty affordable depending on what you want them to do.  Be aware that there might be two guys coming out to you though- so it'll be $65 per hour x2.",1
"Back to Joe's.... been several years as we are Westside dewelers and on Mother's Day we had Mom & Dad with us and suggested Joe's after the hot experience out at Schenpf''s farm.  Glad we went, Joe's really is quite tasty, is it the best? - Probably not but that is all relative!  For the SE Valley, it's our go to spot for BBQ.  We had the ribs, pulled pork, the Jumbo tater with Pork, coleslaw, mac & Chz, lemon cake, sweet patato pie.  All were really quite tasty.  The ""HOT"" sauce isn't THAT hot... but good lil kick.  One time we will be there when it's not as hot out and get to try that nice large outdoor seating!  - I gotta say the Lemon Cake kicks ass!",1
"I just got back from my first visit ti Jacks All In Social Club. I'll be go back. I found the place a nice place to play a hand or two of Texas Hold'em poker. The owners are nice couple want to provide a nice, clean, and safe place to play poker. They have succeed.",1
I crave their jalapeno fried rice. AMAZING!,1
We had brunch at El Chorro today and it was wonderful. The patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. I had the creme brulee french toast - it was carb/sugar heaven. Everyone else enjoyed their food. The eggs benedict came out perfect. The BLT looked awesome. The fries were delicious. We will definitely be back.,1
I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.,1
Ditto what Kristi M. said.  Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place.,1
"Let's rewind four years:

""You've never been to Chino Bandido?""
""No, what is it?""
""How long have you lived here?""
""About eleven years, but a bunch of those years were when I was a toddler, and I just moved back from a few years in Flagstaff.""
""And you've never been to Chino?""
""NO. What is it?""
""Amazing.""
""Take me there.""
""Okay.""

Yet we never went.

On the drive home from the Children's Museum of Phoenix, I realized that I was hungry, on a budget, and Chino Bandido was not too far off of path.  I ran the plan by my father, checking to make sure that would be an appropriate Father's Day dinner.  I received a confused look and thumbs up.  He's not the most adventurous when it comes to dining experiences, but is generally a good sport.

If my friend and I had been on the ball, I could have been eating here for four years.  Granted, I rarely have business around 19th and Greenway, but I could have made Chino Bandido my business.

We both ate a perfectly reasonably sized and delicious dinner for less than $10.  Three cheers for Caribbean influenced burritos and homemade teriyaki sauce.

Stevey P mentioned the only reason I'm giving four instead of five stars: If the dining room weren't so disgusting that I had trouble eating in it, it would easily be a five star place.  Wipe down the counters and tables, and perhaps give it a new coat of paint, and I'll be completely thrilled.",1
"Good Chinese food, great value -- especially for lunch.  China Village is one of my regular haunts for Chinese food when I'm in the neighborhood.  The building may look run-down, but the food and service are good.",0
"Lovely outdoor seating area, very dog friendly. Don't sit in the back of the outdoor seating area because it smells like propane back there. Had some coffee and just hung out for a couple of hours. It was a pleasant experience. Didn't order food this time but next time I will, because every dish that came by looked magnificent! All of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion.",1
"Great burgers and menu offerings.  You would expect to get a good burger with a name like that and you do.  The sweet potato fries, Frenched fried onions, and Salmon Salad are very good too.  

The decor, location, and menu are restaurant alternative for the area.  

The menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isn't an issue.  

I do recommend to restaurant to others.",1
"Good buffet, albeit it's a tad on the more expensive side in my opinion.  We came here for dinner on a Sunday night for their ""Super Buffet"" which was $15.99 per person.

This buffet offers a large selection of food...hot entrees, made to order sushi, Mongolian BBQ, soup, fresh fruit and salad, and dessert.  I liked the fried rice, chow mein, broccoli beef, string beans, and this dish with tofu.  The egg drop soup was really good and the hot and sour soup was decent.  

For a Chinese buffet, they offered some quality desserts since some of their offerings probably came from Costco like the red velvet cake and cream puffs.  

Service was friendly and polite.  Our waitress did a great job with clearing our plates and offering to refill our hot tea.  (Hot tea was $1.60 per person, by the way.)

The restaurant is spacious and appeared to be well maintained.  Parking is easy since there's plenty of spaces in the lot out front.",1
They had what i was looking for ... it wasn't easy to find but after asking 3 people I eventually found it. A folding table and shelving. The place is typically big and laid out like most other home depots. Know what to expect when you go and you won't be disappointed but if you want a lot of personal service stick to a local hardware store.,1
"i love this place and their food!
what i mainly love is that their prices are extremely reasonable now so i can go more often.
their steaks are very good as are their ribs and chicken
as for appetizers, i love the signature Bloomin' onion and i recently tried their wings and i love them! it must be the seasonings and sauce
they taste very different.
and the service is alway excellent 
but when you do plan on going, make a reservation to avoid waiting too horribly long",1
Good fish fry place. I've also had there Monster Burger- delish.,0
"I love Zoya! She does a phenomenal pedicure and eyebrow wax. I never have to wait. It is very professional there. The decor is beautiful and I always relax when I'm there. Zoya told me today that she does Swedish massages at their sister salon which is right across the way in the same parking lot. They have a hair salon in the other location as well. 

I have been going there for a while for the Happy Feet pedicure. Best exfoliation, great neck massage and paraffin wax for the feet. 

Ahhhhh...my feet are so happy right now!",1
"If you have ever eaten at an exceptional German restaurant, you will be ruined for life. Years ago, the Haus would have gotten 4 stars. But after being turned on to a little gem in Gibson City, IL called ""The Bayrn Stube"" my appreciation of fatty meat and spices stuffed in an intestine laid on a bed of sauerkraut and red cabbage has been forever changed. Haus just doesn't quite measure up. The cup of soup before the entree tasted like it came out of a can and the bread looked like the sheets of Hawaiian bread you buy at wally world. Probably the biggest turn off was when they brought out the brown mustard still in a plastic squeeze container. 
My meal was the Nuernberger/Kassler combo for one, and I had enough left over for breakfast the next day. Their sausages seem to be of lesser quality than I would get at Sunflower and the red cabbage had some pork gristle in it. Not that I mind a little pork fat in my cabbage, but not chunks, and definitely not gristle. My friend ordered the Huehner (Chicken) Schnitzel, which had a very good flavor, it was the best part of either of our meals. They do have a nice selection of good beers on tap, no Aventinus though. 
If the food was anything other than German, it would get 2 stars. It is nice to have somewhere to get a schnitzel when I'm in the area, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here.",0
"I dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had Nan's breakfast, Plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back. In 13-years (I live in Cali) been here 26 times and not fancy (although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside. I ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast",1
Who the heck doesn't love huge amounts of toilet paper and free samples of food... come on now!,1
"Canteen is my new favorite happy hour spot. You can get two orders of wonderful pork and habanero tacos, two orders of their tender ribs, an order of quite good chips and guacamole and a couple of margaritas for around twenty bucks, it's amazing. Add in the cool atmosphere and HUGE selection of tequilas(all half off during happy hour) and you have a recipe for success. Canteen is a very welcome addition to Mill Ave, and while it can get very loud, you simply cannot go wrong during happy hour.",1
"This was such a good experience
I was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache
I don't have health insurance so I didn't think I could afford a dentist
Friends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found A.T. Still
I called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1:pm
It was 11am but I didn't care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1p.m.
it cost $15 to be seen, $15 for the X-Rays, and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity

so they sent me up to oral surgery, it cost me $85 to get the tooth extracted
i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears
It didn't hurt at all, I was numbed up and the student did a good job

they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow - up
the follow up appointment is FREE!

totally recommend this place to any and everyone!",1
"Tott's is great pan-Asian food for a very reasonable price.  

One day at work one of my co-workers asked if I wanted to go out to lunch.  I agreed and we set out.  We each got 1 veto.  Hers was Panda Express, mine was Kyoto Bowl.  We kept driving and she remembered Tott's, and I've never bothered going to Panda again.

Great food and great service.  The owner is a small Asian man who smiles a lot and always wants to know if he can get us anything else.  I see him every time I go.

Everyone I go with loves their orange chicken.  It is very tasty, but a little on the sweet side for me.  I like a spicy dish, so I go with the Malaysian Curry.  Chicken, red curry, fresh veggies, fried rice.  Amazing.",1
"Barrio Cafe is an amazing Mexican restaurant.  Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza travels to Mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell - things are always fresh (they only have an ice cream freezer!), creative and authentic.  I am more than content w/ a mango margarita, the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros!!  Even when the restaurant is packed, the staff is friendly and informative.",1
I can't believe no one has talked about Pasta Tuesday. Definitely the best time to go but make sure you get there early because the pasta literally runs out. It is that good. They have this guy (Guido) come every Tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning. He picks 2 unique dishes. It was one of the best pasta I have EVER tasted. I crave it all the time. I had a fettucini noodle in a alfredo creme sauce with herbs and pine nuts on top. I can't even describe the taste (wow what a good food critic i am). You just have to go check it out. I am going TONIGHT!,1
"I like this place because of how original it is and the menu has something for everyone.

Unfortunately it is tucked away in a hard to spot location and therefore continues to be a great secret.

I would recommend to anyone in Arizona to make a trip over and see what this place is all about. I think everyone will be happy with it.",0
"I have had a couple of peels at A-Peeling Faces and they were the best I've ever had!  They are not only very reasonable priced, but Darla Salem really knows her stuff.  My skin has never looked better!  I am very pleased.",1
"This place was once known as J Chew and Company. I loved that place and this new version is still great.

So comfy, so casual, so welcoming and so non-scottsdaley it's just the best.",1
"Great work lunch. Valet parking, only. Waitress was helpful in narrowing down my selection (salmon salad) and listened to my criteria. 4 stars since wait staff seemed otherwise aloof.",1
"This is a small location but still packed with everything I need.  They did start stalking more womens vitamins I liked without iron because they were always out when I went in.  So I thank them for that!

Staff are always nice and for the most part an answer all of my questions.  They take an added effort to get to know their customers.  They always ask about my son when I go in and this keeps me coming back because I feel valued as a person not just a customer.",1
"The name is so misleading, because this is the most charming dining spot I've ever eaten! 

I dined here for lunch with a friend and was blown away by everything about it. First, it's location is tucked away near ASU campus in a quiet little neighborhood. It appears to be a converted home built in the early 1900's and lots of beautiful mature trees and plants growing in their huge, and I mean huge outdoor patio area. I only dined outside, but honestly with such beautiful weather 9 months out of the year here, why would you dine any other way! 

The service was excellent! The staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while I drank water and waited a while for my friend. The menu was amazing. I never once read a menu that I wanted to try everything on here. They had a huge variety of dishes at what I can only describe as American/French fusion. It all looked so divine. And from what I've been told, their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes. So I can't wait to see what they offer when I return. I went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche, fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup. The soup was so rich and creamy, I could have ordered and ate a whole trough! It was that good. The fruit was clean, well portioned and fresh. I'm very particular with fruit, and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened. And the quiche was heavenly as well. Just the right amount of ham and tomatoes with alot of flavor.

Since I was here for lunch only, the prices were reasonable. I've heard at dinner it can get expensive.

This was an unforgettable dining experience and recommend this to everyone to try at least once.",1
"There is nothing I enjoy more than a great Sunday brunch and St Francis did not let me down. The food and atmosphere were the perfect way to start off a relaxing day.  We had to wait about 25 minutes before getting seated but it was no problem because our server brought us drinks while we sat and enjoyed the live jazz music.  
My friend and I started off by sharing a GIANT cinnamon roll topped with caramel sauce. SO GOOD. We destroyed the pastry in minutes, which left both of us wondering how we were going to eat our meals. Fortunately, we are both gluttons and were able to pull ourselves together for round 2. I had the Eggs Benedict and roasted potatoes and my friend ordered the Wood-Oven Baked Eggs. Both were delicious. 
The only thing I didn't like was that the tables were very close together. At times it felt like we were dining with our neighbors. Overall I would highly recommend St Francis' brunch and I am eager to return again.",1
"Small, but well stocked.  All of the Japanese basics are here.  It's nice to have a local Japanese grocer and not have to resort to an Asian-Mega-Mart.  There's not a lot of fresh produce, but great frozen and dry goods options.  I'll have to try the prepared food sometime.  They were sold out for the day by the time I went in the afternoon.",1
"So I'm not a big Chinese food fan, but my husband is. Truth be told, it usually makes me sick. But if I were to go to Chinese food, Dragon Palace would be one of the places that I would go. The food is decent and there's a lot of it. I really felt I was getting my value's worth.

The waitstaff was attentive (always there asking if I wanted a refill) and the food came out quickly. It looks like every other Chinese food restaurant in the world (lots of red and gold, lanterns, paper Chinese Horoscope place mat -- save for the deep teal walls).  I'm not sure I would make a long drive to Dragon Palace because chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby, but if you live in the 32nd St. and T-Bird vicinity, this is certainly a Chinese food place worth trying. 

As for the food, we ordered the Peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup, a pu pu platter (consisting of won tons - yum -, eggroll, a small fried shrimp, a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken), Peking fried rice (fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef), Mongolian beef and the house chicken. (as an aside and a disclaimer, I am preggers right now and I have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means I, of course, hated the chicken dishes). My husband thought it all was ok. I really liked the won ton soup and the Peking fried rice. After dinner, we got the requisite fortune cookie (""Express yourself now."" WHAT?) and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing.

All in all, it was a good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant.",0
"The ambiance of this place is pretty great.  I made the comment while we were having diner that it would be a great place for a first date.  That way, if it is awkward, at least there is plenty to look at to make the time pass.  The food was pretty good for the price.  The service was also great.  I'd happily go back again.",1
"Both of the previous reviewers are correct, actually. Yes, there can be a line to the door at times, and not everyone working there is 100% nice 100% of the time. But who is? And, once you get to know them -- and are courageous enough to give them the benefit of the doubt -- everyone working there is very cool to deal with.

Because this Post Office is tucked way back in the Foothills, it's not staffed as heavily as I've seen some others. But the remoteness of the location also means you get to breeze in and out on rare occasions too (seeing as this is too far out of the way for any non-Foothills residents). So, do like me: never go here in a hurry; be polite; be patient (it's not all about you). And you'll see this is really no worse than any other Post Office...and maybe even a little bit better.",1
"Once again, family was out to try something new! I was in the mood for pizza. I noticed there were quite a few pizza joint in this area! So this was the first one we tried. We order a pepperoni and green peppers pizza well done, spaghetti and meatballs, and chicken Parmesan. The pizza was good, I enjoyed the flavors, pepperoni, cheese, and sauce was very good. I am not sold on the crust! But overall the pizza was still good. The spaghetti was very good, especially the meatballs! It takes a lot for me to like meatballs and these were one of the best I have tasted. Daughter hardly gave me a chance to taste the chicken Parisian, but what I did taste was really good, they do like to pile on the cheese, that's the way to get my daughters heart! Over all we had a great time, we love the small mom and pops atmosphere, and we will probably come back soon!",1
"This is a some what conflicted review.  Again, I wish Yelp would allow us to review multiple things. The staff was extremely friendly (maybe a tad too talkative), the location was nice and clean.  The food LOOKED great.

The pizza just wasn't that good. It's just way too sweet. And when I say sweet,  it's so extreme that it overshadows anything else about their pizza.  It's so different in taste, it makes it seem like the wrong sauce was used. (I know it wasn't)

If you don't like sweet sauce, then order something else as their was nothing else remotely wrong with the rest of my dinner. It's just I've had about 1000 other better pizzas.",0
If only they have more fresh produce I'd stop by a lot more often!,0
"I've been to this location a few times, but this was by far the best experience I've had. It was two Sundays ago, myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks. My friend called ahead and made a reservation. When we got there, we had a big table reserved right in front of all the TVs. Our waitress was very attentive, friendly and quick. They had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games, enjoying some beverages and eating some food. Their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and it'll keep me coming back. See ya next Sunday, Majerle's!",1
"Really, if I could, I would give this place zero stars, because it is a disgrace. If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area, go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St.(http://www.sonoraveterinaryspecialists.com/). It's also 24/7, but unlike VCA PVEAH, it is a truly valuable, legitimate facility, and it''s staffed by engaged, committed, deeply caring, and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel. At SVS, you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified.

VCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way. VCA is, in fact, the WORST of corporate animal service providers. The space is small, cheap, cramped, and the staff are indifferent at best and don't convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress. All they want is your money. They do NOTHING for the $99.75 they charge for an ""emergency exam."" We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate, literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody, traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication).  Furthermore, they tack on bogus surcharges ($5.25 for a ""biohazard waste fee"") that are irrelevant to the ""service"" provided, and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet, anyone?

Conversely, our (and our dog's) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency), and the cost was ultimately significantly less.

VCA is a money-grubbing, depressing, sham.",0
"A non-red meat eater walked into The Keg....that's how my story starts!  I am not known for making trips to a steakhouses but I have to say I like this place.  The staff are super friendly and are eager in helping you make a selection of drinks or food.  I highly recommend the Strawberry Lemonade!  Supposedly there's Gin in this drink but I did not taste a drop!  I tried the Teriyaki Chicken with a yummy pineapple cilantro salsa!  I chose the Twice Bake Potato as my side....omg there's bacon it!  This was amazing and I need the recipe!  They don't have a bad happy hour menu.  I won't change my non-red meat eating ways but I will continue to visit the Keg.  


*Side note: Yes I eat bacon.  I don't eat Red Meat by choice and not for a cause.",1
Super friendly staff and smoothies come out so fast...delicious too!,1
"This place is excellent.  Hands down, the best tacos I've had.  Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas.  I see people raving about some of the ""salsa bars"" at all of the 'berto's and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what Tacos Atoyac has to offer.  They care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft.

If you like the style of food here you must try Sonora Mesquite Grill on 46th Street and Thomas.",1
"Congratulations on opening the Gilbert location. Glad to see you guys making the shift to the far East Valley. As to be expected, the bruschetta was great. We really enjoyed the Syrah and the Sangiovese. It's really hard to beat the $5 glass/pitcher deal before 5pm, and the board + bottle ($20) on Monday and Tuesday night make for the perfect date night, though it can prove to create a long wait.

It was nice to see staff from the other locations making the move out here. Small mishaps and things that get confused in the midst of opening a new restaurant are bound to happen. No worries though, we've been 5 times in the first 10 days, showing that you guys are right on target. Looking forward to getting to know the staff and becoming weekly regulars.",1
"The ice cream floats were great! I know because we ordered 5 of them! 

The food on the other hand was not so good. We ordered the kids cheese pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches, pastrami, pastrami ruben and a cheese burger. The pizza was not edible (too hard). For the price of the entrees, it would have been nice to offer fries or fruit instead of chips or lower the price. 

The staff was attentive and nice!

The atmosphere was great for playing I spy.

Would visit again but only for soda and ice cream floats.",0
"Good chips and salsa, excellent service.  Friendly folks who greet you well and say good-bye when you leave.  MY staff love this place and I gave them gift cards for Xmas from here so they could go to lunch and talk about the boss!

Food is good but not great.  Not high-end Mexican but decent ingredients put together with care.  I highly recommend asking about their specials.  They are thinking about what they prepare and have some excellent dishes they have created themselves.  The spicy roast pork is very good - as an example.

Parking can be tough at peak hours.  I had to use the street last night and the place was absolutely packed.  Large lot but at peak hours...

Very good value.  You will leave knowing you have eaten something!

Decor is basic Mexican restaurant but comfortable.",1
"If you need a hat, this is where to go.",1
"Good little place in old town across from Cowboy Ciao. Had the turkey apple swiss wrap w/ dried cranberries,local greens, smoked bacon, and cashews. Very good and great size. The lady had the grilled chicken & sage pesto sandwich w/ goat cheese, gala apple, and smoked bacon. She liked it as well. The sweet potato chips were very good too. will be back for sure.",1
"Ok here is the deal with Red Devil Pizza.  The key to making pizza with crispy crust is to have ovens that great sufficiently hot.  That is why I like places with brick over pizza's. They don't use Brick Ovens at Red Devil but  I have been told that Red Devil has some really old pizza ovens that are not available any longer or hard to get.  I can't verify that, I don't even remember who told me that, maybe I read it some where.  Don't know if it is true or not. What I do know is that Red Devil is one of my favorite pizza place in the Valley.  Their pizza is consistently good.  Thin-Crisp and delicious.  I have had pasta's and salads there as well. They are fine, nothing to get excited about. But the Pizza at Red Devil is something I will stake my reputation on.  Actually I don't really have a reputation, but if I did I would lay it on the line for Red Devil Pizza. The long and short of it is, I am very passionate about their Pizza.  Period.",1
"Thai, Vietnamese a nice patio, good happy hour and a swanky inside they have it all.

Despite being a nicer place as Asian food goes the prices are quite reasonable and it is really a great value. 

The happy hour menu has Asian tappas (apps) for $5 and many $5 cocktails and glasses of wine. WE had the salmon satay which was just grilled cubes of salmon on a stick with sauce and some salad, good but nothing special. The veggie wontons were great in a brown sauce and filled with veggies and again a small salad garnish.

My cocktail was great but it was a bit strong.

For our mains we had the Salmon with green curry, It came in a HUGE Bowl it was rich and full of great veggies and fresh not overcooked fish. $12.95

We also had the dragon noodles, which was veggies tofu and glass noodles. It was light and fresh. ~10

Over all great quality value and patio I will be back.",1
"They had Kool Aid! i was so happy to see it :)

The chicken and waffles were really good... my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport, before going to our hotel, and it was completely worth it... 

yeah, waiting outside in 100 degree heat isn't ideal, but for 10 minutes you can deal with it... especially when they had someone outside giving out water

If you're ever in Phoenix like us, or live out there, definitely stop in!!!",1
"First time impressions are the most important and Culinary Dropout made an ever lasting one. Everything from the service to the food was spot on perfect. The whole experience was so good that it's hard to believe it will be the same when I go back. 

I hope it is............",1
I booked this resort through Priceline like so many other reviewers. I had seen this resort from Scottsdale road many times and always thought I would like to stay there sometime. Now I am so glad I finally got the chance. We stayed for 2 nights over memorial day weekend. Upon check in I was asked if I would like to up grade to a king suite for $20 more a night. I said sounds good to me. I figured it couldn't hurt for as cheep as I got the room through Priceline. I cant say enough about how well we were treated at this resort. Some of the other reviews said that this resort didn't have a resort feel. In my experience nothing could be further from the truth. I was treated better here than I have been at many 5 star resorts that I have stayed at in the past. Our suite was part of a 4 plex of suites and while the decor was a little dated it was very plush and comfortable in every way from the couches to the king size bed. The bathroom was very clean as was the entire room. The ground around the entire resort were impeccable. There are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall. The jacuzzi tubs were all very warm and in working order. We didn't order room service but I did browse through the menu and the prices were really reasonable. Everyone we met that worked at the resort was extremely friendly with the exception of one bartender at the poolside cabana bar. Overall I would have rated the entire experience with 5 stars the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of our experience at the poolside cabana. On Saturday afternoon we walked down to the poolside bar area to have a drink and we sat at a table near the bar. We were ignored by the bartender for over 15 minutes while he talked to some young girl in a bikini who was already done getting her drinks. When we were finally acknowledged we asked him if he knew how to make a certain drink he quickly replied no what else do you want in a very rude manner. We each ordered some Orange drink that was on special and it was terrible. So I am taking a half star for that experience and a half star for the extremely high price of wi-fi. It would have cost nearly $13.00 a day so we decided to pass. Thank God for our smart phones. Overall we really loved our weekend at this resort and would definitely return  especially for the great price we got through Priceline although I never did get a chance to see a regular room and I wonder if our experience would have been as good if we hadn't upgraded to the suite.,1
"I am a bonafide book junkie. Libraries are my mecca. But, I'm picky. 

Getting a SPL card was a cinch. I only needed one proof of residence, although I brought the recommended three, including a Netflix envelope. 

Once I had my card, I was ready to explore. I headed first to the public computers that help you locate books... yes! With scraps of papers and mini-pencils handy, I was good to go, once I had selected a couple books to hunt down. 

So far, so good.

But then the library got tricky. Running out of the alphabet before I had found my book. Turning into another section - from Fiction to Large Print. WTF? I decided to turn this hunt into more of a tour, so I wandered the aisles, studied the names of sections and eventually re-acquainted myself with the library system. 

Don't get me wrong. This isn't rocket science. It's also not pop rocks. 

Having found my books and a couple DVDs, I proceeded to check out. Super easy, too. I can renew online? Bonus!

My first trip to the library was GREAT. 

Then the second one came. The library had NONE of the books I came looking for, and I was prepared to find AT LEAST ONE of the books on my list of 5. Nope. So I put some ""on hold"" for me and wandered about, very disappointed. That's when I began to dislike this library. None of my books? Really? 

This library isn't browsing-friendly like others I have seen. Even the ol' library in Stillwater, Oklahoma was more comfortable than this one. In fact, I miss that ol' library, with its shelves of poetry, psychology, magazines and literature... so easy to find, so easy to browse, so easy to sit for hours and read. 

I couldn't leave SPL fast enough. On my way out, a man working (volunteering?) there showed me how to use the self-service check-out system. Nice! He was a friendly ol' man, who assumed I knew NOTHING about self-service machines... and probably doubted my ability to read, for he explained step-by-step what I needed to do in order to check out my books. At least the lesson was in-depth enough for me to fully comprehend - and then some. 

So, the next time I went to SPL - to pick up the books I had put on hold (score!) - I used the self-service check-out. I was in and out in like 7.46 minutes. 

So, let's recap:
*SLP has books!
*SLP doesn't always have the books you want. (Sad face)
*You can renew online, create a profile and share reviews. 
*You can place books on-hold from any computer, if you're logged into your account.
*People working there are friendly.
*It's easy to get a card. Just bring in your SRP bill, like I did. 
*It's not an easy place to browse.
*SPL doesn't make you feel like you want to spend hours there.
*There are private rooms; just not sure how you reserve them.
*There are monthly activities at the library - but mostly about old-fart diets and how to use Microsoft Word. 
*There's FREE parking in THE SHADE! 
*You can check your items out yourself, with their self-service check-out machine. 
*It's pretty ugly inside - brown, biege, dull and lifeless.",0
"best place in scottsdale to watch a game. Great food (greasy, but what bar food isn't?), great drink specials, and an even better atmosphere. The owner came by and greeted us and made us feel very welcome. I will definitely return in the future.",1
"I was working in Phoenix and was told that I had to try Delux, as they had the best burger and sweet potato fries I would ever have.  The fries were pretty good, but I don't think they were anything above average.  The burger, though, I thought left a lot to be desired.  It was juicy, but I would actually call it more grease-laden than truly juicy.  I like a moist burger, but I don't want grease dripping off the bun.  That was my major problem.  That may be what some people like, but I didn't.",0
"I thought I was really in for one of the best burgers of my life due to my fellow Yelpers' reviews but was sort of disappointed.  I did like the fries in the shopping cart, that was pretty creative, but they weren't anything special.  Same way I felt about the Delux burger.  The meat was dry and the condiments were lacking which made it worse.  I thiknk the bun was the best part.  I did do a cool beer flight which was nice.  The atmosphere is pretty neat here but I probably won't visit again if I'm in the area.",0
"There are other places in town that are less expensive with better sushi choices, and not as loud, but I had an experience today that inspired me to write here this evening. 

I go to Ra (Scottsdale Rd) somewhat frequently for their lunch special which is a good deal: miso soup, yummy salad with addictive ginger dressing, a california roll and four pieces of nigiri. Good stuff. I usually upgrade to a rainbow roll and just pay the difference. 

A few months ago I went to a different sushi place in Tempe. I paid with cash and when my change was returned, the server had ""rounded up"" and treated himself to a presumptuous tip (he didn't return my coins). I called the manager over, went home and wrote a bad review on Yelp, tell people not to go to that restaurant and won't return to eat there again.

This afternoon I sat at the sushi bar, had excellent service, good happy hour eats, and good discussion with the young sushi chef. I paid with cash and my Ra server gave me back my change ... minus coins. I immediately got tense and thought ""great, here we go again."" I called her over to explain. She said that she had rounded-up - in my favor. I counted my bills and saw that she had indeed given me back my change plus a little extra. She said that she didn't have coins, so she just gave me the difference. 

I thought that was very cool. I thanked her, and left a big tip.
Now I'm writing about my good experience at Ra Sushi on Scottsdale Road and will definitely keep going there. 

It's amazing how one little gesture will have such ripples.",1
"Yummy!
Worth the wait. Yes, it is all the hype so get a drink, enjoy the scenery and munch on some fabulous pizza. Not one thing I wouldn't order. Have fun and have a slice for me!",1
The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress,1
"Met some friends here for happy hour the other day.  This is the old El Paso BBQ and they did a knockout job with the remodel. Great feel and warm colors to the place now.

I had a couple of Coronas and some chips and guacamole.  The regular menu looks better than the happy hour menu and think I'll try them the next time for lunch or dinner.",0
"Unfortunately, my birthday always falls right around Mother's Day.  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in.

So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.  

The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are true professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.

Yes, it's a little pricey, but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go.

Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity.",1
Food was really good. Waitstaff were all really friendly and helpful in selecting drinks and entree. Would for sure go back.,1
My goodness this place has gone downhill. Yeesh.,0
One of my favorite places to eat if I'm looking for cheap and fast :),1
Hubby and I have lived less than 5 miles from this place for over 20 years and never stopped in.  Looking for good Chinese so yelped the area and Dragon Palace popped up with good reviews.  Comments about the outside are right - little corner spot in dated strip mall but who cares if the food is good....and it was!  We ordered three lunches to try out different dishes.  Both of us loved the egg rolls along with the sweet n sour chicken and the house chicken.  Not as thrilled with the beef and brocolli - nothing special on that dish so will stick with the chicken next time....and there will be a next time!  Don't be fooled by the outside - step in and try the food - you'll be back.,1
"Okay...I have been going here for a while and I love the place and the food!  I am surprise it hasn't had as many reviews as it should.  The truth is I come back to support local businesses in my neighborhood...I would come here anyday than go to a Fast Food burger joint..

The trailor that the restaurant is in is the cutest thing you will ever see...straight out of a 50's picture!  Its small but fitting...

The food is very fresh..I love their cheeseburgers and hotdogs..I sometimes even get some of their mango salsa/chutney on the side..they get it from this lady that homemakes it..
Not the cleanliness place but I guess thats what makes it tastes so great!!:)  Its the extra grease...I know that just sounds horrible, but true!

Anyways, support locals and their businesses...go go go!!!",1
"Returned here after a year's absense. I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details",0
"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food.  Dined with a large group so we had a set menu. I requested no butter with my crab stuffed chicken breast but they served it on the side just in case I felt the chicken was too dry.  It was de-lish!",0
"Empty tables. Told 15 minute wait. Ok. 5 minutes into wait (by the door, bumping elbows with counter patrons), 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes. We left at that point",0
"I went to this place after seeing a segment on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (Food Network).  I thought that the fusion of Chinese & Mexican food would be good.  I was a bit disapointed.  The food was okay, but nothing too special.  The establishment itself was clean and the service was quick, so kudos to them for that.",0
"Hubbard Family Swim School has become a staple for our family. You can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit. Our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson. We even have birthday parties here!

The instruction is top-notch and it's evident while watching through the huge glass wall.

Most of all, my 5 year old is a much better swimmer than I am, his father. Thanks to Hubbard.",1
"I love the artwork.  Its a tiny little restaurant crammed with a bunch of little tables and chairs.  You go up to order at the counter, there's a salsa bar in the corner with a LOT of different salsas (most are not that great).  They do bring you the food and you do get a basket of chips on the house.  The tacos are pretty heft - about 3 bucks each.  They are ""Gourmet tacos"" after all..  

All in all, its kind of uncomfortable service/restaurant wise (self serve) but the tacos are very good and you do get chips and a variety of salsas.  Not the most friendly staff and the cost is kind of high for a place like this but its pretty dang good.  Get it to go if you don't mind packing a bunch of salsa cups.",1
Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea. Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime.,1
"Everything about Coronado Cafe is charming and scrumptious.  It's my go-to place when I want to have a nice, but not fussy, lunch with a friend.  The menu has a lot of variety but not so much that it's overwhelming.  I've never been disappointed by the food.  The raspberry iced tea is delicious too! I like that they don't have any fried food, though my male friends don't so much appreciate that as they prefer fries with their burgers.  

Conversations can be challenging when dining inside-- the acoustics in an old house aren't the best to begin with, and then you cram it full of people and it gets a little noisy.  If you can't tune it out, the patio is a really lovely alternative. 

All in all, you really can't go wrong here!",1
"This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good.",1
The food wasn't phenomenal but it was very good. The service was excellent. The decor was very cool. A good experience. Great selection of wines by the glass. Very pleasant experience.,1
"I've lived near Old Town Scottsdale for years and in all that time I've never really taken to the streets by foot, aside from a weekly visit to the Farmers Market. At first glance you ask yourself how many Indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain? Well the answer is, the turquoise market in Old Town seems to be doing quite well. So it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon David's Hamburger's and Mexican Food. So for me the idea of killer burger and tasty Mexican good is a match made in heaven, were talking major food groups here. 

Tucked between 2 galleries, David's is a blink and you'll miss it kind of place, very unassuming and humble. Inside you won't be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable. With TV's at both ends of the hall like space, you'll be entertained by performance videos of 50's era rock 'n roll. 

I usually don't write much about soda pop, well never, but in this case the Cherry Coke ($1.95) was kind of special. When you order a Coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry. David's version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal. 

Of all the ways Mexican style meat is prepared, the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite. If you enjoy this as much as I do then Id suggest the Carne Asada Nachos ($8.59). A massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. While basic, I ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate. If you'd like salsa on your chips, be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa. 

Now who doesn't like a big juicy hamburger? David's doesn't disappoint with David's Single ($5.99), say that 2 times fast. A 1/3lb patty topped with the usual suspects, then dressed with David's creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of Thousand Isle dressing, adding a layer of tangy goodness. Along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade ($.99) to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden French fries. For dipping I a side of David's sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup. 

The Patty Melt ($7.25) is classic diner food. We're talking thick ground beef patty, melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread. The wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture, for me this is what a patty melt is all about. Of course the Guacamole Burger ($6.25) with its pepper jack cheese, bacon and guacamole is the marriage of Mexican and American influence. 

If you're an early riser, David's also serves breakfast like Bacon Pancakes ($6.75) and Coconut Waffles ($6.25). Someone please pass the syrup. My only question, where is the breakfast burrito?",0
"This is a great Radio Shack.  The staff are older, and very knowledgeable with their product line.  If you need odd batteries, check this store out first.  I needed a watch battery, and found that they were the only store in Phoenix to carry it.  It cost be all of $5 bucks, but saved me having to buy a new watch.",1
"These guys are still delivering consistenly good, fresh food.  It's a great little neighborhood place, good food, friendly owners.  Just a really good place to go for a nice meal out - nothing fancy.  Clean restrooms - always.

Good limoncello after dinner - always a hit!",1
Was an interesting way to spend an hour.  Lots of displays but very dusty on the inside of the cases.  Quite and peaceful; a nice place to hang out for awhile.  I showed up about 40 minutes before closing and she didn't charge me the $2 but I donated $3 since they operate only on donations.  The table set with rocks and minerals was fun to check out.  I would go back again when I wasn't short on time and explore upstairs.,0
"Trusted as a consistent Friday HH or evening meal/get together spot for a long time. We have been a slave to the Wingless Buffalo Dip the whole time. We have been fortune enough have a great server (Mallory) most of our visits as well. She has never steered us wrong in food choices. I have had the pizzas, the sandwiches and even some special entrees. It has all been good. The Reuben sandwich is a favorite and so is the Sonoran burger. The sweet potatoes fries are always really good side. 

Now some friends have had some bad experiences with service. They have a hard time returning. It happens, esp. when it is first Friday or when the host staff is out of their minds, there is just an inconsistency there. But don't let that ruin the tone of the meal.

Awesome Patio. Parking can be a pain, but sometimes you can park close around the corner. Great mix of people, so good people watching too. Seating is tight at times, because sometimes you are seated right next to another table where you can here each others convos. Can be fun at times. Def. take all of our out of town guests here. Great HH spot.",1
"I will be very brief.......the food is fantastic,!!!!!

The service is hard to figure out though. Lots of staff but we were constantly looking for our waiter, the water guy, the plate remover guy. All seemed to be on break simultaneously. I strongly recommend eating at the bar until they get the staff better trained.",1
"I have used Todd on at least a dozen occasions. I am a property investor and I buy multiple homes. I need Todd for EVERY house I do and he is ALWAYS there for me. He even got me into my own car once. At the drop of a hat, he is there for me. His knowledge is excellent, his demeanor is fantastic and his service and workmanship is excellent. I would NEVER use another locksmith unless he was dead or out of town. In which case I would probably ask him to come home. :) Use this guy. Hes great.",1
I'm rather undecided about this place.  The hygienists are great and the staff is all very nice and accommodating.  Every time I have to have a tooth filled (yes I'm totally that person) I feel like I have to go back because something is wrong.  For example not being able to floss between any of the filled teeth because the filling hasn't been filed down correctly.  I don't feel like the dentist really listens to you either.  When I felt like I had a problem with a tooth he told me it was fine and the next time I went back he found a huge cavity in that same tooth and told me I might need a root canal on it because it was so big.  What a pain.,0
"This place has negra modelo on tap.  I would almost give them 4 stars alone for that.  The food here is incredible, very reasonably priced, and is mostly locally grown and raised.  Add in there musical taste, a mixture of latin and indie rock, and you have a place about to explode from too much hipster cred.  I mean that in a good way.  We live in the east valley, so this is a haul for us, but this is THE place we take our out of town guests.  Everyone loves it.",1
"Just like the other yogurt places for selection.

Good news they had a vegan type for those of you who care. To be honest i ended up getting that one. I am not vegan by any means, but i do love a more icy texture and less/no creaminess when i have a cold dessert. 

one negative is they are poorly staffed. Busy sunday afternoon and only one kid working there. felt bad for the poor guy. But i didn't feel bad for too long after as i mentioned to him that the mochi was bad and didn't really taste like it. He said ""yeah it's not the normal rainbow kind, but this is what i call the albino mochi""... i tried not to laugh at that comment, but yeah, normal is his ""albino"" mochi...anyways don't get the mochi here...something is soo off about it. I can't put my finger on it. It's like an oopsie child  between a marshmallow and ""albino"" mochi. LOL",0
"You know how you poke fun at people who go to a steakhouse and they order something like chicken or seafood? I'm one of those people, but this time I teamed my seafood with STEAK!

They had a prix fixe menu that carried over from their New Year's Eve dinner, but I skipped over that...

I have to say, I loved my sirloin and 5 pieces of shrimp. Shrimp was done correctly - not rubbery or charred and *gasp* it was actually de-veined. I can't tell you how I've gone to nicer restaurants and their shrimp wasn't de-veined. So that alone got a little happy dance from me.

Food was a bit on the salty side, but it didn't make me have a massive thirst craving when we left the restaurant. Server was friendly and knowledgeable, which was great!

Hubby ordered his prime rib, but they didn't have it blue which was the way he wanted it. It's all good, they still brought him out some of the rarest prime rib I've seen in a long time...

For an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped scallops. I am a firm believer of 'bacon makes everything good!' and it did. The sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful. The fresh rolls that came minutes before the entree was served were my favorite kind - light and fluffy on the inside while the outer layer had enough crunch that satisfied me, yet didn't make me feel like I was about to chip any teeth. ;)

I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes!",1
"My husband's former employer said when we get to Phoenix we must go to In-N-Out. He said the last time he had one there was a line out the door. Not much of a beef burger person, we stumbled upon this burger joint as we left Ikea and decided to try it. The emergency granola bar I keep in my purse wasn't working.

There was no line out the door, who wants to wait in line anyway. We both ordered a cheeseburger (no tomato, no special sauce, no ketchup for me). It arrived in a card board container which was kinda cute and everything was hot and fresh. My burger has a thick slice of onion and several crispy lettuce leaves. The burger itself was just okay, but the freshness of the toppings won me over. My husband's had a big slice of tomato. 

Did In-N-Out live up to the hype from his former employer? Not exactly, but it came pretty close.",1
"Wow.

Been there 2 times.  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke, and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.  I'm from NW Indiana originally.  I know corn.  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.  This corn has cotija cheese, hot sauce, mayo, and I swear crack.  There has to be crack in there... I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.  I need that corn... it's just so good.  

I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn.... 

I know where I'm going tonight.",1
"The BEST of the BEST!

I agree with Daren C.  Killer Burgers, Steaks, Prime Rib and of course ribs.

Food melts in your mouth.  Make this your next restaurant stop.  You will not be disappointed.",1
"Not bad, I usually leave pretty happy and full.",0
"Pretty good place.  You never actually know who is your server because several different people actually wait on you.  The service can be slow at times which can get annoying.  The space is pretty big, bigger than what it seems from the street.  The food was so-so.",0
"My wife and I ate here last night and were extremly happy. We started with drinks at the bar, which started the night out perfectlly, then we had an appetizaer, which was a tower of cheese ( a sculpture of grilled cheese, like the hard grilled cheese on the sides of a grilled cheese sandwich). I had the tacos, they may be small, but they were packed by taste. My wife had the fish of the day, and that day it was halibut, my wife said it was the best fish she ever had. The service was great, overall a great smalll place to eat.",1
"I won't be back here.

Most cheap drive through fast food Mexican places are alike. Of course there are slight differences. In this case it wasn't for the better.

We had to drive up to the window to order. The speaker box wasn't working? What was going on there?

I ordered a chicken chimichanga with sour cream & guacamole on the side. The chimi was big, just like I expected it to be. There wasn't much guacamole. I would have liked more. They also put tomatoes in it. That's ok, I'm just mentioning it. All in all this chimi just didn't sit as well as others I've had. Maybe it was the spices they used that were different, I'm not sure.

I also ordered a large horchata. I have definitely had better. It wasn't the worst I've ever had but it needed more cinnamon flavor, that's for sure.

It's cheap, it's easy, it's fast, it's literally right down the street from me. I'd still rather make the drive over to 7th St to my fave 'bertos though. See: http://www.yelp.com/biz/rolbertos-phoenix",0
"While in Phoenix for about 36 hours, I lunched at Hooters twice. It was easily located across from my hotel and it was a weekend, which meant I could catch both the collegiate and professional football games as well as playoff baseball.
 I take Hooters for what it is, pretty decent fried food, a restaurant that caters to men, and always has a game on. This in mind, I didn't anticipate anything other then a beer and something to eat.
I sat at the bar both times and the bartender, Brittany was extremely friendly and made a point to learn (while IDing) and remember everyone's name-- which I thought was a nice touch. She was always willing to change channels to make sure everyone's game was being aired which was appreciated as well. They have a good football special-- 10 boneless wings with all you can eat fries for $5.99 during any football game.  The $3.50 25oz Shock Top beers were a deal as well. 
It was odd for me to see a kid's birthday party in the restaurant on Sunday, but to each their own.",0
"The florist manager is great, but i have not had a great experience with the night manager.  He seemed upset that i was stopping him from tidying the shelves to ask about putting an order in for flowers.  

He said he had no clue how to order flowers and could not help me. I would need to come in and speak to the Florist Manager in the morning..... Well I work and i wanted to order flowers as a surprise thats why i was there in the evening. 

thought it was odd.",0
"This was my 1st spring Training baseball experience so I can't compare the ballpark with any other. 

However, as a newbie I can say that I appreciate the intimate setting. Every seat is a decent seat. Hubs and I had seat right behind home plate for less than $30. It's a really chill atmosphere. Feels like a college ball park.

The concessions are priced fairly. The bathrooms were clean. 

I had a great time. 

See you next year!",1
"Donuts are really good, if they have any when you get there!!!  Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030, and they only had a total of 10 donuts. Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts. Very disappointed!!",0
"Only 4 stars because I have seen better. Nevertheless, AJ's is a great runner up to my personal favorite which is the  thriving local business of Portland, OR called New Seasons. If you have been to a new seasons you know that AJ's is the close primo of find food grocers.

I will one day visit the the other AJ's in town.

"Absolutely incredible. It appears the young lad who works here seems to be the go-to front-desk man everyday for this shop. He was very helpful and told me exactly what my shoes needed and didn't suggest pricier repair options that my shoes really weren't in need of! I brought in two pairs of dress shoes; one of which I had the heels replaced ($22, free shining included) and another just for shining ($8) and they made them look near-brand new again! I will certainly be bringing all of my shoes in for repairs/cleaning within the near future to this fantastic little shop!

"This place needs a face-lift, the whole concept and decor is outdated and needs some help. I think their sushi and other food items are alright, although they try to be so trendy and in reality there menu is pretty blah. Its a fun place to grab a drink and sit on the patio, but the excitement and trendiness of this place is completely gone.",0
"Sweet Potato Tater Tots..................why are you still reading?  what more needs to be said?  Yum Yum getcha some!

The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is their unwillingness to enforce rules with parents who bring kids and think everybody else wants to enjoy watching them run around the place like its a playground, its NOT - keep your kids at the table or at home.",1
"I really like this place over Pizza Hut or Dominoes because the pizza is excellent and well priced 
The pizza from here isn't gross like other pizza places/chains
it tastes authentic and freshly made
When we order pizza, we only order from here
We also get the wings usually we ask for extra sauce because if you don't they don't put much on them 
Other than that, its great
It take anywhere from 20-30 minutes for delivery for us",1
"My wife and I decided to take a little vaca to celebrate our 13th anniversary and also was the first time that we were traveling with our 5-month old, so you can imagine we were a little apprehensive. 

The resort is absolutely top-notch, the rooms are very spacious, the staff is very courteous, and the facilities are simply superb.  Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe. 

The rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one.  The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone.  The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me. 

So then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour.  The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasn't going to happen.  I've traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever. 

Still, a great place to stay, the facilities are top-notch, the staff is very nice, and we had a wonderful time.  Would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing, fun experience in the Valley of the Sun.  Cheers.",1
Sara (bartender) is the hottest chick in the world!!,1
"I'm working downtown now (new themed list to come soon!) so I'm exploring the area from a different angle. I'm no stranger to downtown/midtown's happy hour and dinner spots, but I've never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day. 

I checked out Focaccia one morning when I hadn't had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband, Myles M, who works right around the corner. He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because he's pushy and I always do what I'm told. Ok, neither of things are true, but in this case, he had conviction and I obediently complied. 

The breakfast burrito was worth every penny. Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick. 

The hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, I'll just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office. God knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to Focaccia.",1
"I can not believe that pizza could be this good. I had good pizza on a recent trip to NY, and this really is the closest that I can find to the pizza out there.

They say that its the water, but I am skeptical of that. I guess it doesn't matter what they did to make the pizza, it was really, really good.",1
"I can't believe we get to review a free publication.  Nonetheless, it's important to know (especially for Dave B., who obviously didn't do his research) that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great, creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine.  He decided this 17 years ago, and, despite pretty much breaking even (it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no, the ads do not cover the full cost), continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness.  Notice that the photoshoots use local designers, local models, local photographers, and local locations.  The articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries, businesses (like restaurants) and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means, and about up-and-coming events like the taco festival (started by a local), fashion shows (again, utilizing local designers and run by locals - no Dillard's show coverage here) and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community.  If the magazine doesn't seem critical enough, it's because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about, and therefore don't have to waste pages with hateful criticism when Java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer.  When it's run by a local, written by locals, and put together in the publisher's dining room, I can't think of any magazine with MORE credibiilty and freedom.  The publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is.  That's why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the Crescent Ballroom.  That's also why you'll read the backstory on five locally owned, little-known coffee houses at far ends of the valley.  The candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasn't been written about, or to local artists, designers or patrons of the arts.  While it's always interesting to hear what people think of Java, knowing what really goes on behind the scenes gives me nothing but respect for the handful of folks to who put their blood sweat and tears into creating this free publication each month.",1
"Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Everything here is disposable, from the furniture to the linens to silverware. (Silverware rusted after one cycle in the dishwasher!).  So if you like to redecorate often and have a minimal budget this place is for you. 

As far as their food, I've only had a cinnamon roll here and it was stale. Bummer.

My biggest annoyance here are the people who seem to be beached out on all the couches/beds/chairs. Don't you have homes?",0
"First of all, I have to give Dos at least three stars just because it's Dos. I mean did going to Dos make me feel old, yes, were there some interesting people there and not in a good way, yes, did I spend more money than I wanted to, yes, but all in all you always have a great time. Nothin' but laughs. The giant jenga didn't suck either. 

Dos Gringos is a staple among the youngins, as I like to call 'em. In college, one will totally fit in, however, now'a days it's a place meant solely for people watching. And boy do you get an eye full.

"WOW!  I am very sorry that it took me so long to convince Bri D. to go here.  We went for brunch and it was amazing.  Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.  The johnny cakes were out of this world!  They have a granola-y taste to them, are filled with blueberries, and topped with yogurt and real maple syrup.  It is this awesome combo of sweet and tart that is great.  Despite being three pancakes, they weren't heavy and dense like normal ones.  They made me feel satisfied but not ""stuffed"" and gave me lots of energy throughout the day.  That's exactly what the awesome waitress said they would do.

"This place has been my weakness since childhood. I still get food from here once a month or so. Probably the only fast food place I visit often, other than Five Guys when I lived on the east coast. If you're preparing for a trip to Mexico, just dine here once a week for a month or two before your vacation. You'll probably be introduced to much of the bacteria of delicious real-Mexican street food.

Perhaps it's not that bad, but it is delicious. Especially their ""pastrami dog"". You can be a self-proclaimed ""foodie"" all you want, with your ""oh, ha! ha!, but I admit that I do on the occasion dine at the selected In-N-Out"" pompous asshole who thinks you're still down-to-earth, or you can come down and gorge on some real disgusting, real fast food. What are you afraid of? Your arteries will expand enough to still allow the blood  through, don't worry. Sure, they may drop your hot dog on the ground and forget to use sanitary gloves from time to time, but how else are you going to break in your immune system, you sissy?",1

"As a frequent antiques consumer, I can honestly say that Lizabel's Treasures is my favorite antique store in Phoenix. I've been a customer for several years, and Lizabel's is my first (and often only) stop.

Why Lizabel's is such a treasure is because of these things: price, desirable antiques, and great customer service. John and Bette know what people want, and they go to great lengths to get the antiques that people want and to make their customers happy. I'm a believer.

They consistently have one-of-a-kind quality furniture and pieces that you would not normally find elsewhere in town. Pieces are priced very agreeably, so you can afford to stock up or furnish a whole room without busting the bank.

John and Bette have created the kind of family business that is to be admired. They have a legion of supportive customers, and I'm one of them. I can always find them to be helpful and interested in getting me what I want, even if I don't always know what I want.

Lisabel's Treasures is the place to build a relationship with, because as one's life's needs changes, so does the need for different pieces and furniture. I can always count on finding something I really love at their store, and you will, too.",1

I have ordered here before (General's chicken) and beef and broccoli but tonight we had the worst lo mein and coconut shrimp we ever had.  The lo mein was so bland and the coconut shrimp breading was so thick and untasty. I cannot even identify what type of breading they used.  it actually ruined the sauce - i would have rather ate the sauce alone with a spoon.  We didn't even save the leftovers.  I won't not order from her again but will make note of these two items.  DO NOT ORDER them.,0

"I love burgers and really wanted to love The Grind, but it wasn't meant to be. Unfortunately I had problems with the temperatures, both the restaurant and the food.

I was here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night. The restaurant itself is nicely appointed, with a sleek, modern look and feel. It was pretty close to full, but staff were still friendly and efficient. 

The $5/glass wine special they were running was very nice. I has the peppercorn burger with sweet potato fritters. The fritters were very nice, crunch without being greasy, and not overly sweet. The burger was nicely composed with great toppings and flavors - the watercress in particular stood out. Unfortunately, the burger was also well, well done, and I had ordered medium. I should have sent it back, but was hungry and didn't want to wait. For a burger joint missing a temperature on a burger is pretty disappointing and it killed a lot of the goodwill the rest of the ingredients had built up. 

The bread pudding for desert wasn't the best I've ever had, but was nice and the bourbon sauce it came with was a nice touch. 

The other issue I had with The Grind is the temp inside the restaurant. I'll grant that these are the dog days of summer right now, and I'm sure it's hard to keep the place cool with the half open kitchen, but was pretty warm in there.

With the wine special it was ok value for the money I guess. But on a normal night with $10-12/glass for wine and $10 for a burger with another $4 for fries it's too pricey for my tastes, especially if they aren't hitting proper temps on the burgers every time.",0
"I really wanted to like this place.  For starters, I paid cash for my take out. I was owed back five dollars and was told "" we don't have enough change"". So I had to settle for $2.50. What kind of restaurant doesn't have proper change?  Especially on a Saturday night.  
     The food:  Chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste. Gave up on them after a few bites.  Vegetable chow mein:  In my opinion, a broun sauce is thick and flavorful. This one was very liquidy and flavorless.  Dumplings were edible at best.

"BEST CARNE ASADA (GRILLED SLICED STEAK), HACIENDA-STYLE HOSPITALITY. A MEXICAN FOOD EXPERIENCE IN THE THEME-PARK STYLE.

--colorful, tasteful, vibrant ambiance in the country-hacienda style; kudos to the designers with an eye for detail;
--dining room draws natural light from the delightful patio windows to the vaulted ceilings above;
--this place and the adjacent ranch market are a ""must-do"" for tourists (bring your out-of-towners here);

--Don't miss the Parrilla (grilled platter); one ""portion"" serves two; choose three meats and voice your tortilla preference;
--grilled vegetables include nopales (cactus), Mexican zucchini squash, jalapenos (consumed whole, took me to five hiccups before my stomach settled), and baby onion stalks (not the typical pile-o-fajita yellows);
--both rice and beans served family style, and perfectly flavored. I could just sit and eat bowl after bowl of those beans;
--juicy, perfectly cooked shrimp; ""asada"" goodness knows no bounds;
--guacamole is plentiful (no melon-ball scoops of yesterday at $3/ea here!) and freshly made to order; NOW THAT'S what I'm TALKing about !!!
--table salsa is spicy with lots of freshly chopped chilis and pureed onions; really good burn;
--try the horchata (rice milk and cinnamon sugary goodness) or any of the featured Aguas Frescas.
--no fuss over separate checks (and that was for our table of 10!)

--pork was a bit dry; is ""gamey"" possible in pork?
--server forgot our desserts and we gave up after 20 minutes (shucks! they were sitting right there on the pass!); the manager refunded us promptly and then packaged them to-go.

After so many recent disappointments on rock-hard rubbery shrimp, I _finally_ found a place that grills properly, excellent marinade, and with the freshest ingredients. If you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands, you are correct: several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas, cheese, asada, aguas and more!

If you don't have a filthy-rich Mexican relative with a hacienda (Mexican mansion) across the border, this may be the closest you'll get without an invitation. The mostly-abandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain, lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market, bodas, or other festival. In the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala, the grand room.

Don't miss the Ranch Market next door; you won't see retail food sold in this quantity anywhere else in town. Take your camera.",1
"The pizza is just OK. Pretty crowded at lunch time and seating is a nightmare. Get the lunch special, you get a personal pizza slicer and a pan. Would get it to go if I didn't live in the west valley. Good idea to have a separate take out door but don't count on this place to be acceptable for those of us with disabilities to get around.",0
I was so excited to visit The new Postino in Gilbert!!! I love and frequent the original but this new location is much closer to my house. Bruschetta is amazing!!! Love the atmosphere and staff too. Wine selection rocks!!! Great Happy hour prices!!! Highly recommend a visit!,1
"As someone who LOVES Thai food, I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai, and Wild Thaiger's is my favorite hands down!

Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.

Their other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.

Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.

The service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.

One day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.  Highly recommended!",1
Not only was the music the worst I have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever! Like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music. Food was so so but over priced for what it was.,0
"The pool area was very nice.  Every chair had a towel on it ready for you.  The pool service was great.  Greg Badger is the most hard-working waiter there.  He was out in the sun in upper 90/lower 100 degree temperatures and was very helpful to all the guests.  I ate at Elements the other times I visited Arizona, but the poolside menu is great too! I preferred the orange chicken bento box.  Although edamame was not on the poolside menu, our waiter was able to get it for us.  That is great service!

The bed was very comfortable; nice and soft.  I also liked the wall-mounted, flatscreen LCD tv.The valet service was great as well.  We were greeted everytime we drove into the Sanctuary complex.  

The tennis courts were very nice as well.  I played during the morning and made use of their ball machine to warm up.",1
"Great Mexican food. 
Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes. 
Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada
Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.",1
"I've seen this place come up on Yelp a lot, especially since it's near where I work, and finally had a chance to take Jon S. out for a sort of going away dinner the other night. I thought to make reservations, which was a good idea because it was very packed on a Friday night. We started with the taste of thai, which is their version of a pupu platter. My favorites were the thai toast and chicken satay. It was a little weird that the fried items were hot, but the pot stickers and siamese kisses were a little warm, but still good. I had the crispy basil chicken (level 3 hot) and Jon had the shrimp stirfry (level 1 hot). When our dishes were brought out, we both loved the flavors, but agreed we needed some more heat, and our server gladly brought out some chili paste for us which did the job. 

It's a very cute restaurant and I'll definitely be back to try some other things on the menu.",1
I really like this place alot. their pizza's are really different but really good! I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection! Major thumbs up!!,1
"Go for the food and you won't be disappointed, great middle eastern dishes served up nice and generously whether you get it to go or for dining in.  I went here and ate in and there was initially no one in the restaurant but me and then it quickly filled up with people. So I know that this is a neighborhood spot. The gyros and tzatziki sauce are very good but so is the hummus, falafel, kibbi and shwarma.",1
"Took my family here for dinner.  The hamburgers were really good.  I had the regular charburger, and i liked it quite a bit.  It was better than most of the fast food chains, but I'd rank it below the higher end burgers from places like Fuddruckers or Red Robin.   For the price though, I was very satisfied.  My 8 year old really liked her charburger with cheese, but my other daughters did not like the grilled cheese at all.  I was not impressed by either the regular or sweet potato fries, but the onion rings were good.  We did not get any dessert, although the sundaes and milk shakes looked really appealing.  We'll try those next time.",0
"Best pizza in the valley that I've had (I've yet to do Pizzaria Banco).  Great service, always made fast, and GREAT pricing...doens't travel well, so if you're gonna have it in your car for a while I wouldn't recommend it...I think that's why there's a lot of ""soggy crust"" comments etc...",1
"Why Meh? 
 
The state of repair on the games made this a voyage of discovery, e.g, with a 2 hour unlimited card I could work out which machines actually worked:)

"I love Cheuvronts and have been going there regularly for years. Why only three stars then? Over the past year and a half the service has gone downhill. I find that the servers are impersonal and rigid, and sometimes a little pompous. After three or four bad experiences in a row I just don't go there anymore. They do have great cheese plates and a fantastic happy hour...just don't catch them when they have a special event going on.",0
"Neat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This place is like a trip to a non-petting zoo and aquarium and aviary while you dine on fairly decent Mexican food.  I was here for a late brunch and didn't wait at all.  I was near a window that right on the pond, and just about every turtle in the pond crawled out to come on over and see what the Rock was cooking and how I was enjoying it... no joke, see pic!

The ducks and geese were very active in the lagoon, showing off for all the diners, and it thrilled the kids to pieces.  The guacamole is decent and the 3 types of salsa you're given were all good in their own ways.  

If anything, swing in here for the atmosphere.  I bet its awesome at night.",1
"As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale, I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball player---who happens to be my nephew. We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food. 

Michael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small, but excellent Scottsdale Quarter. (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.) The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse. The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers. Very opulent without being ostentatious!. 

We both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving. 

We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie's ordered. (I'll go back during baseball season :-) ) 

After ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as ""cajun-style, but not overwhelming"". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce. 

The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table. We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert. 

Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.

One comment: The ""Branding"" of the restaurant is confusing. Either call it ""Dominick's"" or ""Lincoln Avenue"", but not both. This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty you'd want to keep and associate. (Qualifier: I'm not a branding expert and this is strictly my opinion.)

 I would love to see Mastro's try a southwest cuisine spot!",1
"Decent wash, generally pretty quick. Used to be Octopus Car Wash. Has lube and detail center, although I have never used that service. 

One of the better wash places- way better than Danny's for sure..",1
"The rap on Starbucks is that they ""over-roast"" or ""incinerate"" their beans.

And I think that might be right...sometimes at Starbucks, it seems like I'm drinking something brewed from charcoal briquettes...it doesn't taste good:(

Now, I will tell you that I am really no connoisseur of coffees...I like coffee, you know...a good dark roast, made with freshly roasted beans:)

But the beans don't have to come from a specific plant , grown on the southern side of a special hill in Columbia and then eaten and pooped out by a badger of some sort.

No, I just want a decent cup of coffee at a decent price:)

Why can't Starbucks do that?

I occasionally need to meet someone for business, and Starbucks comes up as meeting place (and I understand that...they are almost annoyingly ubiquitous:)

I have sat at a cafe table on a street corner in San Francisco, having a cup of coffee at a Starbucks...looking at the Starbucks across the street...Lewis Black calls it ""the place where space and time folds in on itself""...I say ""why build the Hadron Super Collider to open a black hole?""...Starbucks did it a decade ago with a combination of charred coffee beans and vats of money to open a Starbucks for every adult in the United States:)

In and of itself, that's no reason for a 2 star review...Gordon Gecko said it best...""Greed is Good!"" and Starbucks exemplifies that credo...they are a generally very successful corporation grown up from the Bay area defectors from Peet's Coffee...I have no problem with success:)

No, my gripe with Starbucks is that they seem to be all about the marketing and not about the product...their coffee is crap:) So is most of the stuff they serve...it's second or third rate, at best.

And just because it's convenient doesn't mean we all need to stop in.

There is better coffee and better tea and better everything around...at much better prices...it's worth looking for another meeting spot:)",0
"I was going to take the time to write a scathing review, but I honestly can't even bring myself to do it. 1 star. That's all I can say.",0
"I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong. Not cheap. I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 ""designer brand"" surcharge (no, I am not kidding). Despite branding as ""green"" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green, silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience). No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area. Be warned!",0
"If you appreciate a good dive bar, you will love this place!  We came here for the first time when our team was playing in Glendale.  Dos Gringos played host to all BCS fans and it was a blast.  They have giant Jenga, dancing, multiple levels & bars and a great outdoor space. The facilities are a little beat, definitely a place where you don't want to touch anything in the bathroom, at least when it is packed.   The bar staff does a good job of managing the crowd and I never felt like I was wasting time begging for them to ask me what I wanted.

We returned for a bachelorette party and although we still had a good time, I think this place really thrives when you are with a huge group.  Food is decent, but not why you come here.",1
"My wife and I visited LGO a while back and we were both impressed and enjoyed our meal. The WINGS were by far the best I have ever tasted. Our pizza was great, we had the pepperoni and ricotta. It does get kinda crowded and chaotic on weekend nights. The grocery store in pretty cool but didn't buy anything. Like a previous review, it did feel like a upscale Cracker Barrel. All around a great place to eat. Also, Take a camera so you can take pictures of all the lame hipster clowns that try to make it all about them. They are the only downside to LGO.",1
"I moved in here a few ago and I do like it for the most part. The grounds are kept clean and tidy, except for some irresponsible pet owners. Some of them even let their pets run around leash-less or cannot control them. But that is not the management's issue.

Pros:
1. The apts are spacious, well-built.
2. Grounds are clean and grass is maintained.
3. Pool is well-maintained.
4. Online system for rent pay and maintenance tickets is great.
5. Price is great for the value.

Cons:
1. Apts not sound-proof or heat-proof.
2. Sprinklers tend to sprinkle more water over the sidewalks than the grass area.
3. Covered parking is extra $$$ and not enough of them anyways.
4. Uncovered spots are all just crowded in the parking lot at the back.
5. Security gates are open most of the time from the front and have gaps that could let an adult through on the sides.
6. Outer compound Walls are not high enough to actually prevent/make it difficult for an intruder.
7. Fitness center is adequate at best. Most of the free weights and equipment (except the machines) are broken or missing. The machines work ok, but are not maintained well.
8. Leasing office employees could use a bit more smile and inter-personal skills.",0
"Whenever I start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is, I remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon at Durant's. And the hot fudge sundae for dessert? Dang, just can't beat it. The bartenders are old school--not too aloof, not fawning, just professional and classy. The best.",1
"Try as I might I cannot give this place a thumbs-up. I've likely been in D&E 30 times over the last 10 years, always wanting to 'give them another chance'. They are close-by and the food is above average. But the service ALWAYS sucks. I seriously wonder if the servers are TRAINED to ignore customers. I'm not referring to when it is BUSY, I'm talking weeknights with a very light crowd. They all must be independently wealthy, is the only thing I can guess.",0
"dropped by for lunch with 90yr old and 2 yr old plus hubby. all in all very good. hubby had sausage samich w/fries he really enjoyed it. baby had spaghetti and meatball she ate real good which means it was real good. mom had catfish w/spaghetti and marinara, she ate more than half and the rest went home with her. i had chicken marsala w/marinara on ziti. i subbed the wedding soup for the salad. the service was very quick and attentive. the lamb appetizer was just right with the bread. everything was tasty and very nice presentation. will be back soon, very convenient, very reasonable prices plus a full bar for happy hour.
pizza looked very promising, too. take out may also be in my future relationship with lil deemo's.",1
"Mmmmm, Mmmmmm, Great food.  The popcorn shrimp here are to die for-they leave a wonderful lasting impression.  So does their desert plate...The service was wonderful and quick and attending to us.  Also, we had been lounging at the pool all day and were not looking so sharp but they didn't seem to have a dress code or anything as they were more than welcoming.  It is a bit pricey but i'm not sure you can expect anything less when going to a W Hotel.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants a more chic sushi experience, cool atmosphere, doesn't mind paying the extra dollar and enjoys tasty food.",1
"Let me preface this review ..I have lived in this area for 15 years and Chompie's has been the only option for good Jewish deli. In my 51 years I have never received worse service than from Chompie's They ALWAYS get the order wrong., Tonight after much debate I caved for my daughter who has strep throat. She wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better. So reluctantly I called in for take out at Chompies. I assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup. I returned home and called my daughter in to tell her I got what the doctor ordered. As I watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient......... THE SOUP!!!!!  When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order. This was more than screwing up a order. This was forgetting the soup in SOUP. They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container. I responded I didn't think I had to ask for broth in soup! I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.  I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food. You will be highly disappointed with Chompies. This is the first time I have ever heard of yelp. My son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these. I hope you take my advice.",0
"Been here twice and enjoyed both of our experiences. The setting is pretty urban feeling for far east Mesa--grateful for that. The wine list is pretty unusual...lots of wines and grapes you've never heard of since the owner is from...Hungary? Can't remember, but the wine selection benefits from his extensive knowledge of that region. 

The fried chicken--patented, no less--was really something. Spicy and brined to fall off the bone. The pasta dishes are good as well, with portions expected in a urban restaurant (don't expect Claim Jumper portions). 

All in all a great place to sit, savor dinner and talk. Waitstaff is on a learning curve, and you benefit, since the restaurant is new and they bend over backwards, service-wise. Highly recommended!",1
For my hubby and I on a Saturday night Grimaldi's turned out to be pretty lame. The restaurant is decorated well and the hostess was friendly enough but the actual pizza was SOOOOO BORING. I seriously took a bite and wondered if I had missed the slice altogether. I will say I tasted a lot of garlic but that doesn't count for much when the pepporoni is bland and the sauce is useless. Now I'm a deep-dish girl at heart but I've had AMAZING thin slice at Classic Italian Pizza in Tempe. This place made me feel like I wasted my money and I woudn't ever want to bring anyone here including myself again!,0
Great iced tea. Terrific Roast Beef and mashed potatoes. Love the biscuits. You can't go wrong at Cracker Barrel.,1
"I love Greek food. I have no idea when I became so enamored with Greek cuisine but I am glad I did. I end up craving it at least once or twice a week so when I met the fiance for lunch today near his office I mentioned aforementioned craving and he led us here to Cyprus Grill.

The place was pleasantly busy but not overcrowded. We ordered at the counter and out food came out pretty quickly. We tried the gyro pita as well as the gyro plate. We cleared our plates in no time so I guess that means the food was good, right? 

The gyro meat was tasty, moist and flavorful. The rice was delicious and the tzatziki sauce was refreshing. We decided that we'd be going back for future lunch dates whenever possible. Besides, you can't have too many go to Greek spots in my opinion so this one's definitely going in our books. Done and Done.",1
"Orange Table is one of my go-to spots in the valley.  The food and atmosphere are superb.  The wide assortment of beverages certainly strengthens OT's menu when pairing food and drink.

I will admit that while the location may seem hard to find, there are times where I've had to wait, and wait...but if you enjoy great food then it is worth the wait.

Their salads and burgers (especially the wine burger w/ cheese and red onion) are fantastic!",1
"I'm a huge fan of Grimaldi's Pizza.  The Better Half and I stopped in here for dinner and we had a huge appetite.....which is dangerous in a Pizza joint for me.

Sundried Tomatoes - $4
Red Peppers - $4
Ricotta Cheese - $2
Mushrooms - $2
Jalapenos - $2

Yeah, all toppings are al la carte here....so it's not cheap.  The Pizza was awesome!  I enjoyed every bite.  The combination of the sweet taste of Sun Dried Tomatoes combined with the spicy kick of Jalapenos mixed in with Ricotta, Mushrooms, and Red Peppers hit the spot!

The Better Half enjoyed her Pizza too.  Since I'm on my no Meat diet, I took her word for it....as much as I was tempted to give it a try, I resisted....maybe next time.

To wash it down, she had 2 glasses of Brazin Zinfandel $8 ea, I had 2 O'douls $4 ea.  All in, the dinner was $72 before tip.

Overall, it was a nice dinner.  I finished my food, she took home 1/2 of her Pizza.

"I had an awesome experience here and highly recommend Dr. Dachs. He is here to be a good dentist, not just to get rich. His hygienist was a rock star: So nice and very gentle. I nearly fell asleep during the cleaning.

I found my way to this practice after a horrible experience at another dentist just half a mile away (see my review of Belmont Dentistry on Raintree). Dr. Dachs was just so helpful and reassuring while still maintaining a very high level of professionalism. I am very thankful that my ""second opinion"" quest led me to him. I now finally have a top-quality dentist in Scottsdale I can trust!

I definitely recommend selecting this practice. It may take a little time to get in, but it's worth it. They also work well with insurance.",1
"My wife wanted to go here a few weeks back for her birthday so we went on a Saturday afternoon.  Parking was easy to find and there was no wait to get a table.  Wish it had been a touch cooler, but it wasn't so we decided to eat indoors.  

Had a little snafu with our servers where someone who was not our waiter took our drink orders, but it was straightened out pretty quickly.  We each ordered one of the signature drinks, the wife got cucumber lemonade (I think) and I got a green arnold palmer.  I liked the g.a.p.  For the meal, don't remember what the wife had, I got the chicken sausage pizza.  It was fine, nothing out of the ordinary.  

Basically, that's how the whole meal was, okay, but didn't blow me away (not that I'm a huge healthy/organic foodie kind of guy though).  I guess I'd go here again, but I probably wouldn't suggest it.  (I did think the music was a little loud...)",0
"Sadly received this email today:

Sabatinos is Closed
You know we have been experiencing a lack of sales which we can blame on the economy, new restaurants opening here in the valley (most likely for much less cost than us original places), we tried to work with our landlord, but he would not budge on lowering our rent. We just could not afford the 5500.00 this month and were afraid we would lose everything in our place to a Lockout, which was threatened to us already.
We just wanted to say goodbye to all of our loyal customers, we really enjoyed having you come in weekly and keeping up with your lives as well as you keeping up with ours. We will probably be leaving the Az area and starting over fresh.

"I mostly buy mountian house and other camping foods from REI, they have a huge selection to choose from, including biscuits and gravy. don't expect 5 star restraunt food, but on those long days at a Military range Mountain house beats the pants off MRE's not to mention you could eat 3 mountain house meals and be about where a MRE is. I've been drooling over several other items at the store, I'd like to go backpacking sometime and they have tons of little things that could make things a little more tolerable for either Military operations, or camping/ backpacking.",1
"This review is for the bar ONLY! 

First time I came in here it was packed to this gills, and no where to sit so we left.. Next!

Second time I came here I met 2 of the strangest old women I've ever encountered who tried to reel me into a marketing scam, wouldn't shut up about how lovely I was and how both of them wanted me as their daughter, then performed Reiki on me and my friend, waving their hands all around us eyes closed and chanting.. in front of the everyone. I couldn't help but bust out in laughter. Bartender laughed too, then poured more bourbon in my glass and winked.

I really liked this place aside from the geriatric nonsense. Great vibe & I loved the entrance, you walk right through the kitchen and can observe the chefs working their magic. The interior is dark and sexy, with some of the coolest wallpaper I've ever seen.

I am hoping to write an update soon, because I desperately want to try the steak that I have heard so much about, but $60 for dinner is a little out of my budget, thanks to our economical crisis and being unemployed. *sigh*",1

Food was great but nothing to die for.",1
"Mucho Gusto es mucho mierda. 

Let me say first, that the place is cute, the staff is friendly, and the salsa is good. There. I'm not being a total jerk. 

The food, however, left much to be desired. I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok, but the meat didn't have much flavor, there was no cheese, and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico. What really got me was that they didn't come with rice and beans. Instead, I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesar-ish dressing. Sure, there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice (A slice!) on top, but come on. $14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine? For that much, they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad. Or, I dunno, sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos?

The story was much the same with the fish tacos, only the salad was different. The enchiladas seemed to be a hit, and those are served with rice and beans. the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal, and they aren't kidding about it being a side. I think my cat's food bowl is bigger. 

They charge $1 per bowl if you want more chips. I know $1 isn't a big deal, but it's just the principle. I already felt ripped off from the entree, so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse. 

Needless to say, I won't be going back. There are far better choices closer to home.",0
"I don't know why I waited so long to visit Yogurtology; it's located conveniently next to my Safeway.  Why did i wait so long?!

Yogurtology has perfected self-serve froyo.  The flavors are spot-on...lemon meringue, birthday cake, NSA coffee, peach mango tart, cheesecake, mango, rootbeer...the list goes on...I always end up getting oatmeal cookie.  It's made in-house with real oatmeal cookies.  We're talking oatmeal cookie literally IN the froyo, none of that artificial flavor crap.  It is incredible.  

Instead of having little placards for the flavors, there are digital Sony TV screens that describe each flavor and a brief nutritional run-down.  Very high-tech!

The selection of toppings is unparalleled--baklava, three different kinds of twix and milky way, brownie, chocolate chip cookie bar, chocolate covered waffle cone, premium fruit and nuts...anything you can imagine, Yogurtology has it.  

Not only that, but the shop is impeccably clean, and the staff are consistently cheerful.  This place blows Yogurtland and Yogurtopia AND all other Yogurtology locations out of the water!!!

We started with edamame and mussels.  I have never had mussels before, just oysters and clams.  The mussels were eff'in awesome.  They were not super chewy and the way they were seasoned and served, spicy and bold, was seriously amazing.

Three of us polished off three different rolls.  Spicy tuna crunch roll, over the top.  What the heck roll, another spicy roll that was seriously good as H€LL!  Screaming roll, spicy tempura style shrimp roll with a delicious crunch.  Spicy is the way to go with sushi rolls.

For dessert we went with mochi ice cream, served in four flavors: vanilla, strawberry, green tea and mango.  The green tea and mango were my favorites.

Such a good dinner, now if only they served alcohol.",1
"The place was just your typical stable, but my wife and I had a wonderful experience here. It was our first time riding, so the staff took great care to show us how to mount and maneuver the horses. We then followed a guide through an orchard for an hour's ride (just the right length of time for us as beginners). The horses were very tame, and were easy to ride. The best part of the experience, however, was our interaction with the staff. They couldn't have been more friendly and more helpful. We're excited to go back.",1
"Pretty good place.  Separate bar area upstairs with lots of TV's for sports.  Nice size portions.  A little pricey, but big portions.",1
Very tasty.  Had the pork which it typically dry but here it was really good.  The only thing is that I got bored with the flavor.  Quality of ingredients are very high.,1
"The sign also bills itself as 'Santa Fe style' food. Having lived many years in New Mexico, with a family - generations of which are from New Mexico - the cuisine was decidely not New Mexican. It was standard Sonoran.

With that said, the meal was quite enjoyable. The enchilada sauce had a nice flavor. The dulce de leche was fantastic. The service was very good. The decor was a little non-descript, but that's OK, All in all, a nice addition to the meager choices for Mexican food in Surprise.  We would probably come back.

I had to give it 3-stars because of what it is not. If you are looking for Spanish food - there is none here. If you are looking for New Mexican style-cuisine, you won't find it either. 

However, if you are looking for a decent, enjoyable meal at a local family-owned establishment, this is a good choice.",0
"If I'm rating strictly on getting what I wanted out of the visit, this doctor is fine.  He checked my eyes, did all of the tests and I walked out with my prescription.

Here is why I can't give him a good review (and this is solely based on my personality and preferences while dealing with the service industry- others may think he's wonderful...)

1)  I purposely chose an early morning (7:30 a.m.) appointment so that I would get to work by 9.  My office is less than a mile from his office and I was still running into work at 9:05 a.m.  This is due to the very long-winded soap-box like speech that Dr. Greene gave me.  I am a get-in, get-out type of person who hates small talk and hates self-promotion even more and if I heard him tell me how often he visits the gym or works out one more time, I probably would have gauged my eyes out right there to never need an optometrist again.  I also learned all about his wife, friend's boat...you name it...he told me about it (completely unsolicited).

2)  I am an educated individual who does not need an hour-long explanation- filled with graphical references and cutesy anecdotes- about why I now need progressive lenses.

3)  The fear-inducing sales pitch by the staff and the doctor was a bit much.  I realize that all optometrists and dentists are going this route now- ""buy this test (not covered by insurance) and be free from worry that you'll instantly go blind""; however, if I want something, I'll ask for it...just like any other retailer.  

Like I said...I got what I needed, a solid eye exam and prescription.  However, I purposely did not buy glasses there due to the doctor's cheesy personality and the ""hard-sell"" environment.  Again, there are obviously (based on the other posters) people who are attracted to this type of personality...I am not one of them.  

Hence, why I do most of my shopping online.",0
"I love this place.  Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.  They have a wonderful selection of beers, fantastic wines, and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there.",1
"The thing about CPK I've noticed over the years, if you want adequate service, show up when it's not busy, because when it IS busy, plan on paying full price for drinks and meals that are completely and utterly lackluster.  CPK, do me a solid, if you run out of garnish for your $7.50 sangria's, let me know. I really look forward to that soaked pineapple and cherry, thank you very much! And please, don't think of it as audacious for me to request a dollar off for your mistake. Bottom line, won't return, and won't recommend this to anyone I love or even just moderately like.",0
"I love Pizza-A-Metro and so does Joe Arpaio. I am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common.

This is where I take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while. (I kid, I kid...) I have never had anything here that I don't find super delicious and crave-worthy. The first time I went here my party was personally doted on by Maurizio, who was over-the-top gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing.  While I don't see him every time I am here, the service never suffers.

The calamari is crisp and light, which is a nice change from heavy, fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many Italian joints. Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Frescolina. The combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it!

So next time you are at Pizza-A-Metro, my advice is don't loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is Joe Arpaio. Don't look him up on your Blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners. Don't bring up that his mother died in childbirth, and how that potentially explains a great deal of the man's 'politics.' No matter how much wine you have had, do not forget how small this restaurant is. Because in the end, after he and his bodyguards leave, the server will tell you- Yeah. That was him.",1
"I came to Timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine. I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T. and I was so happy to check this place out!

I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.

They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently ""better than baba!"" 

Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!  

The staff was top notch as well. I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.

I can't wait to go back! For drinks and food! I think I'd even go alone for lunch if I didn't have any company!",1
"My husband and i went here for our 2nd wedding anniversary..We wanted to goto some place that was romantic, quiet and served gr8 food & drinks...We were so glad we came to Chritophers..The food & drinks are expenesive but you get what you pay for...The food was gr8..We ordered escagort ( snails ) , seafood and a duck dish...Tasted really good and so did the wine..I will recommend this place for special occassions..You will not be disappointed !!",1
"Surprised this place isn't closed by now. Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back.

Their ingredients are not fresh, gyro meat tastes old and decrepit. They really need to hire better pita makers who don't resemble drug addicts and derelicts. My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me. Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!",0
"This Safeway is nice and is close to my house, but after visiting this weekend I have to stay I am going to stick with Bashas. The prices are definitely higher on my normal items at Safeway. Also, I know Safeway can't really control this, but the vibe is not as friendly. The parking lot was packed, there were grumpy folks looking for spots. This is the same Safeway that my husband was at when a guy and his girlfriend walked up to him and offered him $5 to help get him a hair cut. My husband's hair wasn't even that long (maybe an inch or two). I don't know what it is that draws that type of crowd, but Bashas has a much more home-town feel.",0
"Unique place that you wouldn't stop at unless you were recommended.  Seriously, this isn't the type of place you drive by and say 'oh, let's stop there' -- word of mouth is what I'm guessing drives this business.

We were recommended to visit this place by the entertainer for the evening, a belly dancer.  Efes isn't your typical sit-down restaurant -- in fact, you may have to kneel down.  The environment is to set a casual Turkish dinner setting.  If you have a big party, some of you may be sitting on the floor...don't worry, there are plenty of pillows.

The entertainment was good (if you like belly dancing) and the music was interesting.  Our party of 4 opted for the super sampler to start and the Efes mix to share.

I personally like this type of food.  Exotic, full of spices, not your typical meats.  My wife didn't necessarily find it great, but ate some and didn't complain :-).  I think the Doner Kabob was the best.  If you go with a group, the Efes mix was a great way to try a little of everything and was plenty of food for our party of 4.",0
"I recently attended a conference in AZ and stayed at the Squaw Peak. The grounds were very nice, and with all the on-site activities this hotel would be quite a draw for the kids. 

Being I don't have any kids, plus it was too cold to be out by the pool, activities on site were pretty limited. The gym facilities and the comfort of the bed made up for the lack of adult festivities. The gym was good sized and had ample new equipment. The bed was really comfortable and had great pillows. 

Great for a family vacation, A-Ok for the business traveler.",0
My family has been going to Dr. Brittan for 10 years.  He is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him.,1
"Well laid out zoo.Space good for animals...More for kids than adults. Zoo had limited number of animals...who were bored,listless,hiding mostly. Water ponds for animals were stagnant with algae! All in all Not a great experience. They are going to expand it seems...but they should pay more attention to the  animals they have .  Celtcharm",0
"All around great.  Great food, great atmosphere and great location if you work in the downtown area.",1
"I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe.. Everybody there was super nice and the service was great... I don't think our water glasses ever got to less than 1/2 full. The food was excellent. Price-wise it was a little more than we expected, but totally worth it. The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey, but ah well. Overall a very good experience- we will be back!",1
"We had a group dinner in one of their private rooms... the wine room, which as decent, obviously wines all around us, but a nice room for a group of 10.  Anyways, the food we had was amazing... be sure to try the the appetizer - DRUNKEN BREAD (Cabrales fonduta', White Wine, Garlic, Herbs).  For my entree I had the RIGATONCINI w/  Sweet & Spicy 'Schreiner's' Lamb Sausage, Heirloom Legumes, Local Greens,  
Charred Tomatoes, Chili, Pecorino.  It was perfect with a nice kick to it. Definitely recommend it.  And for dessert...PRADO SUNDAE
House Made Vanilla Gelato | Apple Wood Bacon | Caramelized Bananas  Amarone Cherries | Warm Chocolate Sauce | Roasted Almonds |
 Whip Cream | Biscotti Crumble... amazing... my first bacon dessert and it was worth it.  Also, try the 'DULCE DE LECHE' BREAD PUDDING  
Bourbon Caramel Sauce | Vanilla Anglaise | Chantilly Cream.  And get yourself a mojito while you are there, surprisingly good.  Of course this is the main restaurant at the Montelucia Resort, so expect ""hotel pricing.""  The menus are also seasonal, so my recommendations now might be completely different when you go there.",1
"First, just be careful of sitting on the planters on the north side of the building if you have to wait for a table... sometimes you might get surprised by ants... 

Now, if that didn't scare you away (and I was trying a little, because I am hoping to tamp down the wait time a scoche) please enjoy yourself!

Postino's Arcadia location is the original forerunner in the revitalization of the Phoenix scene. Postino. Cleverly located in a former Post Office. Thanks USPS.  

If you find yourself here with a wait (not always, but sometimes) look about yourself. The patrons at this location are uber friendly. With a larger-than-average number of regulars, some of them have very good stories to share, and are particularly generous. 

We waited one night and had two gentlemen with a high top table offer to let us share their space. It was a rousing good time full of mutual ease, and they left before our party of 3 had finished. When we went to pay, we found out they had taken care of the entire bill. Thanks guys!

It's that kinda place. A little magical, a little homey, a little bit of wonderful with great food and plentiful draughts, and just enough contemporary edge that you can impress a date, or drink with the dudes.",1
"Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching.",1
Funny how progress sometimes catches you off guard!  My local Fry's is going through a revamp and now I have no idea where anything is. It's just momentary inconvenience- I will find my bearings again and appreciate the improvements!,1
"I started working with Second Chance FitCenter in the spring of this year.  I went because I wanted to feel stronger, especially in my core.  I run and am a generally active dude, but wanted something more out of my physical body.  I had never done any type of ""personal training"" so I was a little apprehensive....and...

I have REALLY enjoyed working with Heat - she is a great teacher, which if personal training is anything it is a psychologist/mentor/butt kicker/saint...so in my book that is a great teacher!!  

Case in point:
A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was not sure if I was improving - mostly just my own mind being negative.  So Heat said, ""Next time we will try the very first workout we did.  Cool?""  I was game.  Dude!  I blew through that sucker - to the point were I was like ""this is cake""...of course on the second and third time through the sets  (and I think fourth on this day...) it got harder and harder...and I totally kept up.  It was awesome.  I loved it. 

My Checklist:  
Sense of accomplishment (check)
Strength building (check)
Piece of mind, knowing I am taking care of myself (check)
Good teaching and patience (check)

In short, I love my time at Second Chance.",1
"I've lived at Mark Taylor properties for about five or six years now and I have to say, they have declined greatly in the last few years.  When I first started living at my first MT property, the front office staff took the time to get to know you, knew you by name, kept abreast of any ongoing issues and were proactive about things.  

Now, they really seem to be nothing more than shills for what Mark Taylor has become, reacting to issues only when implored to do so.  Rent constantly goes up, even for those of us that have shown property loyalty years over.  Additional ""fees"" are even being added on for services that you may or may not even use -- either way you have to pay.  

The only reason that I didn't give them one star is because of the maintenance staff.  They are what the front office staff used to be.  Friendly, polite and very responsive to your problems.  They, in fact, have a pretty similar opinion of the ""front office"" folks as I do.  That is pretty telling.",0
"Oh Rhythm Room, how I adore thee!

I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play, I definitely try to make it.  They are rockin'.  

I dig the dancing, the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor!

I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair.  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open, get in line, get a table, then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!  

I always have a great time here!  And now that you can't smoke it's even better!",1
"my son really enjoys islands, great food, casual kid freindly atmoshpere we go here quite a lot and seem to keep coming back",1
"I've been looking for a decent prime rib in the area for years with no luck. That's all changed now. I found Lafitte's on Yelp, and was surprised - I had no idea it existed. I'm glad I came though. The prime rib was easily the best prime rib I've had in this part of town, and may be the best prime rib I've had in the under $20 price range in years.
  The place seems relatively unknown - it's hidden in the Embassy Suites Hotel. So on a Saturday night it was pretty slow - hardly anyone there. That's really a shame.
  The food was very good. It started with the salad. It seemed fresh - it didn't look or feel like it came from a bag. The greens weren't overly cold or wet, and it was arranged nicely on the plate. The bread was a simple sourdough. 
  We ordered the petite cut, and when our waitress brought out the plate, I was a bit shocked. It was much larger than everyone else's large cut. I could barely eat it - that's saying something. I had the creaole jambalaya as a side. It was tasty with some spice. The sausage was tasty. The vegetables were ok - a mix of squash, colored onions, etc.
  The waitress was friendly and courteous, and never let our drinks get empty. The nest part was that two of us ate for less than $35. I'll be back!",1
"flemings is always top notch. we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for $25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass. The selection was good from lite whites to deep reds a great way to sample a portion of there new wine list. then to top it off we received $25 gift cards for dinner. so we stayed and had the AZ resturant week pre fix dinner for $39 the food was wonderful. salads, soup lamb chops and filet. i guess to sum it up you can't go wrong with a meal from flemings. they also have a great happy hour.",1
Excellent. Fresh and yummy!,1
"I have been coming to Lux for years ever since I started graduate school here in AZ.  What is there to say that hasn't already been said other than hands down it is my go-to coffee spot in Arizona.  Such a warm and diverse group of people, rotating artwork, the perfect study music playing in the background (although it is played a bit loud), espresso roasted on-site and baked goods made on-site.  Always find an excuse to end up there for a café au lait or a velvet if I have a sweet tooth!",1
"Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)

1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A ""2"" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!

Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...

Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.

#17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar

Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. 

Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.


# 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal

Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even ""fenced in"" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.

Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.


# 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami

Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.

Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.  


Coconut Ice Cream: Yum

Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.

Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.

I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.  

Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV

Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?",1
"Always wanted to stop by, and give them a try. Only thing that stopped me were some bad rumors of how clean they are? But then again, how clean is all the places we eat at?? So I had their 8"" Meat Ball sandwich, this was my second choice? I wanted was their cheese steak! But they were out of cheeses steak. But I do not regret their meat ball sandwich. It was very good, wish their bread would have been more toasted. But I thought it was good anyways. Place looks like and feels like a lot like Subway. But I do agree, they do add more meat to the sandwich. I will probably come back again.",0
Great fruit and vegetables. Bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value. Check out the meat and deli. Cage free chicken and grass fed beef. Salmon and Tuna are fresh. They do have some good values here. The cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount.,1
"It's unfortunate their menu only has 4 sandwiches on it. The food was good, albeit leaves a lot to wish for. It came on a plate with a couple olives and nothing else. I would expect more for the $9-11 price tag. 

They market themselves as a sandwich shop but I just don't buy it.  More so, it was a hipster hangout where it seems people go to look cool.  Granted, the few items the did have were quite good, but I just expected a nice turkey sandwich, but that wasn't happening.  

The service was on the verge of incompetent but the owner did swing by with a loaf of bread.  Too bad we had to ask for oil at the counter to dip it in (our waitress was absent).  

Their water was unpalatable and they didn't have a lemon, lime, orange or anything wedge to make it slightly less offensive.  My friends that live in Phoenix told me though, this is just the way it is there.   

All in all, I certainly won't be rushing back but there is plenty of room for positive improvements.",0
"The only big Asian market in all of Phoenix which is, shockingly enough, located in the Chinese community center.

They have live fish and every canned good you can think of.

Want some canned unagi?  No problem.

Rice cooker that doesn't suck?  Got'em.

Some frozen shrimp balls?  Win.

They're pan-asian everything.. and if they don't have it, you're hosed!  This is the only game in town.",1
"Yikes...I won't be going back.  The ordering system is confusing. The staff also seemed confused. The food was very bland and pretty tasteless.  THIS PLACE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS HONEY BEAR'S NEAR THE AIRPORT!! Skip this bland chain, and go to Honey Bear's!",0
"Ok, Ok, I know I said I would never bring my clothes here, ever again.

I was having a rather busy week, so I told my Dad to drop my clothes off to the cleaners. I thought he was going to take my stuff over to Continental where I usually go, but he brought everything to Seville. 

I was a little upset, but being the angel of a son that I am, I bit the bullet and smiled. I thanked him for helping me out. 

When it came time to pick up my clothes, I carefully walked in (knowing I slammed them in my past review) and quietly picked up my clothes.

I got home, and noticed that one of my shirts had not been cleaned properly. There was a stain on it from what I think was cola. Later that day, I drove back to Seville, and they offered to clean it once more.

Flash forward to the next pickup day, the stain was still there. I asked for a manager, and it happened to be someone that seemed to be the owner. He asked how much I paid for the shirt. 

They gave me a check for the FULL amount. 

It's very rare that I write a review update that spans a few stars (only DeFalco's comes to mind), but Seville took my crappy situation, and made it right. 

I was VERY hesitant in coming back the first time around, and it was only because I was forced to. I'm glad everything worked out the way it did. Not because I got a new shirt out of it, but because I got a better experience.

Way to step up your game Seville. I'll be back if I'm in the area!",1
"Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.

Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.

 I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law.",0
"Finally another downtown lunch option.  I'm viewing this as the ""in-between"" place, in-between Arrogant Butcher's heavy on the lawyer, heavy on the political scene diners, and in-between ""Celtic-Hooters"", I mean, Tilted Kilt upstairs.  The food menu is interesting, a lot of appetizers.  Not enough salads for my taste. 
Compared to Arrogant Butcher and likely Tilted Kilt, the menu has less salads and less fried foods, but it'll be hard to find something healthy to eat.  It veers towards the comfort food side, with options like chili with cornbread souffle, and flatbreads served with burrata fondue.  There are a few flat bread options on the menu which is their version of pizza.  The day I went, the lunch room was busy. (You enter in through the a lobby shared with Stand Up Live).  Didn't get a chance to try out their amazing beer selection, will have to try that out the next time I'm here for a show.  The management and service is very friendly.  (Not in a scary way, just in a ""I really want to enjoy your experience way).  This is in sharp contrast to the service at Lucky Strike across the way which I've found to be downright rude at times.  Keeping my fingers crossed that they continue to do well.",1
"The time was 4:30am.  It was dark and a little chilly with the sun not yet up.  Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.

There were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.

Occasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.

Then something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.

Yes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.  

Of course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.  Thanks for taking the ass out of Christm.",1
"I really expected crappy food, because, after all, that's what sports bars generally offer.  Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!  Which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously.  I ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice.  these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso.

Now like I said, I expected crap.  But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco they'd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational.

Also, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight.

So why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item.

And one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.

So you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.  But if you try that shit on me...

Four stars.  The food is really damn good.",1
"I love this second location in the Royal coffee series as much as the one at the market!

Since it's summer - I thought I should mention that the iced coffee is so smooth and amazing that you don't even have to add anything to it!! Don't believe me?  Ask for a sample next time you are here and I guarantee you will be astounded!

A quiet and chill atmosphere if you want to work/study/read as well as a great place for delicious grab n' go coffee in the Biltmore area!",1
"My man took me to Fuego for a pre-birthday meal on a Wednesday night. I was surprised to see how many diners were there a. Because it's a Wednesday and b. Because it's in such an odd spot!! Once you get past the randomness of it's location, you will see how quaint and homey feeling it is. The two servers working the front of the house were friendly multi-taskers who welcomed, advised and fetched drinks while we decided on, then waited for our meal. We started with the scallop app and agreed that it was great, although small (3 scallops/$13). How bout one more tasty morsel? Apparently, it was small to save room for the hulking entrees we graciously received next! Wow! I had the seared ahi-a huge portion of it spicily seasoned, lightly seared, and great tasting! The man had the stuffed chicken breast, and inhaled it. It looked great as well. Also in the ""great"" category were the side dishes! Omg, the cheddar massed potatoes were so freaking scrumptious I could die! I also had the jalapeño creamed corn, that I mixed with the potatoes to make a combo from heaven! Man got the green chile cornbread casserole, which sounded meh, but tasted incredible! Such a fantastic meal! Stuffed with amazing food, and pampered by attentive servers, I was disappointed that I couldn't give Fuego 5 stars. But it wouldn't be prudent. 
Why, you ask? 
Because the sangria sucked. I had both the white, that tasted like watered down kool-aid, and the red, that tasted like old, cheap red wine mixed with coke a cola. They both sucked. Not good. Hopefully it was an off night, beverage-wise and I just happened to be there for it. Everything else was spot-on!",1
"Okay, since my latest review, I was contacted by the manager who expressed concern on my bad experience. Fran wanted to make sure they had the opportunity to make it right. I was impressed! I do want to say that even if the food sometimes needs a little sumptin sumptin, the customer service is Great and always has been! I give them superb credit for that & the ambiance is nice too. We went back for another try & we were satisfied. I definitely think you should stick with the thin or traditional crust, it was better. Also a note to update a previous review - they no longer have the Portobello Steak Sticks, not sure why, maybe a cost thing, but they were delicious and I will miss them! Another cool note that should be said because it can't be said about most places with an outdoor patio - they do not allow smoking in the patio dining area, which is such a refreshing change. It's nice to be able to enjoy the great Arizona weather this time of year. Thanks for that!

Final words... BoomBozz is on the top of our list again",1
I come here at least 3 or 4 times a month. Best Asian food in Phoenix however it is now closed,1
"I found this place on Yelp, and went there for the lunch buffet. Having read the reviews, I had really high expectations of the place, but was sorely disappointed. Watery sambar and rasam, hard idlis, dosas with a miserly amount of potato stuffing, gulab jamuns that tasted nothing like gulab jamuns, inattentive and too few waiters, and disgustingly dirty bathrooms---in my opinion, Udupi Cafe missed the mark completely. Their a la carte menu items might be better, but I am not going back to find out!",0
"Wings are not my favorite type of food, and I find most ""wing bars"" to be about the same. So when the East Valley Friday Night (#EVFN) Tweetup headed here I didn't have high hopes.

The wings were good, the beer was even better. I was honestly impressed by the excellent selection on tap, including some crazy stuff I had never head of before.  It satisfies both the Pickiest Vegetarian and Pickiest Beer Snob I know, so is on my list of places to take just about anyone to relax and have a good time.",1
"Yelpers prove to be right yet again with the average 3 stars on this one... 

I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie... It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.  

I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.  

""There are two tables before you,"" I was told.  ""It will likely be another ten minutes or so."" 

At that, I responded, ""is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?""

And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:

-While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!

-Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?

-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.

-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.

With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.  If I do, however, I will wait for a regular table!",0
"Today was our first time eating here, so armed with great reviews from other Yelpers, we sampled a bevy of appetizers from the happy hour menu (daily from 4:30-7p) and shared a pasta entree. Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.  

The antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers. 

The stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasn't looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  I'm not a huge melted cheese lover and would've preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband.

The restaurant wasn't super busy when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 8pm, the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85% filled.  The prices were higher than what we normally spend, but we had been given gift cards by my brother and happened to come during happy hour, so it wasn't that bad at all. Our bill came out to about $17 without tip and we didn't order drinks.  

You do have to sit in the bar area to receive the happy hour specials, but we didn't mind.  We'll be back!",1
"When Sen. Ken Cheuvront opened this restaurant, I was living in Midtown phoenix and it was at a time when a lot of restaurants in the area didn't exist. I was beyond excited of it's creation. 

It's a very trendy urban feel, with a nice patio on Central Avenue. Located at the bottom of Artisan condos, it's not a terribly easy place to see if you're driving by. They feature an incredible selection of wines and cheeses, of which you can purchase and take home as well as nosh in the restaurant. They also feature smaller sized entrees for those who are not looking to get stuffed on greasy messes and feel sick all night.

A particular favorite of mine are the ancho pork empanadas which are fluffy and crispy with a little orange in the pork. They are definitely delicious. Also great is their white pizza featuring sea scallops. 

There is nothing here that is oddly unique, but everything is interesting, and it is a nice spot to hang out with friends and have a nice night out. Especially during a first friday.",1
"Their food isn't bad, it's pretty hard to mess up gyros, rice, salad, and fries.  When it comes to this type of food it really comes down to preference.  For me, I didn't care for this place.  I like crispy fries, their fries are soggy.  I like Beef & Lamb gyros, theirs are Beef only.  I like a mixed green salad with light onion, they serve a shredded romaine salad with heavy onion.  Their prices are fair, portions large, and service friendly, it's just not for me.  They did have a lot of sandwiches and burgers that looked good, if that's your thing.",0
I loved it. The salad bar is not so great but everything else is excellent!,1
"First time here and it was really good. I ordered the bobbie sandwich since I hear everyone raving about it. It was ok. Not my favorite. Place is really clean and wasn't busy at all for lunch around 1130. I like going to a place where I can get in and get out. Staff was really friendly. They gave me this punch card.. buy 10 get the 11th free. Very nice. About the same prices as subway so I wasn't upset. Plus the sizes of food are definitely moneys worth. At least I think. For anyone in the Chandler area, this is definitely a place to stop in and try.",1
"I have been to RA a handful of times for happy hour, and was always annoyed by the loud music and crowd.  

However, this time I went here for happy hour as a first stop for a Bachelorette party and I had a great time. The upbeat social atmosphere was great for getting the night started. The group ordered a ton of appetizers and rolls, and even a drink each, and we walked out at about $30 a piece. The elderberry mixed drink was especially good.

Normally, I do not pick this place for sushi happy hour because I don't like their quality of sushi and like quieter placed to relax with a friend or two. But if your going for a fun group atmosphere, this place is perfect. But only during happy hour, otherwise it is definitely not worth the price.",1
"Delux makes good burgers, but you probably figured that out already. They also have good fries (sweet and regular potato thank you very much). They are kinda expensive. If I have to compare it to something I would compare it to California Pizza Kitchen. Better than a regular Pizza, but probably not worth the cost.",1
"I decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local Great Clips. I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top. The lady assured me that they did. I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna. Half way through this butchering, she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut. Kid you not, it was an inch longer at the sides than the center. I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls. I went home, set the clippers on 3 and finished the job......Would not go back here unless I lost a bet.",0
"After the Padres Spring Training game, we had reservations at Don & Charlie's in Scottsdale .  None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!",1
"So yummy!! My favorite Mexican place!! Love the chips, salsa, and bean dip. The extra spicy green salsa is so good too. We are regulars here.",1
"After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez, I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love!  From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!) this place is 5 star.  

I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.  This would be a great spot for dinner, drinks, or even an event (another Yelp event please!).

Highlights:
Tasty drink menu
Fabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish style
Great part of town
Sexy servers...dang

Impress someone: Take them to FEZ!",1
"If you need any office supplies, furniture, printers, computers, or one of them fancy electronic book readers, then you should check this place out. Not being a teacher or office manager/employee, I only come to these stores for printer ink. I was greeted with a friendly ""Hello, can I help you find something"" by one of the employees. My friend was looking for a stapler which the employee quickly guided us down the aisle to find an extensive collection, although I didn't see a red Swingline stapler ;)  

There is a huge print service station in the back and plenty of employees to help out with anything. Check out was super quick as there were three cashiers open and ready for a customer. Oh and I found out, thanks to my teacher friend, that you get a discount if you are a teacher. Pretty rad.",1
"I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldn't have found it otherwise.  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.  It's a quaint little diner with modest décor.  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.  Cheddar isn't better; it's all about havarti folks!  I needn't look further; I knew that's what I was having.  Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to come back and bring everyone I know.",1
"My husband and I went there for lunch today and because of vegegirly C.'s review about the deep fried pickles guess what we ordered??? OMG they were amazing! We ordered the cajun style and man oh man were they goooooood! We have never even heard of them but I am so glad we got them. So crispy and so hot! Mmmmm (and 1/2 priced)!!!

We got greeted and seated quickly. I ordered the chicken brie sandwhich and my husband had the meatloaf sandwhich. I am not sure where the comment about small portions came from because they were good sized and we were both stuffed!

The only change to the chicken brie would be to have the pears sliced thinner rather than having thick pears to bite through. Otherwise it was yummy.

I also ordered the ""Arizona Iced Tea"" for the first time since they didn't have fresh mint to make my mojito. I was pleasantly surprised at how light and refreshing it was.

We had the entertainment card which they didn't punch so we can use it again, and we will :)",1
"Pretty good mexican grub in the 480.

I had two carne asada tacos and a chile rellano plate.

The meat in the tacos was tender, tasty and plentiful, accompanied by chilantro, onion and hot sauce - typical ingredients but done right.

The chile rellano had a flavorful red sauce, the batter was not too soggy, the chile was cooked well (not crunchy/underdone, not squishy/overcooked) and the cheese oozed out when the chile was cut into.  This dish came with the standard rice and beans, neither of which was remarkable in any way shape or form.

Minus two big stars for what they consider guacamole.  It wasn't thick, it had no taste and it seemed as though this vital mexican staple was merely there as a garnish.  No bueno.  If it ain't green, thick and tasty, you better hit the drawing board.

Ya feel me?",0
I love that they are kid friendly and that chef Aaron came by to ask how everything was. Delicious food.,1
Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!,1
"Like Red Robin, Carraba's is my go-to Italian joint that I know I wont be disappointed in.  

I love their bread and the yummy oil/herbs that go with it.  I do ask for butter as well, but they always seem to bring out this frozen ball of butter.  I don't get that.

The best dish they have is their Pollo Rosa Maria.  It consists of two chicken breasts, stuff with fontina cheese and covered with a huge helping of sauteed mushrooms.  Make sure to get it with fettuccine alfredo.  It's a must!... if you don't like pasta, I dont know what to tel ya.  The combo of the two is a match made in heaven.

They have great salads and their own special house dressing.  Heads up on your ranch lovers.  they do not have ranch dressing.

As for their deserts, Im not much of a fan until they have their quarterly creme brulet.

Good food!",1
"When I bought my house, my realtor recommended these guys for the termite inspection.  They found a couple shelter tubes (old & inactive), so I paid them to treat the house and bought a 2 year ""warranty"".  Included in the ""warranty"" is a free annual inspection and any follow-up treatments necessary.  Sounded good.

First, the good part: the treatment appears to have worked just fine as I have not seen any new evidence of creepy crawlies munching mi casa.  That's good for three stars, I suppose.  

But here's where I have a gripe.  Last fall (1 yr in to the new house), it occurred to me in passing that I'd been here a year and that I should be expecting some sort of contact from the termite people to schedule the annual inspection.  A call.  A letter.  Something saying 'Hey, you're due.'  

(I don't think this is unreasonable to expect from a service-oriented company.  Shoot, it's been well over a decade since I bought my car, and the original dealership still sends me letters saying 'Hey, you're due for your 150k service!')

I hear... nothing.  And pretty much forget about it.  Until...

Another year goes by.  I receive a letter from them, ""Hey! Your warranty is up for renewal!"" I don't recall if the first letter contains (paraphrased) ""By the way, we'd love to schedule your free annual inspection!"" or if that came in the 2nd letter... or the 1st or 2nd call.  Or maybe it was the 3rd letter and the 3rd call... 

It certainly was in the 'Hey, your warranty lapsed but if you respond right away we'll re-instate it for you AND schedule your free annual inspection' letter, though.

Which, frankly, irritates me.  A lot.  

I will not be renewing my ""warranty"" with this company as my experience has shown that I'd be paying for nothing.  

Summary: 

Treatment? Fine. It was effective.  I have no more signs of bugs.  
Service? Awful.  They'll ignore you unless they want money from you.
""Warranty""? I'm not saying it's a scam, but... um.... I certainly did not receive ANY value for the money I paid them.",0
"I know I might some flack for only giving this place 3 stars, but really....it's no different than Chang's.  If I could give half stars, I would give it a 3.5.  Why?  Because I think it's better than Chang's.  It's exactly the same menu (just not as diverse), but cheaper.  If you are at this location, try Tott's instead.  I bet you'll start going there more often than here.",0
"Johnnie's Garbage dog is the work of the God's. You can't go wrong with any of the dog's here so when you can't make up your mind and everything looks so good - why not just have it all! Seriously try this one. 

Be forewarned it can be messy, so get a good grip because once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down.",1
"Not impressed, loud atmosphere, bland overpriced sandwiches. 10 employees behind the counter and no clean tables. How many people does it take to make a sandwich? More like the employees are just here to hang out with each other than work.",0
"I know... I know... it's Phoenix but I expected something far better.  Perhaps my mistake.  Located in what looks like an old fast food location this is a no frills, no cart, and no nonsense dim sum experience.  Don't think I will be going back (for many reasons) but if you are craving some bao or need a dumpling fix this place will do... just dont expect much.",0
Love love love this place!,1
Because sometimes you just want to flip the bird at calorie counting and healthy living.  This valley landmark is the place for satisfying that once in awhile sinful urge to screw up your carefully laid out dietary plans.,1
"I love this outdoor mall.  It's clean, it's open and has a wonderful restaurant selection.  It doesn't have a huge amount of stores but the stores it does have fits the bill. Now that it has J Crew life got a little sweeter.  I really miss the Border book store, however. 

Some cool Biltmore activities are yoga in the park and movies in the park.  The movies are usually classics and happen during the fall.  Another bonus, is it's super dog friendly.  If you have a four legged friend to walk around with, make sure you walk to the east end of the mall and visit Arizona Humane Society's Petique to visit the other pups.

Happy Shopping!",1
"This is the best place if you want to escape Arizona and feel a bit of wine country. Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon. My favorite part is uncorking a bottle of wine, and ordering lunch to be eaten outdoors. So spring weather is the best. Buy a mini loaf of bread and try their delicious olive oils and spreads...super inexpensive appetizer at just $1.50 and the samples are free.  They offer many sandwiches and the waffles with berries are to die for. Looking forward to trying their pizza...on my next visit. Regardless of what you choose follow up with gellatto...yum or take home some olive oil cupcakes. Delicious and moist...but a little spendy",1
"This cafe provided me with my first Ethiopian cuisine experience. It was delicious and I am eager to go back. The most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes. They had as many options as those with meat which I really appreciate (doesn't happen very often.) The service was great. You can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons. The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes. 

We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup. This was probably my favorite part of the meal, it was absolutely delicious---satisfying and hearty. We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera, a crepe-like bread you eat the main dishes with.

This is a fun way to eat (with your hands) and opened up a new world of foods for us! Can't wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba.",1
"I can't believe I didn't write a review of Metro after my first visit but I got a second chance last Saturday night with Dottsy Z, Andrea K and company.  We had a reservation for 8PM for 4 of us, and at 730PM Andrea asked us to add 2 guests and when Dottsy called Metro they said of course, but please be advised you may have a little wait for the larger table. Which leads me to the only bad point of the evening:

We had to wait ONE AND A HALF HOURS for our larger table. We had all expected and accepted a 30 minute wait. After about 40 we went to the bar to get some wine and oysters (otter creeks = yummmm).  After an hour had passed and no one had come to address the situation with our group, I approached the hostess and she was very apologetic and offered to comp our bar tab, which was incredibly nice. 

When we were finally seated our server was friendly and attentive and had gorgeous blue eyes. Hello!  We were all starving and got right to the point with our orders: I started with the cucumber soup and no amount of yums or mmmmms can fully describe the delight that was set before me. A cold soup, this is made with cucumbers, buttermilk, dill and olive oil, with chunks of lump crabmeat and a dollop of caviar thrown on top, because why the hell not?!  Also, the soup came in a really large bowl and I was full by the time I finished it. I did soldier on to my main course which was the Moules Frites which is what I had the first time I came here and is a truly inspired dish with juicy fresh mussels, and a broth with thyme, garlic and perhaps a little white wine. Then to add insult to injury they serve the huge casoulet with a hearty portion of herbed french fries that were the perfect crispness and didn't leave oil on my hands. 

Sadly I had to leave some of those friends behind, but only because it was time for dessert! I chose pot de creme which is normally topped with brioche. I requested a brioche-free pot and it was no problem. I was served a tiny ramekin of creamy custard topped with a sort of peanut butter syrup/creme and three slices of caramelized banana. It was really yummy though within 10 minutes my heart was racing from all the sugar. 

I will point out that this dinner took 2 full hours (we left at 11:30PM) making this the longest I ever spent in a restaurant (3.5 hours are you kidding me?) which is why I ultimately docked one star. Based on food alone Metro Brasserie deserves 10 stars.",1
"I'm so in love with this place :) I tried the pepperoni pizza and I was AMAZED. i love that they have a fresh herb/vegetable garden in the front.  It's all about the FRESH ingredients these days.  I can't wait to go back and try different dishes. I'd like to try the cheese platters :) mouth watering as we speak.  going again to day so I'll keep adding to this review. STAY TUNED! BTW, the decor reminds me of the VIG but definitely more spacious dining area.",1
This is a cool venue to catch a show. I actually played a show here and it was good times. They have a large dance floor or an area where people can gather to watch performers. They also have a nice sized Bar which can handle a good sized crowd. We all know that is a must when it comes getting a drink in a crowed venue. I really enjoyed this spot and had a fun time rocking peoples face off!,1
"Had lunch here with 6 coworkers and the server accomodated 5 seperate checks with no fuss. She quickly brought out two baskets of soft warm bread that looked handmade, along with pouring out balsamic vinegar and light olive oil for dipping.

The server described the day's special, but we all ended up ordering eight inch pizzas (a lunch only size.) I had bacon and chose to have it cooked in the optional brick oven for $1 extra (not sure why they offer it seperately, but exp. at other places made me like the way it cooks better than reg. oven.)

It wasn't much to go on, but the food was good, the service friendly and efficient, and the everything was clean and neat. Recommended if you're in the area.",1
"As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJ's. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners, good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt, cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, I'm all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot.

The downside? It's not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a ""regular"" grocery store. This particular TJ's is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks it's an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop, and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly. I'm all for giving your kid responsibility, but a) you still have to, you know, keep an eye on the kid and b) a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not, repeat, NOT the time to do so.",1
"Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu.  My fav Barbecue chicken salad
no longer has a hint of the same taste. It should now be called flavor of tomato. 
 Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country. Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor. Im sure many people will love these new changes.  Yet, Im sad it's not the same. I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich! No joking!!!!!!!!!",0
"Food wise, this is my favorite Lenny's location. They make the perfect jalapeno cheese burger. The fries are really good too.

The location kind of sucks. Its  surrounded by a greyhound station, a liquor store and some kind of AA hall. Need I say more?",0
"With quaint accommodations, friendly staff and interesting selection of food choices, I was able to forgive, and forget, that the Centurion didn't yet have a liquor license. 

The Centurion is a cozy (and by cozy, I mean small) place. But it has personality and I can imagine myself hanging out on the patio after work - in cooler weather. 

For those vegetarians out there, Centurion offers a diverse selection choices. For our lunch, my companion and I split a Heirloom Tomato (with Brie) Panini and the Shitake Spinach Risotto.  Both were flavorful. And the prices are quite reasonable at $8/each. 

The menu offers a diverse selection which includes burgers, pizza, pasta, salads (all around $9) and some higher priced dinner entrees (ranging from $23-$42). 

I hope to return to try their dinner entrees, the blue cheese crusted filet mignon sounds wonderful! 

I feel like I had fallen upon a hidden neighborhood gem. I'm crossing my fingers for their liquor license!",1
"This is the second time I've eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first. 

The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak. Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places I've been to in Phx.

It's very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, especially the meat, cheese and pasta counters.

Check 'em out you won't be disappointed!",1
"I recently saw a Coyotes game here and I was seriously impressed. This arena is super nice, almost mall-like and clean on the inside. What also impressed me was how much stuff there is around the arena. Where I'm from, you'd have to drive somewhere else if you want to go to dinner before or hang out after the game. Here you can just stay in your cozy little free parking spot and hang around. Probably my only gripe is that the screens on the inside could be a little bigger, but other than that. this arena is right up there.",1
"Winco Foods is all the rage now.  Will this continue or will Winco lose it's luster once it's just another grocery store and the new kid in town?

There's nothing special about Winco.  It's your typical grocery.  I'm not a savvy coupon clipper or price matcher so I cannot attest to the savings to be had at Winco.  A thrifty shopper I know claims the savings are to be had.

That said there are two negatives that shine brightly at Winco: credit cards not accepted and cheap bags.

Do not come here if your earnings are running low.  I just gathered my weekly groceries and expected to charge 'em.  Not a surprise I was looking forward to after waiting in the long lines.

On my first visit most of the bags were torn up the seam and the handles were split.  For one reason or another the cashier actually helped bag my haul.  How she could hand over bags so blatantly ripped is beyond me.

On the plus side, Winco stocks Shasta Tiki Punch.

Winco isn't a terrible place but I don't see any reason to jettison Fry's and Target (unless I'm in the mood for Tiki Punch).

Take it or leave it.",0
"YOWZA! I love this place. I had heard great things about this place before and actually received some of the olives and olive oil as a gift last year. I decided to take my mom and try it out for lunch. The food was pretty good, but the best thing for me is that they have Cerignola olives! This was music to my ears when they told me they had them. I have been looking everywhere, checking every grocery store, gourmet shop in Chandler and Tucson and nobody has them. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu! Oh and expect a little off roading, the parking lot is loose gravel :)",1
"Sushi is not just a meal, it's an experience...Everything from the way fish looks to the crisp green of the seaweed is art.  The smell of the sake and the sound of crisp sizzle on the grill create an environment conducive to stretching the palette.  Yasu's does this like no other sushi place...The fish is pristine, the rice like air, and the flavors intense and varied.  My wife and I live a stone's throw from this place you would never see it if you didn't know it was there.  It's like a little secret that is starting to get out...All I can say is that it is hands down the BEST sushi in Phoenix, period.  Get the fried oyster rolls, get the grilled mackerel or trout...just try it!",1
"Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my ""plastic money"" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???  

The customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying. 

Needless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores...",0
"Formerly Sandbar, this is a great new spot in Central Scottsdale to chill out after work. Good Mexican food, good strong drinks, and a massive outdoor patio with pleanty of drinking activities. They also have plenty of TVs to watch the big game. FYI - It gets slammed on weekend nights...",1
Everything I have had here has been wonderful. Very fresh. The service is good. The food is wonderful. I have eaten at this one and the one in Glendale. Excellent food in both locations.,1
"My hubby and I go almost ever Friday for happy hour. We love the chicken nachos! It's also one of the few places that has kept Blue Moon on draft instead of switching to Shock Top (a bonus for my husband). They recently expanded their wine list to my delight and I've been having fun giving the new vino a try.
The staff and manager are consistently friendly and the food is consistently good! Try the BBQ chicken pizza or the steak salad! Yum!",1
"This is hands down the best place for bagels...
but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever.
I just wish they would open on in Greenville.
Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese...
I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale...

"yo, bro, let's compare forearm tats and drink some New Castle. P.S. everyone saw you bif it on your fixie as you rolled up to the bike racks.

for real, most predictable crowd ever!!!!

I can talk mad shit on this place all night long, but when it comes down to it, I love it. The location lends to its patrons- alternative college students living in the only historic (PHX like) neighborhood in Tempe. Plus it is right next to HTC, so everyone is sure to be rocking the flyest of  -50 gauges. puke.

but.......the charm of casey's is in the cats. they are cool and roam around. Also, the best patio ever, and lots of room. Don't go inside unless you can't get a drink b/ your waitress forgot about you (which is most likely what happened). Or if you like old dudes 65+ eyefucking the shit outta you be my guest. Also, one night after I was there, the next morning someone had charged $2000+ on my credit card for an ad in New Times. shady......or recession? I think I know how this happened, they leave your card within an arms reach from the bar inside, face-up so any creeper with 20/20 can get a peek and thief you out of your identity and money, or maybe it was an inside job???

but I really like this place and still have ""casey's nights"" even though jimmy eat world sucks and I live in phoenix. 

oh yeah, this place is haunted too....and if you are a girl do not go pee in the grotto.gross.",1
Very authentic and very good Vietnamese food. Great value for the money and clearly a favorite with the local Vietnamese.  The spring rolls were very tasty and came with a terrific peanut sauce.  They also provide many other typical condiments on the table to spice up your dish.  I had the slice beef Pho and it was delicious!  I'll be back.,1
"If you are looking for TLC in very unique pet products and family style customer service, Posh Pet Boutique and spaW is where you need to go. They have retailed my collection of Decadent Digs there for going on 3 years, since the first day she opened her doors. I have seen her business blossom and become the destination and extra sunshine of the Troon Area. Her loving warmth (sort of Doris Day way) makes you feel like you are in her home and makes want you to come back often. She carries a huge collection of class act merchandise from cute clothes to a killer Kitty high-rise and offers excellent grooming. She is worth the trip.",1
"Food-  Amazing nachos!  Best i've ever had.  Plenty of toppings, well worth the 9 dollars

Service-The guy behind the counter is very nice and makes excellent suggestions and remembers me every time I come in and asks how his suggestion panned out!

Ambiance-Nice little spot, nothing fancy",1
"The Farm at South Mountain is a splendid little slice of the country- right here in the middle of the desert!

The plentiful green grass spotted with picnic tables makes me want to plan a family reunion. There are gardens and walkways to explore. From first glance, The Farm is a quaint, family-run farmhouse.

Visit Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast and you won't be disappointed. I've personally enjoyed the Morning Glory Benedict on several occasions, while my brother is a big fan of the Farm Monte Cristo. Both dishes are made with as many local ingredients as possible... mmm... local-icious. 

The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to ""groin-grabbingly delicious."" (a la Homer Simpson) It's slow baked ham, over easy eggs, and melted cheese between two generous pieces of French Toast. Served with warm maple syrup, this is it, folks. The grand-daddy of breakfast foods. 

The service here is generally solid. Our servers tend to be interesting, friendly, and adorable- all good qualities to have when you're serving breakfast to someone who isn't happy about being up early.

I'll return... and return... and return. I'm hooked.

I only wish Morning Glory wasn't closed for the summer! Killing me.",1
"Made the mistake of coming here on opening day.  Not a good idea for someone with anxiety issues.  They had a bunch of really good deals, but I fear it is probably going to be the same as going to Walmart.  And I HATE going to walmart.",0
"If you need something obscure, or you need to get everything you need in one place, then here you go.  I also love how many different 1 shot mini bottles BevMo has to choose from.",1
"I woke up this morning craving a breakfast burrito. Fortunately just 3 days ago, a menu was left on our door for Cisco's Grill (with some great marketing I might add). Conveniently located right up the street from my house, I've been curious about this place since they opened! I strapped on my shoes and walked on over... upon entering I was greeted cordially and placed my order for a chorizo and egg burrito with cheese... The cook went to work and 5 minutes later I was holding a fresh hot burrito and a complimentary pineapple water! Cisco came out and introduced himself while I was waiting and chatted with me for a few minutes. Its clear to me that he's very passionate about his restaurant! The service is top notch!

The menu itself is fairly generic, typical burger and fries, tacos and burritos, but everything is so fresh and prepared well! I'd recommend this joint to anyone looking for a quick, inexpensive bite to eat!",1
"""6 inch tuna on white bread, with everything including spinach, but NO pickles"".

Not even joking, this THE only subway that ever gets my sandwich right. Thank you for the $5 meal deal, it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch.",1
"Sorry Banana Leaf... I'm usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful.  Really... it was almost not edible.  The packaging was not great, so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start.

Perhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty!

Seriously, I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before!

I will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time.  I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.  

So, needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot.  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.  Sorry Banana Leaf!",0
"Just kind of there with nothing special about this convention center. And the Phoenix downtown area is pretty boring and sparse except for the baseball stadium right next to it with some cool bars and restaurants. When there isn't a game, this area seems pretty dead.

Bottom line: Ho hum. Baseball stadium nearby is great entertainment option but can be a pain with all the traffic if you are trying to get out of the convention center area in the evening.",0
"Came here in a daze after not having slept for a loooong time and flying in to the airport with Dad; reminds me of the nice breakfast diners in Chicago, got the combo with turkey sausage (still greasy--defeats the purpose), eggs (always the same everywhere), french toast (more white bread, nothing too special but filling), coffee.  Nice atmosphere and no major problems, would be great for the weekend brunch!",1
"Finally Biltmore gets a sushi place after the departure of Ayako! Well if you have been to Stingray in Old Town Scottsdale, this is same menu, etc. But I happened to like the atmosphere at this location better!
Came here for a happy hour, had a drink called the Tokyo Tease(delish!) and since I love sashimi sushi (which isn`t on the happy hour menu, no big deal), ordered my sashimi combo, which didn`t disappoint!! Included tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Did enjoy the bevy of assorted rolls that went by. I like the outside/inside seating bar- great on beautiful weather days! I will be back for more!!",1
"Whenever I get my car cleaned, this is the place that I'll always go to.  They're nice, efficient, and they do a great job.  My car is still shining a week later!

The wait is very minimal.  The staff works together fantastically, and you can watch them clean your car so you don't have to worry about anything getting stolen.  Yeah it's a little small, and a bit shabby, but like the first reviewer said, you don't go there for the waiting experience!

Definitely worth the money!",1
"This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it weren't for the flavored crust I would not come back. 
But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howie's is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment. 
You'd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed.",0
Good & fast food. Prices are fair. They charge a fee for Bank cards.,1
"Fancy  shop with great kitchen items that I would use for our kitchen. 
It seems whenever I go in there their products don't work. 
Avoid ordering any of their coffee pots because we had to return them twice in a row. It seems like whenever we walk in there the employees don't seem to be knowledgeable about the products there. 
I give this store three stars for having a variety of kitchen items and an enchanting place to visit.",0
"Just open.  I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich.  Both were excellent, modern interpretations on classic lunches.  I highly reccommend this place.

P.S.:  iPad driven POS system is way cool.",1
"Too long.......it took me way too long to make it to Sens. Sens is what we need more of in Phoenix!

Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself, Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here, Johnny Chu.....alright, I admit it...I like saying his name!

The Asian tapas idea is new to me, having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas,  but alas never an Asian tapas joint. I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)!

The Tofu dishes are amazing. How do you learn to love Okra? Get it at Sens. The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts. One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor - fantastic!

I will be back to Sens Tapas & Sake Bar soon - do you think you could invent an ""Asian Sangria""? C'mon Johnny, I know you can do it!",1
"Blah...Very disappointing. I ended up at the San Carlos when it was the only hotel downtown that wasn't sold out. I don't think it was worth the $200 a night, but I didn't have a choice. 

The shower was amazingly tiny. I felt like I was being frisked up against a wall just to wash my hair.

The walls are super thin. I could hear snoring from one room, coughing from across the hall and the TV on the other side....just awful.

The staff wasn't very helpful---forgot to program a wake up call, refused to assist when an alarm had been going off in another room for over an hour in the middle of the afternoon, etc. 

The ghost lounge was very cute...I went down and it was a swing night which seemed to be fun. 

I'd be willing to come back to the lounge, but not the hotel for sure.",0
"I think the lady behind the counter didn't like me.  Could've just been me.  I don't know.  It's just how I felt.

When my boss first told me about this place, I thought he said ""Al Molina"" and I was like, ""You mean the guy who played Doc Ock in Spider-Man II?""

I've been here a few times, today was the first time I'd been to El Molino in about 8 months.  I happened to be in the area, popping in to buy a backpack at Staples an decided to get a burrito to go to munch on when I got back to my office.

One thing I really didn't like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom.  That's something very typical of, like, a gas station that bums use to shit on the floor.  I went to the bathroom and it said I had to ask for the key.  I went back to the counter and the woman disappeared in the back so I kinda just did a little pee-pee dance until she came back.

It was a little too expensive for what it was.  A thing of chips was like $4.50.  That's crazy.  Granted, the chips are really good and you get a lot of em, but... don't you have a thing of chips I can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion?  I got all these chips in the fridge at work that won't be edible on Monday, probably.

The burrito I got was very tasty.  The salsa they gave me was also super good.  Nice and smokey and spicy.  Seriously.  Man, that shit was spicy.  I kind of have a soar throat today so that spiciness felt super good to me.

I had to laugh when I opened up my to-go back once I got back to work because I actually thought maybe I didn't get ANY salsa, but when I took a look they gave me soooo much.  I made a small tower beside my meal, like a Stonehenge of heat.

Three stars:  Good.  Not great.  Weird bathroom.  Unfriendly lady.  Good food.  Too expensive.",0
"*Gamestop Burger*


Visiting a friend in Phoenix I first see Smashburger from the street. Upon first glance my other friend and I thought it was a Gamestop cuz the sign looked just like it. We both said ""Haha, we thought that was a Gamestop.""
Our friend goes, ""Yeah I first thought that too when I first saw it. It's pretty good there. Do you guys wanna go?"" 

So we ended up eating our first meal in Phoenix at Smashburger, and we were glad we did. The food was really good, and the smashfires were a great addition to our burgers.

I ordered the BBQ Bacon & Cheese. It was quite delicious, and a little on the greasy side. BUT that's where all the flavor is!!!!!

This burger has some hot steamy buns. Yeah I said it .
Unlike most places that use the typical sesame seed bun Smashburger uses egg buns. These buns are a lot softer and compliment the burger very nicely. 

I decided to order the smashfries which are seasoned with garlic and rosemary. These were an awesome choice. For those of you who may not like those flavors they offer regular fries as well. 

Seeing that I hadn't eaten since morning I also ordered the Arizona devil dog. This had guacamole, tomatoes, jalapenos, habenero cheese and a spicy chipotle sauce all on an all beef hot dog. I liked it. It was like nachos minus the chips on my hot dog. 

Now this place is on the pricey side, but if you feel like dishing out $8+ for a burger and fries then this place is not too shabby. 

Different locations call for different items on the menu, so don't be surprised if the Arizona devil dog cannot be found outside of Arizona. I say that they should combine all the regional menus to make one giant-mega selection-awesomeness menu. But I highly doubt that'll happen.",1
Best Thai food!!!  Order the dry garlic chicken.,1
"This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as I've been to.  I had the mahi mahi tacos, and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together, as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation.  

Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses, about which I don't have sufficient words to do justice.  Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view.  They were dressed tastefully, not in the slightest bit 'slutty', but holy god.",1
I LOVE this place. I have been craving their Baked Spaghetti Pie again for 5 years and I finally got it today since I'm back for a business trip! I remember pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious. Their prices are great too! Very polite staff.,1
"First time there the other night.  Friday night, not very crowded for 7:30pm.  We were shown to a table in what looked like a back room - the table was not set, there was just a tablecloth and that was it.  The room is to the right as you walk in.  There were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered (no view) - it was weird so I immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant.  Decor seemed 'cheap' - just my initial impression.  Food was pretty good.  Pancetta wrapped shrimp app was good; Service was good.  Entrees were pretty good - Chicken Parm, Fettucine Bolognese all tasty, but not sure I would go back.  Caesar salad was a bit disappointing...asked for anchovies on the side - never delivered.",0
We visited last week.  The lady offered us a lot of samples of their food so we could pick out what we liked.  The food was excellent and the service was great.  The restaurant was very kid friendly.,1
"Burger was great, but the service wasn't so great. When thumbing through my wallet for cash, the owner rudely interrupted me and told me they don't accept cards, only cash payment. 

When my friend asked what he would recommend, he shoved a menu in his face and said ""I'd recommend looking at a menu"". 

I fought back the urge to just leave and go somewhere else and ordered  the Good Ass burger, which was avocado and bacon, so you can't really go wrong with that. The fries were good and the burger was pretty good. 

Service: 1 star
Food: 4 stars

Average: 2 stars

"Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!

TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.",1
"Was out on a date yesterday, and we had worked up an appitite.  We were on the light rail, and decided to stop off on Mill to find food.  Walked down mill for a second, and found silvermine subs.  SCORE!

I had never been here before but I liked it.  Its not the fanciest place.  Simple location, good food, decent prices.  They seemed to have a good selection of hot and cold subs, with different side items and combo meals.  I got the King Bullion, and it was tasty!  I went with the small sub (5 inches) a large pop and some chips.  Food was up in no time flat.  Seems to be a college kid hang out, especially considering the location. 

Would return in a heartbeat.  Tasty, reasonably priced, and right off the light rail on Mill.",1
"This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple.  I personaly like the roasted / peking duck.  The Shrimp Lo-Mein is good, Fast, Friendly Service, No MSG.
Lunch Specials  during the week are awesome too.",1
"I'll be charitable - this place sucks!

I went there because a friend had *exactly* the piece of furniture I needed and he got his from Ikea.   After wandering around the store forever, I finally found the right department.

The people working there were cold. uncaring. not helpful. no concept of customer service.  I left in disgust!

Couple of days later, I was in Cost Plus World Market @ 18th St. & Camelback.  Voila!  I fould what I wanted - for close to the same price.  the BIG difference:  Warm smiles, friendly people, volunteered to go out of their way to help me.  Felt like I was among long-time friends!  They even delivered when they said they would.

And, no need to drive half way to tucson and back!

Ikea?  Don't be foolish.  Cost Plus?  Now, there's a place that earned my repeat business!",0
Not lesbian/gay friendly at all. I should have read the previous review before going.,0
"Good time. We sat at the sushi bar and were entertained. We brought my 9 year old very picky daughter and she had fun. She has some edamame and a plate of plain noodles. Sticking me for 5 bucks for a small pile of plain noodles I felt was outrageous. Sushi was good and rolls were fantastic. Asked the sushi chef to make his favorite and it was a spicy tuna roll with a sweet sauce that was awesome. We'll come back, but I'll give me daughter a hot dog before we go.",1
"You know, for a goodwill this one really isn't bad!  They have a ton of clothes that are actually displayed to make them look orderly and clean instead of the usual crammed heaps and stacks you see.  I love the books - a great selection of books you have always meant to read (and I don't mean the old classics, though they have those too) like James Patterson, Anne Rice, and all those gooey Twilight books.  Looks like they moved out most of the furniture recently, but perhaps they will be getting a new shipment soon.  Lots of knick-knacks and vases, and about 25 printers to choose from!  Check here first if you are looking for one of the above stated items - they is a good chance you will find it!",1
"This restaurant is close to my office, so we go for lunch at least once a month.  I love that it's bright, with great modern decor, and the seating is comfortable.  Service is always very good.  The prices and portions are a average for the area.  The cuisine is a twist on Sonoron, but nothing extraordinary.",1
"Here's the deal. I said I was done with OT, but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot. 

My friend was right.

Everything I had a problem with before was remedied. I went in unannounced, didn't tell anyone about a previous bad experience, and I was given some of the best service I've received in town. When we went in, we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit.

No texting employees, no indifferent waitstaff. The chef was in the food window expediting food, making sure it went out promptly and correctly. Not only was our server attentive, but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks, debris on the table, etc. 

The decor has been refreshed, and although I didn't dislike the decor originally, it is definitely an upgrade as well. Now its much cleaner, but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before. 

Props to the new management. Well done. I'll be back.

PS - forgot to order side syrup. Curious to see if they still charge $2.",1
"Fabulous place.  The food is good and the selection of organic and specialty items is nice.  Love the butcher shop and Jerry the Cellarmaster is abslutely fantastic.  Seriously, if you want a bottle of wine - he is the best resource.  And if you go back frequently he tailors his suggestions to what you like.  My favorite thing about this store is that the staff tries so hard to treat you like a valuable customer.  They remember your name, ask after your kids and honestly act like they like you.  It feels like a small town grocery store and I love that.   Breakfast is fantastic and the coffee is great.  Everyone at the coffee counter is terrific.  This was a really great addition to the neighborhood.",1
I was a little bit scared to eat at this place but I was pleasantly surprised. I got the chicken egg foo yung and boyfriend got spicy shrimp. The portions were humongous and it was very delicious. The Buffett didn't look very appetizing. I would definitely only order from the dinner menu. Can't wait to go back.  Food is dirt cheap and so delicious.,1
"Nice park. But people need to keep an eye on aggressive dogs. My 4 month old puppy was beat up by another dog this morning. 7-7-2012 We were the first ones out there this morning, around 5:15am We were just out there walking around, This lady and her grey/ and white dog. Was walking around. Then the dog came up to us for no reason, and jumped on my puppy just started beating him up. The owner didn't even do nothing.. The dog was almost killing my puppy. I yelled at the dog tried to stop him. Then he attacted me. Bit me very bad on left hand. The owner  asked me where I was going I said west valley hospital. I was very scared. She said she would meet us @ the Hosiptal. I never saw her show up.. Those kind of Aggressive or angry dogs shouldn't be allowed out there. Yea go at your own risk. But people should 
not let angry or aggressive dogs out there. The owner didn't even say sorry or give me her name, nothing.  Shame on her. And her aggressive dog.  I hope she teaches that mean old dog some manners...   Brenda Hansen... The Hosiptal visit was long. But west valley took special care of me.. Thank you Hosiptal",0
"Great neighborhood sports bar.  They've got something like 35 HD TV's  all arranged so you can get a good view no matter where you sit.  The staff is friendly, drinks are inexpensive (like $10.00 for 1 beer and 2 vodka/soda), and their food is tasty.  They have a large comfy outdoor seating area if you want to catch some fresh air.

My only complaint about this place is on the weekends they usually have a cover band... not that the band is terrible or anything (i think they switch it up so it's  not always the same band anyway), but they're loud and if you're there to watch a game, forget about hearing anything relating to the game, including the people you are with.  I can see how this could go either way with people since it does add kinda a rockin' environment, which is nice, depending on your mood.

Oh and they have those satellite speaker things so you have this box at your table and you can tune the sound to whichever game you're interested in listening to, not that it matters when the band is playing, but every other time it's cool.",1
"Oh good another Paradise Location for meeting up with friends after work. Clean neat and well manned , the worker bees seemed in real force, cleaning refilling and picking up plates. Nice to see. 
Food wasn't quite paradise but it was tasty and filling . I usually have the panini with chicken and artichoke but today went for a Chicken wrap.Tasted like a chicken wrap.  The peach decaf teas was refreshing and the mango tea was too. 
I love the casualness of the setting and the ease with which you can order at your leisure . If you are meeting people with different time constraints , this can be very helpful.",1
"Great discovery for me!  I popped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  I had the best veggie tacos ever!  They were extremely flavorful and filling.  I don't know the secret to the accompanying rice and beans but they were also on point...just delicious!

The only drawback is the size of the place.  Since I dined alone, I sat at the bar.  It wasn't the most comfortable seating but I'd do it again in a heartbeat for those spicy veggie tacos.  I will definitely return to Fuego Tacos.",1
Awesome food. Highly recommend. Had gyros platter . Generous portions and excellent meat.  Check out their spices and other food stuff. Got couscous very cheap.,1
"If you are staying in Phoenix for any length of time, this is a must stop for at least a cocktail.  From walking through the kitchen, to being seated promptly in a booth, this is quintessential gastronomic delight.  Durant's is an icon and legend. Period.  Wine list is great, have a well-versed sommelier also.  I never order Filet, but when in Rome...",1
"OK, so this is how much I love this product. I first tasted Lee's at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again. When I was invited to the next year's Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth. ""Is Lee's gonna be there?"" ( Ok, maybe the whole French restaurant's Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too, but I digress) When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner. I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now. The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover. I will have to visit the shop soon.",1
"I love pita Jungle! Everytime I am in town, I make it a point to get here. The food is fresh and healthy(ish). There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious. I would recommend you eat here, especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare.",1
I've always had a pleasant experience at Mojo in Tempe Marketplace. I have been to this location about 4 times and they always provide good quality and value. My favorite is the red velvet froyo.,1
"Cute coffee place located right near work, so I stop by for an iced chai and a muffin before my morning shift. The staff is super friendly and knows my order by heart, which I love. Pretty good chai, too! Not the best but much better than some other places, and when it's made like soy, it still tastes spicy and delicious (unlike a chai I had at Cartel which tasted purely like soy, super disappointing). I haven't tried their Avalanches yet, but I really want to, they look really good. Prices are decent too, about $5 for a medium chai and a delicious muffin. 

I think the decor is cute too, looks like it belongs up north in Flagstaff or Sedona.

All in all, if you're in the area, definitely stop by, but I wouldn't necessarily go far out of my way for it.",1
I ordered a thin crust pizza for carry out from this location.  The staff was very friendly and the pizza was pretty good.  I look forward to trying their pasta in the near future.,0
"This review is based solely on service - not the food. 

I am sitting in a booth at RA as I type this - that is how upset I am with the host staff at ra. I called ahead to inform the restaurant that we would have a party of 8. When we arrived the girls at the front were so rude I almost walked out. We waited 35 min for our table and the entire time the host staff was looking my entire group up and down giving us the ""stink eye"". I am sorry that you are 18 years old, work for $8 and have a stick up your butt, but do not make us feel unwelcome. My girlfriend and I went to the back to use the bathroom - the host followed us back and asked us what we were doing - not to help us find the bathroom but just to be a snob. From here on out ra is ruined for me.",0
"Ted's rules.  Great char-grilled hot dogs, killer onion rings, and a great atmosphere all add up to a good old dog-eatin' experience.",1
"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  

We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.  

My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named ""Best Mole"" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!  

Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!   

Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old.",1
"I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd. They really suck.

I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home, froze two and cooked one. It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.

I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.

Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.

And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.

They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! 

I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty ""I don't care"" attitude.

I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!

The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the ""questionable meat"" instead of throwing it out!  

I am still nauseous from the smell, sight and from touching all that gray, rotting gross stuff. BLEECH!!! I think I ate that in the last one!",0
"This is a club -- not a lounge, or supper club.

I was drugged and dumped here by friends a few months ago (Fri, around 10pm)...

It is too loud, too packed, and drinks cost too much. I am certainly not one of the ""beautiful people"" who belongs here...

Good luck!",0
"This restaurant has the best Italian food I have ever ate in my life!!! Definitely one of the best restaurants in AZ. I had the sautéed calamari for an appetizer, and an amazing dish for dinner with red snapper and pasta. Their bread also melts in your mouth. Blown away by the service. Gilda was my server, and she was amazing. Everyone was super nice, professional, courteous, and sooooooo hospitable. I've never had service this good at a restaurant other than at Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson. SERIOUSLY. AMAAAAAZING restaurant!!!!!",1
House special chicken is a must. This is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good! Never have had to wait for a table. The banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too. I give it 5 stars because of the huge selection. Pei Wei and PF Changs are ok but they have a limited menu. And a LARGE wait!,1
"What was Dunkin Donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10.  It used to be you couldn't decide which one to get, now you just have to settle for what they have.  This new and improved Dunkin Donuts is the worst.  I will return for coffee when I get the urge...but never for a donut!!  
Oh and another thing...my Dunkin Donuts used to have Baskin Robbins inside...that is gone too...again WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!",0
"Bad service, great food, awful coffee.",0
"We happened upon this place on Sunday. We had our 2 1/2 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry. We quickly ducked into Zinburger. All three of us had burgers. The kid's burger was huge and it came with fries. We also ordered the sweet potato fries. The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious. I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time I'll order those instead of fries. 

We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm. We told the waiter we were in a hurry. He was great, friendly and accommodating. We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there. Everyone was so nice. 

My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare. It still tasted yummy and I ate it. Had it been served that way to my hubby - he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger.",1
"5 stars isnt enough!!! I love the whole Briggs family. I have been going to this dentist since I was 8 years old and they have always been so amazing to me. I love that I walk in the door and they make me feel right at home. They are so sweet and everything in that place is actually super comforting.

They use the most high tech things I have ever seen, and its good to know I'm getting A+ care for my pearly whites. I recommend them to everyone I know!",1
"The food wasn't that good but that wasn't my main issue. It was the unwelcoming feeling I experienced. I will not be returning. The owner was friendly with everyone in the restaurant except my boyfriend and I. He would go table to table and talk to people and greet new customers and would acknowledge them when they left. The only acknowledgement I was received was an uncomfortable feeling of him staring at me when I wasn't looking, I'm assuming due to my abundance of tattoos. I felt judged and will not recommend this place to my friends or will never return.",0
"My husband and I went tonight to teakwoods for the first time. We had a groupon. The place was packed.  Different football games going on tvs all over the place. I didn't mind, but my hubby was in heaven:)   Hostess told us every table was full except outside. So went outside, turned right around because I forgot about smokers, lol. 
   We waited about 1 min and the hostess asked us if we would mind sharing a table with another couple. We said sure.  There was 6 chairs  and 4 of us total so 2 empties inbetween us. It was same as if we had our own table. Worked out great:)

 We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings- Delish!!!!! Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill. We Loved them!
I ordered a southern thang burger - my  hubby got a Teaks touch ém all. They were huge!  We each ended up taking half home.  Not just huge but tasty. I loved mine.    We decided to pay and use the groupon another time to ensure we would remember to come back:)

Great place- waitress nice and friendly, good food- we will eat there again!",1
"OOOOOWWWEEEE!! Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!! If not what are you waiting for!  They are the BOMB Diggity!

I don't know why I haven't updated my review either, so here I go! 


The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when you're no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends that's the heat I love!!


Luv me some wings from ATL!",1
This location has closed.  Went by today and found an empty restaurant.,1
"Loved this place since it open but they have changed their menu up a little and it seems they have cut corners and products out of there repartee.  The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size I've grown accustom to at the ""WBC"" and they've discontinued making their bread salad. (Very disappointing)  I will be back but with fewer expectations I guess.

I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money.  I don't need a refund... this is not what Yelp is about, but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews.  After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was.  The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich, it was good but I like SPICY!!!  I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce.  The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that I've enjoyed in the past.   

This type of service is what makes a customer for life.",1
"What can I say ?  This is awesome.  I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars, just like this place.  Great variety, great coffee, fresh donuts.  The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough.  Its very fluffy and its done just right.  

Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and ""old"" when they have been sitting for a while.  For some reason, the Bosa donuts dun get too hard, even after U buy and drive for like 1/2 hour home.  I know its not located in the best part of town, but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru.  They accept credit cards and discover :)",1
"Asi-Asi ,Menza-Menza,Comme ci Comme ca...you get the jist .

So -so ..(a solid so-so ).

He liked the taco's ,i liked the steak salad ( it had a nice little kick to it) Service was good.The atmosphere just wasn't my cup of tea ,that said ,i can see why some people like it here .Drinks were solid,menu was decent .

Good place to get hammered ,I suppose.

I had a Pinneapple mind eraser that was ......",0
"Every time I go in this place it's always a great experience.  My wife and I have been going to Lucille's pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months.  Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.  If you're on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning.

The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed.

Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac 'N Cheese as your side.  You will thank me later.

Q",1
"just wanted to chime in & say that this place is so vegetarian-UN-friendly it's not even funny. I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno, which was just about the only meatless item on the menu, short of a fucking cheese crisp.

it wasn't terrible, but this place is really just all kinds of lame. service was mediocre, food was mediocre. with as many awesome & authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley, there's no reason on earth to come back, except MAYBE to try a mango margarita.",0
"I've fequented here often enough to know that all the majority of the games here are all those ticket games and little claw type games. I come to hang out with friends and play some games. I can in on tuesday night around 6pm and thought to have dinner there since I had a coupon for the place. I really didn't care about price at the time with the coupon.

 After being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine. After we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time. When the waitress finally returned I had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well. My drink was empty so I would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but I caught her before she left. My boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from 6pm to 9pm.

We had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time. It wasn't for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well. It was as if they closed the place down and just left us. After the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her. The plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them...kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but I guess I shouldn't be so subtle next time. 

The food was ok at best. Nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if I had to pay full price for what I got if that waitress had left us like she did and I didn't frequent the games I would've walked out. Probably wouldn't notice. 

All in all go for the games if anything else. The games are even ok that is IF they are running. Sometimes I come in and games are off or not working. This is just a place that is convienent for myself and friends to meet up.",0
"Cute place!  Nice drive-thru window.  Adorable, really.  Nice patio-dining/lounging.  Noise-level inside was a little loud, but there were eight people, six of w/c were talkative yelpers (ha!), plus Kyle and Chad, owners of D'lish (who were, btw, easy on the eyes... a great asset for any business!).

One special request- please offer Maya Chai!  While Oregon Chai tastes OK, I'm allergic (I suspect there are ""natural flavors"" involved), and organic Maya Chai is multiple-times better (and, most importantly, I don't recall feeling negative effects after)!

Great spot to unwind and rejuvenate.  Will come back soon to try the food!",0
"I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.

The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll I've eaten.

Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.  I don't get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.

The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food.",0
"Great place for happy hour and drinks.  Really can't beat pints at $2.50, good long happy hour 7 days a week.  The sandwiches are all good, the salads make great sides instead of the chips and the tiny cherry sized tomatoes are to die for whether you get it on the bruchetta or cheese board plate.  Thursday late happy hour gets pretty busy and so does friday late afternoon into late evening.  Saturday night it picks up after happy hour ends.  Wish they had burgers and fries like the Living Room in downtown Phoenix.",1
"Good Indian food not great.  Came in on a Saturday night, was craving Indian.  Not busy at all.  (Never a great sign).  The samosas were the best in town, piping hot with a great filling that was redolent of spicies and not super mild like some other restaurants.  The lamb korma and chicken tikka masala were okay.  For some reason it didn't pop for me.  It had nothing to do with the spiciness level, it was just missing that extra pop you get from a truly great curry.  I don't know if the spices hadn't been freshly toasted, or if it was lacking a crucial pinch of love that day, but I wasn't feeling it.  I left full but not quite satiated of my Indian food fix.  And the quest for the best chicken tikka masala in town continues....(oh I should mention the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, the service good, but the prices a little steep for my taste)",0
"Buffet is great, Good Selection of food even for me the picky Vegetarian. Naan tastes great, choice of plain or Garlic Naan. Food generally tastes good. Rating on Buffet alone, I would have given 4 stars.

However I might not return there for Dinner or Take-out.

Dinner Entries are priced well above $10,  and generally use frozen vegetables (Crinkle cut carrots anyone, god I hate those) 

The last time I ordered take out, the quantity of my dishes was about half of what I got the previous time. (Fine, Can I pay you a little less than the bill?) and the food tasted sub-par and my naan was burnt. For this they get only 1 star.

Good place for the lunch buffet.",0
"The Menu here is great.  So much to choose from and its always good.  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.  The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome.  I've also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit",1
"The service here is wonderful. Let me start by saying that, our waitress (I'm mad I didn't remember her name) waited on us on the patio. She was so nice and our friend can be a little overwhelming and has a strange sense of humor. She made sure everything we wanted we got. Even modified the desert special so we could have a hybrid of the white chocolate chip ice cream and a brownie dessert. My filet was wonderful and at a great price of 24 bucks... Me living in san francisco where filet's cost 40 bucks a piece this was up to par. The corn salad is also worth mentioning, wonderful flavors. Anyway, I could have been happy with many items on their menu... Also, get the dragonberry lemonade it is on their specialty drinklist and is great on a hot day!!!",1
"I wanted to check this place out as I had got my mother in law a gift certificate for here...  It is what appears to be an old farmhouse that was left standing in the middle of Scottsdale busy city life..  The inside is very charming, like stepping into someone's home with all the good smells of cooking.  We didn't make reservations and since it was a Sunday, knew we were pushing it, especially with the after church crowds.  But as luck should have it, was able to sit outdoors and was such a nice sunny day, was great.   I had the Chicken, wild mushroom and leeks crepe..was that ever heavenly!  My husband the strawberry chicken salad, which he also enjoyed..  One thing that drew my attention was that there were a lot of women senior citizens...very well dressed ones...obviously part of the Scottsdale upper crust..I think we were the youngest ones in there.. Next time I'm back in Scottsdale will have to go back..",1
"My croissant with ham, eggs & swiss this morning was fabulous & came with a bonus brownie (saved for later & was very yummy too!) & orange juice
Please try the iced tea!! The way the owner makes it is amazing & like nothing I've tried!  He mixes a kind of apple cider that they make on-site with fresh mint.
Everything is made from scratch!  I love this and do not mind to wait a couple of minutes for beautifully personally made for me food!
Even hummus is made from scratch from dried chickpeas.
I was very pleased & my belly was full!",1
"Mmmmmm...why did I wait so long to try this????  Unbelievable pizza!!!!!!!!!!  I would give 5 stars, bjt the service was...well, not great.  Its ok, we all have off days.  We'll be back!!!!",1
"Is it worth the trip for a Chirico and Egg sandwich from Chaka Chaka, heck yes!!!!",1
"I must have looked like a poor, ugly person the other day bc seriously NO ONE helped me. no one even said hi. I was in there for an hour too. 

I decided not to buy anything bc the service was so bad. 

this is a little bit like OJ's ""i didnt kill my wife, but if I did this is how I would do it"" in that if someone had helped me I would have bought 6 place settings- mats, chargers, napkins and napkin rings. I also would have bought several drapery panels. 

but no way was I going to spend that much money at a place that couldn't even say hello or ask a girl carrying around a ton of place settings if she needed help. 

so i just set everything I had gathered up over the hour in a pile and left. you're welcome employees, hope you had fun putting everything away. i also hope they work on commission and are regretting not saying hi to me.",0
"Been twice. Authentic, high quality & great price for what you get. Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best!! Loved the decor. Orchata tasted fresh, which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants.",1
"I had a date in January here with Jen.  We got the meat pizza, which was great.  I thought our date was pretty good, but wasn't quite up to the hype of our texting and online chatting.  She was very talkative and definitely an adventurous extrovert.  She lived in New York (Appropriate NYPD PIzza topic) for a few years to be close to theater, but moved back to Arizona because of lack of money.  It was another unsuccessful first date, not leading to a second date.  Overall, I recommend the pizza and the service was excellent.",1
"I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did. We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.

Unfortunately, they had sold out of the oysters, but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish, then softshell crab roll, rainbow roll, and the green mussels. The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery ""rub,"" the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab, and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner. 

The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled, and the food came out a dish at a time, giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish. At other sushi joints, I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!). This was a happy medium for me. The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.

My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the bar...but that's what you get in Scottsdale.",1
"Wow... After eating sushi from across the nation i have to say Scottsdale's Geisha A Go Go has surprised me for an ultimate low. Andrew, the manager, reassured us that we had something wrong with our taste buds for not tasting how fresh the fish was here. Insulting to assume. Not recommended!!!!",0
"What happened to this place?  The first time I went about a year ago, both the food and service were great.

Second time, last May, I ordered the same dish and it was horrible.  Drowning in sauce.  But, at least the service was decent.

Just went a third time and it will be my last.  Both the food and service were horrible.  Went for lunch, sat inside and it wasn't very busy.  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things, like taking our order to start.  

Then, even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.  In the meantime, I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area, which is open, so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins.

My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.  This is a shame, especially because there aren't many places in Phx that have vegan choices, but for the price you pay, I would expect a lot more.",0
Went to Cracker Barrel twice while vacationing at our home in Litchfield Park.  All the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also.  I highly recommend their pancakes.,1
"WOW!  Great donuts!  Honestly you can't eat just one!  I loved the plain glazed and the old-fashioned!  Not like the franchise donut shops, these have the real bakery taste!",1
"I agree with Chris L.; I was disappointed with the cafe.  Granted, I was looking for a college-type coffeehouse where I could grade papers, and this place just didn't have that sort of lounge-y feel that even certain Starbuck$$ have.  There was no background music being played, and even with my ipod/headphones on, I was distracted by nearby conversations.  I got much more work done at 3 Roots near campus.",0
"The new location is big, open, and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner. But that's just aesthetics, I realize.

The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.

I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so. 

Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.

EAT HERE. And ask for twice the spicy you would normally. The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium.",1
"i don't say, too many prayers
saint or sinner, i don't care
which is worse, which is better
corinthians, apostles' letters
don't read the bible, preach the word
no born again, but i have heard
of saintly acts, around this town
the volunteers, each morning bound
unselfishly, they give their time
a day, an hour,  can remind
you how, sometimes, the way things go
to count your blessings, never know
hungry, homeless, most are blessed
St Mary's cares, for all the rest
feeding famished, forty years
donations come, from far and near
warehoused, sorted, then sent out
deserving families, who, no doubt
would otherwise, just not be fed
but gratefully, they go to bed 
with bellies full and filled with hope
thanks to St Mary's, most can cope
with unemployment, cost of gas
mounting bills and dwindling cash
humbly they come, take what they need
a box or two, enough to feed 
their families, ease their malaise
for weeks, or just, a couple days
so volunteer, you wont regret
it's what you give, not what you get    
easy to say, you could, or should
but doing good, will do you good
we just showed up, put us to work
boxes of apples, stand and sort
with kids from SARRC, autistic, all

joked and laughed, sacked and hauled

"Baiz Market is a ""Mediterranean"" type restaurant, or ""Arabic"" type food. Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.

This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).

I just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh.

If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.

I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.

I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If you're weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting.",1
"They are the best!  99% of my pain in my back is gone, thanks to Patrick O'Brien and assistant Joshua.

Bonnie Wills",1
"Again, it's a bit unfair of me to rate this restaurant because I'm from San Jose/Cupertino but I'm gonna do it anyway.

So, being from San Jose/Cupertino, I've had me some good Chinese food and even better dim sum. So when the Boyfriend brought me here, I was expecting something decent, but not anything too authentic.

This place was fairly decent and authentic! It has the Asian ladies and their dim sum carts. It has the OG dim sum dishes. It even has the authentic less than mediocre Asian service. 

The only disappointment is that this place is a bit dirty and ragged-y looking. And the vegetable dishes are minimal. In fact, I had to order a veg dish off the menu because they didn't have any dim sum veg dishes and it cost $13! Bleh.",0
"I have been to every ballpark in the Cactus League and know my way around them all.  This is, by far, the best facility in all of Spring Training (that includes the Florida parks).  Granted, I am a Dodger fan and we get it better than the 'Sox fans do, but it is still amazing.

Camelback Ranch is the brand new, state of the art, spring training facility for the Dodgers and White Sox.  The Sox moved from Tucson because Tucson is the literally SO bad that even people from CHICAGO won't stay there.  The park is located just south of the Glendale Airport and pretty much only has one way in or out - 111th Ave.  You can avoid Camelback Rd by taking Indian School to 111th and then just drive into the stadium.

The grounds feature 13 practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields.  While the White Sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public, the Dodgers' are wide open and inviting.  Players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans.  

The field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive.  Not only do they have a full Jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out $90 per game.  That price gets you seats behind home, access to unlimited food, wine, beer, soda, and sweets.  It also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off.  It sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money.

The grass seats have a great slope to them (much like Scottsdale) and the seat aisles are wide.  The food selection is lacking without Dodger Dogs, however.  The stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that Maryvale and Peoria feature.  

A great stadium and surely one to visit every March.",1
"I so wanted to love this place. I'd heard great things about the food, love the concept and was looking forward to a wonderful experience. What a disappointment. 

We were seated within 20 minutes or so of arrival, which was great considering the crowd. It was nice to have somewhere to walk around, and we were able to serve ourselves tea and coffee while we waited. 

Once seated, however, it took 20 minutes for anyone to take our order, and another 45 for the food to come. Our food arrived cold. Husband and I both ordered eggs ""over medium;"" mine were runny and undercooked, his were hard and scaly. ""Home fries"" were a mound of mushy, under-seasoned potatoes. We were offered jam when the food came, but the waitress never returned with it. My husband asked one of the other staff if they had any jam, received a curt, ""yes"" as a reply, but they didn't offer to help in any way. 

For the prices (average $10 plus $2.25 for a self-serve drink), I can think of many places I'd rather spend my dining dollars. Yes, the grounds are lovely and I like that most of the food is from local suppliers (which does not mean it was raised on THIS farm, BTW), but there are many lovely patios in Phoenix with much better food and service.",0
"We were going to movies when the skies opened up.  

That is when we first noticed we needed new windshield wiper blades.

Kinda dumb, right?  But, the only time we use them here in the Valley is after a car wash?  Think about it.  

So we stopped at this location on Northsight, next to former site of ""Al's Beef"" which is now closed.  The folks who work there stopped me as I walked in and asked for the make and model of my car.  Within ten seconds we were over to the aisle and had the correct blades for our car.  WOW!  What a great group!

A funny aside.  As we left, I started taking out one of the blades and began throwing away the plastic and cardboard in the outside trash bin.  Another shocker.  It was filled to capacity with old blades.  Great minds, Eh?",0
"I stayed here with a group of friends for a 1/2 marathon that we were all registered in.  The room that I had faced the In and Out burger but I didn't hear anything.  The pool area is small but if you want a bit of sun I think the best place is in the small grassy area behind the HUGE wicker chair.  Grab a lawnchair or toss a towel down and enjoy.  
The biggest complaint I had was that the Bar didn't open until 5 p.m.  Early, I know but it was my weekend!
The room itself was modern and clean. 
The bathroom was nice, and so were the complimentary magazines.",1
"If you haven't been to this place - go! Seriously. It's amazing. It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And it's cheap!

Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.
Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.

Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!
The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.
I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register.
I can't recommend this place enough!",1
It seems like there is not as much value for your dollar at Gold Medal.  We had been there since the new school opened but decided to move on.  We got a 'can't we get you to stay' call which felt like desperation on their part.  My daughter enjoyed her lessons but her favorite teacher left (as most do) and the cost was not worth it anymore.  I would not recommend them to my friends.,0
"Just because i feel like doing something different. :P
i'm just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell...

Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
I said the truth is here the truth is here

I want more
Give me more
We want more
God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
We want more
I want more and more and more
I want more
We need more
I want more
God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

[Verse 1:]
I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on
And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone
I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
It's got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
I'm a rebel in my own right
Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it I'm exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be

[Chorus: x2]
I want more
We need more
I want, god damn it I'm back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

I said the truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is

[Verse 2:]
Not nearly a single solitary soul
Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold
Got one lone reason to go on breathing
Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain
Little child running wild striped to the raw veins
Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
Not bought and sold, not all controlled
Bring a little fire when the world get cold
Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold
People need more freedom
Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading
I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break
Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake
I demand you start listening to the crowd
If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground

[Chorus x2]

I said the truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is


the atmosphere is pretty hot here too..exposed brick always makes me Yelp!",1
"The lanes and equipment are all new which is great, and half the alley have wonderful couch seating instead of the typical plastic chairs. The only problem is that it gets very crowded, despite having 44 lanes!! Also, their weekend rates are pretty pricey - I can't blame them since the market bears the price, but three games can cost almost $20 per person with shoes, which means a family of four will walk out  spending almost $100 if you get some food and drinks. YIKES!",1
Very VERY average. Actually disappointed in the braciole. Kelsey with the pretty smile and form fitting shorts would probably make me think about going back and trying something different.,0
"Okay, I have been to DryBar on multiple occassions and have been pleased once, maybe twice, but it wasn't horrible.  Unfortunately, the day of my wedding was horrible.  My fault that I didn't go in for a practice run, BUT I was assured by their ANSWERING SERVICE that I would get ""one of their best,"" because that's who they send out.  The lady that came to our hotel room to do our (my mom and me) hair was rude and not talented.  She barely spoke and when she did it was defensive and not from a place of yes.  When a bridesmaid (who went to DryBar to get her hair done and wasn't satisfied) agreed with me that my hair style should be fixed, the stylist looked at her phone and said,""well, what time is it?"" as she argued with us that she couldn't do anything else with my hair because it's fine.  We were like ""we don't care what time it is, it's my wedding, and I will pay you whatever it takes to get my hair looking the way I want it.""  My mom hated her hair, took pictures to send to DryBar and then fixed it herself.  The problem with getting a quick solution is that they have an answering service which makes problem solving an issue, especially when you have limited time and makes scheduling a large group complicated.  Again, I've been happy once or twice, they have a few good stylists and a lot of very mediocre ones.  I think I'll try some of the other blowdry bars in town.",0
"Being new to the Phoenix area we were looking forward to finding a Thai restaurant, since we eat Thai fairly often. Going off of the Yelp reviews, we decided to try Swaddee. We ordered the Tom Ka soup with tofu instead of chicken, and the Pad See-ew with soft tofu, and the veggie rolls (to go). The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than we're used to, which was a nice surprise. The Tom Ka soup was a little more sour than we're used to, but overall still tasty. However, it was almost $11 which we felt was about double what it should have cost. The Pad See-ew was the most disappointing part of the meal. The flavor was fine, nothing special but not bad. However, it was pretty dry and sticky, like you'd expect from a cheap college Thai take-out joint.

Overall nothing really stood out. We had high hopes since the meals were on the pricey end for take-out, but we've had far better Thai for half the price. We'll keep looking for a better Thai place to become our local go-to!",0
"A nice place to watch a game... nice that it is open enough that you can keep an eye on the game while you survey your many dining alternatives.

I also they let some natural sunlight and keep the place cool at the same time.

Anyway I don't have a good reason to give this place one star, or five stars, hence three stars.",0
"I've always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats.  I used to say, ""You know what would be the best theater?  AMC experience, with Harkins seats..""

Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  I love this place.  It's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  Not to mention an IMAX.  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.

Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get.

Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.

Nice work AMC on making a great theater!!

Ohhh big big big heads up.  Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money.   that's probably the draw back.  I'll still give you 5 stars.",1
"Came here for breakfast yesterday, it had been years since I have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service.  Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.",1
I have gone here quite a few times. I like having a diner close by for breakfast and newspaper reading. But this one is always short staffed. And there doesn't seem to be much management around to smooth things out. Food is usually good but staff always seems stressed out. May be due to serving hoards of poor tipping elderly.,0
"I've been here twice...the first time was driven by a rumor that they made their own root beer.  I'm a sucker for homemade root beer, so I had high hopes that this place would become a favorite.  My husband and I were so excited when these huge glasses of RB hit the table!!  And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said ""WTF???""  Worst RB EVER!

What the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the ""fine print"" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  It's made with Stevia NOT sugar...I'm sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If I'm going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is ""natural"" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway).

After the root beer debacle, it didn't get better.  The food was meh...service was not so great (there were moments of ""is she ever coming back???"").  I'd say, go here for the beer, sans root, but that's about it.  Otherwise, skip this place and drive out to Four Peaks...you'll be happier all around.",0
"I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.

When my salmon dish came out I said to my self ""WHAT in the hell?"" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.

Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again ""What in the HELL?""  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.

The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre.",0
"Ladies in the flooring section are very knowledgeable and helpful.  Though I do think they are a bit understaffed, they were gracious and friendly.  Fairly large in stock flooring section compared to other stores.",1
"It is sometimes difficult to start out busy and maintain great standards from the beginning.  The Parlor seems to be nailing it.  Hip yet comfortable decor.   Very creative design, and I loved he subtle yet present homage to the former tenant Salon de Venus.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm and sincere smile, and that same enthusiasm was felt by every single staff member we encountered.  
Ah the food!  Fresh ingredients, a great light pizza crust, and an original beet salad all  had us raving.   The only minor picky foody issue was the Nectarine Crustada for dessert was luke warm at best, would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream.  

But why nit pic?  This place is a big hit, from the moment you walk past the fresh herb and vegetable garden,  to the fantastic staff and the  savory food, this place is already on my regular rotation.",1
"What a dream come true to traipse into this store with my toddler girl and my husband. The store is filled, ceiling to floor, with all varieties of toys for all age groups. Shelves upon shelves of brands and models you've likely never seen if your main toy-shopping stomping grounds are Toys R Us or Walmart. The store's management clearly has a relaxed attitude about children playing in the store -- toys are sprawled across the store,  ready for the next child's little hands. Yet, it didn't feel messy in there. The aisles are wide and smooth. The store is organized into various zones. (Dolls, science, blocks, books, baby, etc.)  This is an absolute oasis in suburbia land where you're always hard-pressed to find non-chain stores.",1
"This is my first review on Yelp so here you go...

I love Yasu!!  This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix.  I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints.  

You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so good

Nigiri/sashimi are a must.  They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.  

Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!  

Love this place!!",1
"I stayed here for work and had some meetings in the area which made the location very convenient for me. I just hopped in my car and was at my office 5 minutes later.

The hotel seemed pretty new-ish and there were free cookies at check in. There is also a restaurant downstairs and a gym if you're into that sort of thing. My room was clean and well kept.  My only minor complaint about the room would be that the air conditioning is super loud!

There are a couple of restaurants right outside, but they close pretty early. Other than that there isn't too much close by, but if you drive up the street a few blocks to Happy Valley, you can find every big box store and chain restaurant imaginable.",1
I heart Harkins. Have for years. Love the loyalty cups & t's.,1
"Fresh & Easy is the US subsidiary of UK based grocer Tesco who entered the American market in 2007.  I know Tesco really well and they are smart business folks who know their market.  Fresh & Easy has been opening stores all over the Phoenix area and have been using $20 and $10 coupons to build market share.  I give them a lot of credit for doing this.

I also have been shopping here for a long time and appreciate their eye on packaging food items for the busy consumer.  One of my favorites is their rosemary focaccia bread dough.  I've made it at home, but Fresh & Easy make it ohhh so easy when I'm tired and it's 6:45.

BTW, thanks for the Hybrid parking space!",1
"We chose this place for breakfast this morning because of the wonderful reviews on yelp.  I was certain it was going to be one of my new favorite places. 

We entered into a brightly painted orange restaurant and stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes waiting for the hostess to finish flirting with the server and notice us.  She clearly didn't want to be there and could care less where we sat, so opted for the table in the window.  

We sat and waited and waited and waited.  Tables that were sat after us already had their drinks and they were not busy.  Finally I tried to get the attention of the hostess who was standing half asleep at the hostess stand, mouth open wide, eyes half closed.  A few minutes later we finally had a server.

Our server was not very friendly.  I don't even think she said good morning.  We ordered.  Tables sat after us already got their food and we finally got our drinks.  She bought out 2 cups of coffee, but I did not order coffee so I made her take that back. 

Our food finally arrived.  We ordered french toast which came with strawberries, bananas and a cinnamon sauce, eggs benedict with crab cakes and two orders of country potatoes. 

Breakfast was pretty good.  I enjoyed my crab cake and the cinnamon sauce on the french toast was a nice added touch.  The potatoes were not good, they had WAY too much pepper on them, I couldn't even eat them.  Gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup.

We never saw our server again.  We got a water refilled after we finished our meal.  AND THE WAIT BEGAN.  We waited and waited and waited for our check.  Tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food.  We never saw our waitress. I guess we were her only table, if not I felt bad for her other tables as well. 

Finally some guy brought us our check and tried to drop it off and run, I said WAIT and gave him my card and said, ""If I don't give this to you now it may be 20 more minutes before we see someone again""

Because I didn't look at the bill first when he brought it back I didn't notice until after I paid that they charged me $12.05 for the eggs benedict when their menu actually said $10.50.  I didn't say anything...  I just left a sad tip.

We were there for OVER an hour, they had lots of empty tables, and we only saw our server once.

Gary and I always over tip, because he and his family owned restaurants in the Valley for 35 years.  He has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables.  We know that when food comes out wrong, it's probably not the servers fault, and things happen, so we still tip well.  TODAY, I felt like we were invisible and I have no idea where our server disappeared to for the hour.  

We drove by Over Easy, La Grande Orange and IHOP to try this place.  We probably will not be back... unless we decide to give it a second try on jazz night... I do love jazz.",0
"Oh dang! This place is GOOD. I am in love with the carnitas burrito, and the employees are so nice and make some damn good food. If you're in the area and don't want Taco Bell then GO HERE! They also give you chips, and the chips and salsa are pretty legit. Try not to stuff yourself with the chips though, cause the foods the real winner here. I will be back, and have been back many many times since my first experience. Why only 4 stars you ask? The breakfast burrito was just a-okay, I would much rather get a breakfast burrito elsewhere but the regular burritos are the bomb diggity! ;)",1
I know this is going to be super girly but I love the peach beer at Four Peaks and the beer battered fries are amazing.,0
"This review is composed as a companion piece to the other positives on this page, so please read those for details I won't repeat.
   I think Jason B.'s comments most accurately mirror my overall feel for this place. And, while I find Nick S.'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn't be entirely dismissed either.
   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony's operates on the ""European Standard"". So ,if you've ever been, you know. If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to ""pass"" on visiting Tony's. I'd assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we're all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters. Do you do calamari, or not?
   If you're of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience. I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service. Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask. Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto.
   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry. Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn't diminish the faded, festive charm in the least. Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me. See the vintage ('50's?) black and white photo of Elvis w/some past friend or relation. Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of '09.
   I admit that not everything at Tony's is superfine, or to everyone's particular taste. I don't especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced. I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown. I've found outdated items at AJ's, Fry's, and  almost everywhere else.  It happens.
   If you're up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide. I ""second"" the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @$2.15 is a bargain. (compared to $7 at Aiello's restaurant on Central, which I haven't tried.)
   Another bargain here is the bulk olives. While I'm not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome. With jumbo plain greens @$3.50lb., and Greeks priced at the upper end of $5.49lb., you can pay $11 and up for the same thing elsewhere. Let the Snoot in you decide.

   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives.
They're black. They're ripe. They're wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny. They're salty,(very) not sour. They're earthy, deeply rich, and complex. They're meaty, satisfying, and delicious. They're addicting. They're sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic. They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats. They're seaspray and sunshine; they're sublime. And they're $4.49. Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you're home.. Where the heart is... OR, you can eat them like candy. Try at least ONE in your lifetime.
   Sadly, Tony's skips the minced garlic more often than not. If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home. Makes a world of difference.",1
"I absolutely love Chompies! It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.

They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.

I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well. 

Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.

Chompies is the best!",1
"Never disappointed with this place!

Get the brisket, get the pork. Get the beans. They're bangin'!!!!!! The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too. The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans. Do NOT skip the beans. Trust me. 

I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right. Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did. Makes for great leftovers. Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too. Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good. 

Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food. It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy. I've never actually dined-in at this place. I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window. They are pretty fast.

My future father-in-law wants me to choose Joe's to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner? Not really, but Joe's is excellent, and we're heading toward a laid-back wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many out-of-town family and friends. I am sure they will all love Joe's and I can't wait for them to try it!",1
"Over the last 3 years we've lived in the area, this place has changed 4 times.  First Uncle Bear's, then Tio Oso's, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now it's TC's Pub & Grub.  The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time). 

The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up).  The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinal's game!), but still got a good table close to a TV.  

Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc.  Still, nice enough and very attentive.

We ordered wings (""medium"" but they were spicy!) and their ""ugly"" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives.  The wings, very good, I would get them again.  Pizza, I wouldn't order it again if someone paid me.  The ""ugly"" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings.  It was pretty horrible honestly.  The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option.  Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza.  I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust.

All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and I'm looking forward to trying their other menu options. 

p.s. text TCSPUB to 411247 and they'll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft. Score! (I'm a sucker for a deal)  Cheers!",1
"The restaurant has 6 tables which make it possible for you to eat-in, but this place is definitely more suited towards take out or delivery.  Just don't expect service if you eat-in.  You order at a counter and if you choose to eat-in, you will get your soup in a take out container, eat on paper plates and styrofoam cups, but get your entrees served on platters.

The house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies, as well as chicken, pork, and shrimp pieces.  However, one key ingredient was missing - won tons!

General Tso's chicken was fried and served with broccoli and sufficient sauce.  The Mongolian beef was more Mongolian and less beef.

Overall the food was OK, except for the disappointment of the missing wontons, and I would probably consider this place again for delivery.",0
"Fancy ladies with a few gays sprinkled in. This is NM Cafe!

Popovers. Prawn and avocado salad. Glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

Make your reservation under Candy Spelling's name. You will get the BEST table. 

Works every time.",1
One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.,1
Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.,1
"The decor and ambience was very pleasant.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.   Granted, it was a Monday night and my wife and I were only one of three parties in the restaurant. 

  We ordered the hot and sour soup, the puu puu platter (sp?), chicken chow mein, and the curry chicken.  Everything was terrific.  The hot and sour soup surprised me - I'm not normally a very big soup fan but I thoroughly enjoyed it both at the restaurant and as left-overs the next day.     The portions of all of the orders were very big.  We had left-overs for three additional meals.",1
"Very impressed! $5 pitcher until 5pm, and excellent healthy food at a good value. Free valet parking.  I look forward to coming back.",1
"First time here--glad we came!  Free chips and salsa (always a great start to a Mexican meal!).  Hubby and I split the chicken fajitas, which were very tasty!  Good-sized portion with lots of red bell peppers, which we like. Served with side of rice and beans, guac, sour cream, and pico de gallo.  We each ate our fill and still had enough for a take-home 'fajita burrito' :D",1
"Wow, I am kinda suprised by the recent reviews of this place. My girlfriend loves this place and has been going for the past 5+ years. She would probably give it 5 stars. I really like this place, the atmosphere, we always get great service. The food is really, really good and the prices aren't bad. Sometimes, very crowded, but haven't ever waited too long. We love going back and can't wait till our next visit.",1
"Nice atmosphere, especially outside patio.  Strange to see some people dressed gym casual on a Friday night, as well as some kids.  They poured Chimay into a pilsner glass, so bad marks for that.  Falaffel appetizer was nice, but Falaffel itself was too finely ground and flavorless.  Salads were really outstanding.  Enchiladas, also, were very good.  Thai short ribs were pretty good as well.  Great dessert options.  Overall pricey, but fair.",1
"Let's face it, junk is the antithesis of glamorous.  When you've got a big pile of crap you need hauled away, any guy with a truck will do, right?

WRONG.  You want someone that will be on time, is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after they've picked everything up, is polite and fluent in English, thinks of value-added services like emptying your trash bin, and represents a local business that you can patronize.

Junk Guys ticked all these boxes for me.  THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold.  I'd highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company.  So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys - you'll thank me!",1
"Great place for cheap drinks! 
Everybody knows each other and you can becom part of the Playa family quick :)
Sharen ( the owner ) is very friendly and nice and she will remember your name and what you drink after one visit.

Great place to watch games !",1
"Like anyone else with good taste, I think this place was better when it was called ""The Library"". IDK when their specials are, but the first jager bomb was $2 on a Tuesday night, and I'll love them forever just on that alone. There's plenty of space to sit throughout the bar, a restroom attendant, and usually a DJ.

It reminds me of sports bars you find everywhere in Glendale, just with a younger crowd.",0
"This is by far my favourite department store, hands down. I have had nothing but perfect experiences in this store, without exception, no matter what department I'm in. The shoe SA's will bend over backwards to help you find a specific shoe, and the staff will even go so far as to send out hand-written thank you cards to your home address after you make a purchase - big or small. Tim & Anthony in the shoe salon are fabulous beyond words! 

I am not completely sure that I understand why people complain about the amount of merchandise on the floor or the lack of crowds in this store. Frankly, I would rather not be bombarded with merchandise and other people. One of the things I love the most about Barney's is not only the prompt attention of SA's, but the fact that they aren't rushing around trying to help 35 people at once. The SA's at Barney's are incredibly friendly and will stop to have an actual conversation, regardless or whether you are purchasing something or not. I have also never experienced a ""high pressure"" sale situation here.

All in all, Barneys is pricey, and there is no getting around it. But, um, so is Neiman's and that place is a crock. Anywhere that ONLY accepts American Express or their charge card and then treats you like scum if you aren't carrying neither is no place that I want to spend my hard earned dollars. Yay Barneys!",1
"After hearing all of the hype on diners, drive in and dives and reading the yelp ratings, we decided to try it.  We waited over 30 minutes  for a table.  The place is small and outside of a dungy motel.  The service was extremely fast once you got in the door and the waitstaff are very friendly.  I had a waffle and it was good but nothing memorable.  My partner had an omelette with portguese sausage that he loved.  The hash browns were so buttery and they were good.  

I wouldn't make a special trip back.",0
"Pleasantly surprised about the cleaniness of the location, the friendliness of the baristas and just the overall atmosphere. Reminds me of a small town cafe with the general coffee condiments centered for easy access. Drinks were made to order and have never failed to keep satisfied! 

Just need to get a drive through and all will be perfecto!",1
"While I give the management props for honoring our gift certificate, even though our total rang up below the minimum price, the food was teh ick. 

I got the fish tacos. I understand the urge to make them unique, and different from the thousands of varieties of fish tacos available in the Valley. But this attempt was a huge miss. 

The tilapia tasted pretty muddy, even for tilapia. It was served with a really sweet, sticky, almost BBQ-style sauce. I was alternately pleased that it was so cloying that it almost covered the icky river flavor of the tilapia, and perplexed at this odd pairing. The avocados also had a funny, chemical flavor to them. Double-yuck.",0
"Cherry on Top is a rare example of design by market analysis committee, who couldn't decide on a unique concept so they decided to ""borrow"" from all of their competitors' styles, turning out at least as well as if not better than its individual inspirations.

The result provides convenient answers to the following frozen yogurt questions:
- Can't decide between tart and traditional? Why not both?
- Can't decide between standard or high-end sweet? Mix vanilla, taro, green tea, cheesecake (but only at your own risk.)
- Feeling constrained by four fit all sizes? $0.39/oz., cup weight subtracted.
- Wavering on the topping healthiness spectrum? Fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available.

The quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals (as long as one is not requiring the desert honey Sweet Republic tart variant) but, correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most patrons won't care about the slight dip, trading off for the flexibility of purchasing (only) as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying Hershey's-acclimated children with a Frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest Pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple.",0
"It's just like pizza bianco without the wait. This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10. This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for. 

If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here.",1
"Followed a Dr. that I respect to this practice and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. As a long time multi-four-footed caregiver, I have seen more than my share of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals. I know the drill and have seen more than one vacation be sucked in to the great black hole of ""well of course I want  to have the best care"". 

The first thing I noticed is that there is NO odor. It doesn't smell like there have been decades of animals paraded through the doors that feel the need to pee as soon as they enter the room... just in case this is their one last shot at leaving something behind. 

Then there is the overall feel of the place. The office I used to frequent always had a frenetic sort of feel to it. Files were lost, techs were running, the waiting room was packed with stressed out clients, etc. This office was peaceful. Whether is natural or contrived, I could care less. My dog picked up on it immediately and her normal ""OMG what are we doing HERE?!!"" behavior was replaced with something I've never witnessed in a vet office before. She was calm! 

It's clean! Except for the area around me that was covered in the undercoat that Zoe was stress releasing, there were no traces of other animals. 

The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I had a HUGE file that I was bringing in and they patiently sorted through the entire thing. While I was there for one of my pets, the receptionist offered to set all of them in my household up for me with ""Client Files"" so that I wouldn't have to be bothered in the future. I thought that was a wonderful, time-saving offer and in the event that I ever have to go with an emergency and am not able to focus on paperwork. 

Finally, I was in an examination room at the time of my appointment and waited less than 3 minutes for both the tech and the Dr. I was in an out under 1 hour and that my friends is superior service IMHO. 

I look forward to a long relationship with Palm Glen and will happily drive the 5 mile difference from my old vet, in order to ensure both my pets and I are treated well!",1
"Rarely crowded. 4 tables indoors, many more outdoors. Wifi is usually fast. Only downside is that it's next to a gas station, so the visuals out the window aren't exactly spectacular. But if you care about that, why are you in Scottsdale?",1
Omg! So good! So fresh! Great burger joint. Ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich with grilled onions. The steak was tender and perfectly pink. Husband ordered the Original with fries. The burger was juicy and a good size. The fries were perfectly seasoned and fresh. We split a drink. Total bill was a bit over $14. Not a bad dinner price. Place was empty when we got here at 9:00 on a Saturday night but quickly filled up. Great service and great food. We will make The Habit a habit!,1
"Every time going to this Best Buy I've had a good experience. The staff is extremely helpful, but not overbearing (constantly asking and asking to help like other Best Buys). They ask once, then give you your space. When you have a question, they're always nice and prompt to answer. Perfect customer service.

It gets better though. The most recent visit to this location I had bought a camera, and even with good reviews online, and the help of the BestBuy staff, I found out the audio on the camera was terrible. Just a problem with that model camera. We didn't know.

The next day I returned the camera with its plan, and had the easiest transition with customer service too get a different camera. Within 10 minutes I was in and out with a new and better camera, and didn't spend an extra dime. It was perfect, and the new camera is great! 

Just one of the many great experiences at this Best Buy. I would give this 5 stars, but the store itself is super tiny, so selection can be limited (the only drawback).",1
"For cheap pizza, it's as good as it gets. More selection than the other cheap pizza places, and the quality is way better.  The wings are delicious also, especially the Cajun flavor!!! If your looking for something like one of the big chains, then go there, but this is good for the money. If you want gourmet pizza, then go pay for it, don't look for it at the bargain places.  I paid $29 for an XL pizza with two toppings and 20 wings, and everyone was happy!  Just know that it's really fast pizza, but it's better than the other big guys!",0
"Duane is amazing!  Reliable, Responsive, Reasonably Priced, i simply can't reccomend him enough!  I've used him four separate times now and have been more than happy with each visit.  I won't call anyone else!",1
"Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with ""it's just how we do things"" and ""there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little"". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner ""really doesn't care"". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere.",0
"Excellent customer service, super clean, and the food's not bad at all.  Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy, but got NO mayo, was a little annoying.  But, for some reason, something told me to pick up some packets of mayo.  So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning.  That, and the sandwich was pretty yummo.  They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it.

I do not, however, recommend the chocolate chip cookie.  No bueno.",1
"Very nice place with extremely friendly staff.  The food was similar quality to other Mexican food places in the NW Valley....good but not spectacular.   Very good portions for the price.  

I don't live close by but will certainly go back when I am in the area.",1
"This place is very off-the-beaten-track, I'm sure most people overlook it....I only came across it whilst searching online for somewhere 'different' to eat...and when I came across the review on the Phoenix New Times website(http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-02-10/dining/sultans-of-shish/), I knew this was it...

I only docked a star for the (extremely) sparse decor and atmosphere...this place could have been any other type of business with just a change of sign and omission of tables...

anyway, the food was great! my fiance ordered skewers of beef and lamb(I'm not too keen on lamb, but the beef was tender and succulent...very well spiced!)...I had a cucumber salad(diced, along with onions and parsley, and soaked in vinegar-lemon juice), which enchanted me so much that I created my own version at home and make it every time I feel like doing a bit of dicing(msg me for the recipe--it's a bit death-breathy and labor-intensive but delicious!)...

and, during dessert, I could see why Samarkand was voted 'Best Tea in Phoenix'...the black tea was easily the best I've ever had(besides a special brand of blue ginger tea I make a point to keep my cabinet stocked with)...it was strong and rich...absolutely incredible!

definitely make it a point to search this place out--it's worth the effort!",1
"I was looking for a place close to where I live for eyebrow waxing and I was referred by About Face Salon here.  (According to AZSpaGirls, About Face are the eyebrow experts but they no longer offer the service....)  They were great about squeezing me in the day I called.  Angela was fantastic, she worked very quickly and with a very light hand.  She is so good with the wax that she doesn't need to tweeze at all, which for me is always the worst part.  (Granted I don't have very um, complicated, eyebrows).  She was very sweet and for $15 I will be returning to her.",1
"The sales people here are very knowledgable and helpful. They are also very friendly and great with reccomendations.

I know it is a comic store but I only went there for DnD books/suppliments and ocassional Anime.

I am pretty sure their Anime is bootleged, but due to how cheap it is and the fact that you usually can't find it anywhere else I don't care. They often come in complete sets for like 30 bucks which is great for a whole series. I have had problems watching them on PS2/Xbox sometimes but due to the price I keep coming back. 

Now then if it weren't for this next part they would have a 4 star.

They no longer sell DnD books, or Dice sets which breaks my heart. They always had the best selection when it came to dice and I haven't been able to find another place that carries more than 5-6 at a time.

Out of all the Atomic Comics I have been to I like this one the most, the people there are always fun and inviting I can't stress that enough.",0
"Uhhh...These are supposed to be carne fries? 

ASU boys think that these are the best carne fries. Me thinks not. The carne fries consist of boiled meat AND the order is wrong. It's supposed to have the guacamole on top of the sour cream on top of the melted cheese over the meat, but they just dumped the boiled carne asada on top of the sour cream. I told some ASU boy about this, but he said that I probably had a different person making my carne fries  the wrong way. What a disappointment, but I ate everything anyway because I'm fat like that. hahha",0
"I really like this place. There aren't that many lanes, so if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, call ahead and reserve your lane. 
This place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area. Over where the 10 lanes are, there are about 4 pool tables, another bar, and another table and couches area. The end of the lanes have screens above them to watch sports or music videos. They play good music very loud. I had a really great time. 
My only complaint, we reserved lanes for 4 hours, and when the 4 hours was up, they wanted us out immediately. They started bussing the tables just taking drinks away. I was busy changing my shoes and didn't notice the busboy grabbed my drink. Excuse me, I just purchased that. I let him know that I understood they wanted us gone, but should ask the person sitting there which drink is theirs before throwing it away. As we were leaving, I was at the other table in our area and the busboy asks me if any of the drinks on that table were mine. I reminded him that he threw mine away and he should probably be asking that question to somebody else. It really annoyed me. 
I would definitely recommend it for a Sunday fun day. I didn't feel like we could really relax and have a good time on a Saturday because it was too busy and the staff was looking to make money rather than have their guests entertained.",1
"Well, it's fresh, and it's easy.  Perfect words to describe this cute, clean little store!  This was my fave F&E in Phoenix because it was a mere block and a half from my place.  I STILL miss it, and I moved away from Phx over a year ago!  I popped in here several times a week to pick up staples, (it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down-- they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down).  I appreciated their little bundles of veggies which were sold in just-right amounts (as in, not so much that some of it will end up going bad). This market was also great for soups (their brand was my pick, although they have a selection of major brands as well); it was also my go-to place for prepared healthful lunches perfect for work (like the F&E pre-made burritos and pasta dishes).  

Check out frozen foods too-- there are reasonably priced items like tempura, and special organic seafood dishes I never found anywhere else.  

I also liked the casual setup of the checkout area, with the option for a cashier or self-serve.  

And...wait for it... I just found out they are opening at least two F&Es in Sacramento!!!  (okay, that won't likely cause much of a stir with the Phoenix crowd, but I am so excited they'll be open in my area!)",1
"I have been eating at Wildfish since it opened and after my most recent Saturday evening dining experience, I must say, the quality of both the food and service have gone way downhill. 

I know....a busy Saturday night and so, perhaps I should give both the servers and chef a break? Sorry. The menu has changed and so has the quality of food - and not in a good way. Let me just give you a brief sample of our experience - the Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer has been changed to a lackluster combination of flavors. The idea of tuna with mango seems lovely however there is a total and complete blandness to the way this dish is now served. The former tuna appetizer was far more tempting. Moving onto the Goat Cheese Medallion Arugula salad. My salad was served sans medallion and literally laden with a huge glob of cold goat cheese and some terribly prepared mushrooms. What happened to the warm, crusted goat cheese? Next, we both ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sole. While the sole was prepared well, I do not recall this dish having a cream based sauce in the past. If memory serves me well, the dish should have had a lemon sauce delicately balancing the flavor of the fish. Cream and sole do not make a happy pair!  I am not sure if this was an error or part of the new menu. Okay, and for the piece de resistance we ordered a side of the Sugar Snap Peas which were actually drowning in a bath of some kind of soy and oil sauce. It actually made me ill to eat it - and my companion, as well. 

Our service was slow and unattentive - although I do realize service can be a very personal experience. 

I was sick with food poisoning all day Sunday - as if the poorly prepared food were not enough to bring down my joy. 

So, I caution those of you who may have once enjoyed this restaurant like me - think twice before dropping a pretty penny at Wildfish.",0
This place wasn't that great for the price.  I spent 15 on 2 mini grilled cheese sliders and a tea (basically bar food over priced) Not much to choose from on the menu plus portion size didn't equal out to what I paid for.   The crowd is very Scottsdale and the staff wasn't that friendly.  Definitely wont go back here again.,0
"I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again. 

The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill. 

The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl. 

There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite. 

Free-range and refills on beverages. 

Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections. 

We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead. 

Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend.",0
I really like the facial I had done. I was able to choose what I wanted and I could see the results when I left. Very nice.,1
"Super fast service of OK-tasting subs. I've definitely had better, so the signs hanging all over the place that claim that they're ""gourmet"" is definitely a bit of marketing puffery. Yes, it's gourmet compared to....actually, I think Subway makes a better sub, so I can't really compare it to being more gourmet than anything really. Maybe it's gourmet because they put a ton of sprouts (and lettuce) in the sub? 

I will give the place props for the very speedy service. I ordered my sub and it was handed to me within 1 minute. Another thing I noticed about the place was that it was filled with male patrons. If you're a single lady looking for a manly man, come to Jimmy John's.",0
"OVERPRICED & DECEITFUL & RUDE!

I should have read the reviews before I came here! I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch, not much. I asked her, how much will this cost? She assured me it would not be ""much"". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, can't even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said it's because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I don't know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off!

Previously I've been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. They're also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!",0
"This is a place that you want to go to if you're looking for fresh clean food- not if you want a large meal.  I left satisfied but not full.  The prices are a bit steeper for the amount of food that you get- but you are paying for quality, not quantity.  I opted for a salad which hit the spot- but could have been a tad bigger.... as a result we definitely had room for dessert.  I recommend the apple crisp :)",1
"The pancakes would be a 5, but the breakfast burrio would be a 3 and the breakfast torta a 4 so I averaged it out to a 4 star.  A very cute little place and you have to try the pancakes for breakfast.  You can order just 1 if you want, perfect for those of you with something else in mind but still have to try the 5 star highly recommended pancakes!!!!",1
"This is a great little hidden gem! From the outside, it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice. 

The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level. 

The waitstaff are also very friendly. They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an ""order at the counter"" place.

Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!",1
"I want very badly to love this bar.  I really do.  It has all the promising combinations of qualities I look for in a local locale.  

Great beer.  I have no qualms about ordering the French Canadian Hefeweizen (that I can't even pronounce, spell or at this moment recall) with one glass all to myself and lick my lips at many other brews on the menu.  Add a wine list beyond belief and liquor if its your poison too.

The proximity to my own compound and the blossoming bud that is the central Phoenix renaissance  is always worth a gold star; why commute when staying local is a better option?

The staff and owners of the Sidebar are fantastic.  From my induction many months ago they sling the drinks with pride and the effort in the setup and delivery of the place doesn't go unnoticed. 

The decor is where things start to slide.  Not because the place is hovel, far from it.  Everything is crisp and new.  From the hydraulic bar stools, to the multicolored ambient lighting to the comfy lounge couches, to the super clean bathrooms; this place is a slice of upper crust for those of us who don't normally even thing to nibble from such a decadent pie.  Herein lies the problem or as my former boozing partner visiting from his new digs in Portland put it, ""I'd like to see this place with about 10 years worth of dust on it.""  Not my style, but I dig it and Phoenix sure as hell needs a place like it.

In the end I will go back and don't mind in the slightest having a place like Sidebar to show off to East Valley dwellers and Scottsdale brats, but every time I reach for the front door I pause and am sad.

A mere few feet away lies the corpse of the beloved Emerald Lounge.  A dark, seedy, dirty, smoke filled haven of locals, live music, art and personality that is now nothing but a painted over ghost.  So please, support your local bar, bring your friends and keep the sidebar real.  But remember to pause for a moment of silence and drink one to the ghost below your feet; us locals will thank you.",0
"I enjoy their Rama Chicken. Their peanut sauce is great. However, their service is slow. It is difficult to eat lunch their because it takes so long. If they improved their service my rating  would be 5 stars.",1
"::Sigh::

I love places like this.  It is adorable and unique and intimate and perfect.  The outdoor patio looks like a great hang out spot (but obviously it is too hot for any of that just yet) and the interior is small and intimate.  I was surprised when I walked in as it was much smaller than I thought it would be- but who knows where I got the idea that it would be a gigantic place.  

Our server was hilarious and fun- he happened to be from Ohio and informed me he was a Buckeye (I'm from Michigan, but I'm not a Wolverine so Buckeyes usually don't hate me) and was pretty cool about taking my fun jabs at his home state.  He was super attentive and even was nice enough to give me directions home (horrific sense of direction). I kind of wanted to be best friends with him.  Anyway... 

I had the one organic glass of red wine on the menu (he brought me a sample first) and the Pasena.  Both were great beverage choices.  I also got to nibble on the tomato/mozzarella and flaked tuna bruschetta and was pleased with both.  I'd go with the original.

I dream of the day that I find such a cute little place on the West side (feel free to suggest one if I'm missing it).  The atmosphere rocks, and the unique booze options only add to the charm of this place.",1
"Food was tolerable, and tasteless.  The chips were actually tostadas that were extremely hard (almost stale) when eating. The entrees we ordered were bland.  The rice and beans had no flavor at all.  Maybe that is Baja style of food, but couldn't find the flavor anywhere.
The service was great and the ambiance was wonderful, but I don't think we'll be going to this place again.",0
"Great food, great atmosphere.  Look for the grafetti out back.  Not ""Mexican food,"" but Mexico City cuisine.",1
"Good food, good service!  We go here a lot!",1
"This is a lake.  

It has water in it.  It's not very clean water.  

The lake police will yell at you if you let your dog swim in the water.

That sucks.  

I think it's semi-retarded to review a lake.",0
"I've eaten at this Smashburger a few times and I'm always pleased with my food and the friendliness of the staff.  On my most recent visit, I called ahead to pick up my family's order and we were not disappointed, once again.  We ordered a variety of menu items (and in typical 'When Harry Met Sally...' style) - a grilled chicken spinach and goat cheese sandwich (subbing the goat cheese for American & changing the multigrain bun to egg), a build-your-own burger with an egg bun, spicy chipotle mayo, pickles and onions, an order of Smashfries, an order of french fries and an order of fried pickles.  Everything was made perfectly to order and plenty of extra sauces (ranch, etc;) were provided without having to ask.  
On weekends, this shop is jam packed and it's a wait to get a table, but worth it.  During the week, everything flows very smoothly and the vultures ""circling"" for booths is at a minimum.  
I highly recommend this Smashburger location whether dining in or taking taking your meal on the go.",1
"Staff was very rude, bowling prices weren't displayed to the best of their ability, extreme bowling itself was over priced almost $20 per person. The only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot, temperature wise. they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on. And the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games. It was not a pleasant experience and I don't believe we'll be going to this facility again.",0
"Not impressed. Start with the service. Not professional. It seemed as though the wait staff was clueless as to the table numbers. We were given the wrong table's order twice. 

Second, the food was conceptually a mess. No clear theme or flavor profiles. The food was heavy, greasy and took forever to arrive. None of the dishes were memorable. 

Third, the wine selection seemed to be lacking. And, the sommelier didn't know where the wine was from she was serving. Not impressed.",0
"The Sport Chalet is a little bit of a playground for me because they have an assortment of gear and clothing for many sports and outdoor activities. Among the areas within the store that I've visited in the past are boxing, basketball, hiking, shoes, workout clothing, swimming, & kayaking. They carry high-quality equipment from well-known brands. 

The store associates are helpful too without being too pushy. Specifically, they acknowledge your presense; ask you if they can be of assistance and then move along their way. The Sport Chalet also has a free membership rewards plan as well, which is nice to have, but not necessarily the selling point for shopping here. That is, you'd have to purchase a lot to accumulate a certificate for a few bucks off. Although, I probably receive a $10 off certificate at least twice a year just for being a member. 

Finally, the one aspect about this store and other Sport Chalet locations that sets them apart from other large sports stores such as Sports Authority and Dick's Sporting Goods is the scuba gear and onsite scuba training they offer. You are even offered the opportunity to try it out in their back pool, which I've experienced myself. You just have to fill out a waiver releasing the Sport Chalet from liabilities and acknowledging that you are in good health. Then, you change in your swimming gear and head out to the back to meet the PADI-certified scuba instructor. You don't have to put on much gear. It's just a pair of fins, a buoyancy compensator over your back, oxygen regulator into your mouth, and a mask. You're guided by the instructor as you first swim near the surface and then head deeper into the pool. I did feel really awkward at first, but that's to be expected. As I left the pool and was guided to the front door of the Sport Chalet, the other scuba instructor provided some recommendations on some equipment and indicated they do not receive any commission for the sale of certain products. I totally enjoyed my first scuba experience and recommend at least trying it out at the Sport Chalet. They offer these ""try-outs"" around the spring and summer.",1
"Tasty food, great deals at happy hour..",1
"Good reviews are easy to write. Stop reading this and just go eat there! 

OK, well I have visited this place for years now and don't go anywhere else if I am in this area. 

I like the Chef's, they are friendly and quick. They speak pretty good Spanish to me and but I don't dare try to respond in Japanese, ha ha. 

The value is phenomenal, where can two people get miso soup, salad, beans, tea, ice cream and sushi rolls all for under $20? 

I've tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and can't do it for under $40 or more for two. 

All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical. 

Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner. 

The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant. Some reviews on here complain about them. I don't have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well. 

I will keep coming back.",1
Pretty nice sports bar. A lot of nice tvs. Food is typical sports bar food with a few exceptional choices. Would stop by again if I was in the area.,0
"Highly recommend. This is my second time here and I see #3 on the way.
I've had the (bistec encebollado & arroz imperial with shrimp ""no melted cheese"") I do recommend both plates. Next time I will try (ropa vieja)
Great service! Ask for Kelly.",1
"Absolutely horrendous.  This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly), laugh about it to your face, lie about it, blow it off, make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS.",0
"Great service, and great food.  Passed snacks included an artichoke cake served cold with an olive tapenade.  My favorite was a shaved beef with mascapone dressed in truffle oil.  The main courses included a cesar salad served in individual cups.  Sliders were delicious with my favorite being chicken with roasted pineapple.  They had a wonderful shrimp pasta dish that was gobbled up by people.  Desserts were cupcakes in four different flavors, red velvet with real cream cheese frosting, a chocolate decadent cupcake, luscious lemon and finally a vanilla buttercream.  I will definately recommend them for our next catering event in house.",1
"This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything. The food here is light, simple, and fresh. We started out with the guacamole which was amazing. My sister doesn't even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style. The salsa that came with it was the bomb. One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa. The green one was so good I wanted to drink it. I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans. Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal. We had some kind of carmel, banana, crepe thing. It doesn't look like much but it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Gallo Blanco is my new obsession.",1
"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated.",1
"1 word. PIE!!!!

they have really good pies here, traditional, and some not so traditional...but still really good. 

food is ok. nothing that will blow your socks off. i find it better in my freezer section then in the restaurant. pot pie is pretty good too",1
"Took almost 45 mins for a oil change (they told me 20 mins when I got there) and it cost something like that as well...  Slow and expensive, not 2 things I like associated with my lube jobs.",0
"So your going to Scottsdale via Paradise Valley....or your coming from Scottsdale heading east....your stomach is growling but you don't want the usual...then look no further than Jason's Deli. I was in that situation on Friday night and decided to give this locale a try....and I must say I was not disappointed. I had the Smokey Jack Panini with Smoked turkey breast....guacamole....provolone cheese....lettuce...tomato....bacon on the side which I gave to my wife....LOL...since I don't eat red meat....and Russian dressing. However sandwich was made to order and pressed perfectly on the grill....and the flavor was outstanding. They give you a pickle and homemade potato chips on the side....and I also had some lemonade which comes from a fountain with free refills. 

I almost missed out on the free Ice Cream....but I seen people walking around with cones of Ice Cream and I had my wife ask was it free. Indeed it was and we both enjoyed a nice Ice Cream cone....mine was chocolate vanilla swirl...and you can also get it in a cup as well. The service was great and the whole place had a real nice neighborhood feel to it.....I look forward to returning here very soon. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",1
"Not a bad place.... It is defiantly more tex-mex than authentic... but they have Mexican beer, margaritas and is in a good location.",0
Best gyro in town! We go for the lunch special during the work week quite often. I havent been for dinner but if its half as good as their lunch gyro then you wont be disappointed. Service is great and they always take good care of us.,1
"When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serrano's on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serrano's in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serrano's but it doesn't have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....I'm sorry :)",0
"Wow. Wow Freakin' Wow.

I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER. 

I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.

I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.

When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!

The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.

We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.

But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.

Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.

For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.

Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) 

It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.

Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through. 

The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)

THUMBS WAY UP!!!",1
"I've got two names for you:  TYLER & MARCO - - superstar instructors at the Y!!!

I've been an avid gym member at various gyms for years and I have to say, the YMCA downtown can't be beat for the 8-5 p.m. work schedule person who likes to attend the gym during lunch or right after work.  I'm all about the group exercise classes and this Y offers an array of classes such as spin, kickboxing, Zumba, Yogalates, Boot camp, water aerobics, Hatha Yoga, etc., etc.

Back to my fav instructors:  Tyler and Marco.  Boy, do these boys kick my ass every time I take their classes! Tyler teaches spin and offers not only strong knowledge and great tips on making your spin experience the best that it can be, he has a kick-ass playlist of music to motivate his class.  Marco is a very intense and interactive kickboxing instructor who keeps pushing you with great music mixes to keep his class sweating the weight and stress away.

Thank you Tyler and Marco for making my workouts intense and fun!  After years of going to different aerobic classes, I'm FINALLY seeing the results!!

P.S.  You can't beat the staff that works there.  Erica who manages all the group exercise instructor welcomes any suggestions or comments with a smile.  Freddie at the front desk is also very helpful and sweet.",1
"I am slightly confused as to what this place is.
Is it a coffee shop? yes.
Is it an ice cream parlor? well..yes.
Is it an antechamber for the hair salon upstairs? kinda.
Seemingly the Pink Spot *giggle* is trying to be a few things at once, and vaguely succeeding at those goals.
I like the Pink Spot *giggle* for a number of reasons:
-location
-convenience
-ambience
-selection
In all honestly it isnt the best coffee shop that the area offers, but It's another option- and that my friends, is a corner stone of capitalism: consumer choice.
Now I won't be making the Pink Spot *giggle*, my local haunt, that spot belongs to Lola, and I would never cheat on my beloved tranny. But for those special nights when I get the strange urge for simultaneous brain freeze and a scalded tongue, i'll go down on the Pink Spot...*giggle*",0
"As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it.  Then you see the special board which read ""Good Food Takes Time"" and there is a clock next to that.  Fine that's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our ""good food"" it came out and was awful.  My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store.  $30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away.  The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal.",0
"If you're a local, check out their spa's slow day specials (most often a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday). It's a nice little spa in a great location and the staff was pretty good too!. It doesn't hurt that Trader Vic's is so close by and has tropical happy hour specials for afterwards :)!. Great Staycation location! 
Here's a sample of the newsletter spa specials:

It's my fav starbuck cuz it's across the street form my house. It taunts me daily. Pavlovian response make my mouth water for a white mocha nonfat no whip everytime. The people who work there remember the regulars and offer suggestions and even help you save money by working the angles to get you the combination special price.  Also a good place for people watching or picking up a little something on the way to the light rail or antiquing up 7th Ave.,1
"I searched hi and lo and had only been able to make good on the very lo with regards to good Chinese food in the Valley.  I am VERY picky and I rate most Chinese food places based on the thickness of the membrane of their won-ton soup and the colour of their fried rice.  Having passed my non doughy and not yellow test ( yup people, some places give you frozen dumplings versus fresh and yellow ""Spanish Rice"" in a Chinese restaurant), I was able to look into the quality of their other food items.
When you can deliver Mei Fun Singapore style noodles perfectly seasoned with no greasy residue, I feel you deserve that illusive fifth star.  
Service was pleasant and there was a lot of foot traffic for take away items.  I also note that they offered iced Thai tea with cream.  My buddy got a plate of broccoli, tofu, and a wonderful  Kun Pao sauce.  Sorry, but I think he created it himself and they make everything to order just for food snobs such as we.

Hmmmm.  I am getting hungry. I think  I will go  there now.  Wonder if I should get their pepper steak.",1
"Now THIS is ramen! I even ordered it for take out and could tell with my first slurp that it was everything I'd been looking for. Complex broth, yummy noodles, all the right toppings...the only thing I would have changed is the pork, which was tough and chewy and not melt-in-your mouth delicious. I'd definitely try again while dining in to see if the quality I'd the pork improved. The rest of the ramen was so tasty it didn't matter! 

Also, for take out the service was super quick and friendly. The prices are great, too! I got the ramen lunch special which came with a California roll that was incredibly tasty and fresh, and it came out to under ten bucks for a lot of food!",1
"I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities. This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park. Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store. I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available. Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge.",1
"I LOVE LOVE me some Joe's real bbq!!  They have the best ribs in town and their bake beans are amazing!  There's little pieces of meat mixed in with the beans and it's sooo good.  Their mac and cheese is great as well as their corn.  Pretty much everything is great here.  

The first time I went here was when I first moved out to AZ back in 2006.  My fiance took me here because he knows I'm a bbq fanatic, and I swear I though to myself, ""What is this place?  A cafeteria?"".  I did not expect the food to be any good at all.  Well, was I took quick to judge!  Taught me never to judge a book by it's covers again!  Even though you get in line, pick up a tray and order your food like you would to the lunch lady in HS, the food is the best.  They even have an outdoor seating area with trees and lights.  It makes you feel like you're at a nice park having a nice bbq.

Joe's is hands down my favorite bbq joint in the valley.  Nothing tops this.  Anything you order is amazing.

Oh, and try their chocolate chip cookie.  Soft and melty and so so good!",1
"Two and a half stars, really. 

This place is really quite strange. Video coffee bar? I don't have much to compare it to, I guess.

We'll start with the coffee: traditional espresso macchiato. No microfoam, large bubbles in the milk, too hot to drink right away. The shot was good, but by the time it was cool enough to drink had lost quite a bit of flavor.

Very friendly service, on the other hand. Given that Phoenix-foam tends to be subpar, I tend to think that service and atmosphere are almost more viable measures for successful coffeeshops than coffee. (in Phoenix) 

The actual place was pretty odd. Large paintings of Mexican sugar skulls in the back, nice chairs and tables, an orange faux-finish on the walls... And then the video bar element. Three huge flatscreens on the wall playing pop music videos from the '90s. Very strange, in my opinion. I'm not sure that Cher and Madonna really mesh with coffee shop, but I guess they're trying something new. 

I had a nice time lounging and it was relatively quiet with regularly good lighting.",0
I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix. I was blown away by the services. This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years. I received a room on the 15 floor. Room was what you expect from Sheraton. The view from the room really sucked!! I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers. TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee. Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didn't get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!,1
"Good lord.  I don't ask for much.  I ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee.  They didn't have to bake the quiche, just warm it up.  I waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it.  The server looked confused and the Guy who took my order said he ""got lost.""  I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was ""eh.""  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, I'm nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.  Fortunately, I was on my scooter, so I could squeeze into a non-parking space easily.",0
One of the few legit brewpubs around.,1
"I stopped in here at 6:45am one morning and was told I was a bit early.  I'm used to coffee shops opening earlier I guess, but they were nice about it and invited me in to sit and wait. 

I liked their stacks of Latin American Vogue, and the artwork on the walls was nice.  They also had ice water out for you to serve yourself. 

I ordered my usual americano, and was pleased.  They have raw sugar you can serve yourself by the heaping spoonful out of a pretty candy dish.  That was lovely.

Also, they are now the only place to carry Sweet Peas Bakery items.  My favorite thing to do was walk down to Danielle's shop downtown and pick up some coffee at Royal and some of her Rosemary Shortbread cookies.  It doesn't sound yummy, but believe me they are!  Be sure to ask for some. 

At the time I went, the place was obviously not crowded and I received attentive service...",0
"I'm going to have to work through this review before I decide on 3 or 4 stars. I've been thinking about this since my visit and I cannot seem to come to a conclusion. Another one of those times I wish we had half star options.

The Parlor is definitely The Vig's little baby sister. It Aesthetically looks extremely similar, it has both the same Scottsdale-esque vibe and crowd, both are in weird, out-of-the way locations, and both are really loud. 

Even for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a Saturday night, I thought this place was crowded. There was over a 45-minute wait for two of us, so we ended up grabbing a beer at the bar. I'm glad we did because our bar tender was smokin hot. Nothing better for the self esteem of two broken-hearted girls than a cute, flirty bartender. 

After a while we just decided to eat at the bar and skip the whole table idea. Good choice, even though the bar area was REALLY loud. 

On to the food... we started out with the cheezy cauliflower appetizer. OH MY GOOD LORD. It was amazing. It was topped with bread crumbs and baked... it was just absolutely amazing. It was good later as a midnight snack and good as breakfast the next morning. 

For dinner we shared a Pesto and a Margharita pizza. I loved both of them, but the Margharita had more flavor and I preferred it over the Pesto. Both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty.

I'm pretty stoked that the prices are so reasonable. Two hours, five beers, an appetizer and two pizza's later, we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip. My solo bar tabs are normally higher than that!

My major complaint, though, was the whole entire time I was there I had a stuffed nose. I don't know if it was an allergy to something they were cooking, the wood, flowers, etc but I could barely breathe. The second we stepped outside it was like I had a new nose.

Man.. I still don't know... three ... four... three ... four... okay .. my decision is made: if the 6' tall snobettes coming into the bathroom as we were walking out didn't smash rudely into my dining partner and act like she was Antichrist for trying to inhabit the same place at the same time, I would definitely go with a 4 but it's a 3 for now until things settle down a bit.",0
"Best place around for sweet and sour chicken! The kids meals rock as they come with fried rice, a choice of meat and beef skewers. Did I mention their only 5-6 bucks? Little outdoor seating patio. The only thing we've found on the menu none of my family likes it the egg rolls.  Good prices and food.",1
"$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack.",0
"My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though.",1
I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added. The service is excellent there. You always get treated friendly and with a smile!,1
"I want the Garage to do well. It is still a work in progress, though. Three of us visited two weeks ago. We were sat right next to a group of 40 - 55 year old ladies out for a surprise birthday. What's with that anyways. Do you really need to go to a somewhat small restaurant with your pack of ""girls,"" and occupy a large swath of the dining area? Do you need all the paraphernalia (collages, centerpieces, hats)? I was seriously waiting to see a youngish birthday girl. Nope, she was the oldest. 60, easy. Act your age. While you're at it, you are not a size six anymore. Needless to say, it was loud. At least one of the revelers apologized right when we sat. As if that's any conciliation for the volume 11 cackling. 

First off, the Garage has good brewskis. Not a huge supply, but what they have is quality. We had wings and truffle oil deviled eggs. Both were great. I had Schriner's Sausage Flat bread, and it was great. Wife had something, I forget, and said it was good. Friend had some large salad and said it was good, too. Overall, food was better than most. 

So, why the three stars you ask? Service. Why do some cool places slip up on this? Is it because they hire ""cool people"" or friends that don't really want to work? First off, a server (we were seated at the entrance/ exit to the kitchen) dropped a glass bottle of ketchup five feet from my foot. My wife and I had splatter on our jeans and glass near our sandal clad feet. Hardly a response. We were handed a rag. Our server not so sympathetically wondered, ""Oh, they almost dropped a bottle of ketchup on you."" The rest of the night just seemed a little disorganized and not relaxing? Every server seemed in the weeds or confused. Empty beer and water glasses. Entrees arrived and empty app plates sat there. 

$60 for three for apps, dinner and beers.",0
"Midday parking at this place is seriously a joke, but such is the case with a lot of swank midtown lunch spots. 

Pizza was great, my East Coast hailing girlfriend gave it a thumbs up, which for an AZ pizza place is a huge kudos. We came to check out both this and the adjoining Pink Spot Coffee and Ice cream. We ate on the ice cream side, so I can't comment much on the decor of the Z Pizza side. 

Good ingredients, not the usual suspects, so that is a change. I will pay for good quality pizza, so the price was in line for the quality of the food.

It did a ton of lunch business but was efficient and the staff was smiling and not hating their life, which is always pleasant .",1
"I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I definitely won't eat here.",0
"Alright, well seeing as I work right next door, my mouth has been watering over this place ever since I laid eyes upon the menu. And tonight, we finally had some yummy Rumbi take-out.

First things first: they're a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamie's parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce.

The shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut ""Rumbi rice"".

We also ordered some of their Bahama Mama's Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something.

For dessert, we had some of Rumbi's Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling.

All in all? Great place with reasonable prices, given their generous portions. They have a TON of salad options, as well, each more inventive than the last, and I'll be returning to try and test each one :)",1
"This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant, rivals anything I've sampled in Washington DC or Seattle.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a Top-5 restaurant for me (along with Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles - yum!).

Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu.  Many of the entrees are offered as small portions ($4.50-$6.00 each).  They suggest each diner order 2-3 of these to make a meal. Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants, you can order combo plates (meat combo, veggie combo, house combo plate etc.).  This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated, but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes.

Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs (the spicy version with Awaze spice paste).  Lamb was soooo tender, and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes.  Good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites!!  We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best I've ever had.  Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.  Lalibela's was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils.

Staff was great - attentive, helpful service.  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesn't compromise on quality or authenticity.  One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - it's a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I don't think it's fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.  I'm used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibela's injera doesn't compete with the flavor of the entrees as much.

All in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to, and I have been to many in the States.  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!  Highly, highly recommended.",1
"My nephew just moved to Scottsdale recently so me and a bunch of friends brought him here to show him a local bar that he and the girlfriend could come shoot pool, watch football, play volleyball etc...well....we weren't there 5minutes and 2 kids were running around the pool tables, messing up our games and screaming. I couldn't believe the staff was allowing this to happen. They were hitting the pool sticks on everything and crying when their mom attempted (in vain) to quiet them. You'd think the mom would leave at this point with her  kids....um...no....the staff did seem annoyed as well but said nothing. Then....it happened...she said "" you guys better behave or mommy will be fired""!! Holy shit....she works there!! Even worse! Shame on that owner for allowing this to happen. And that employee needs to recognize this...YOU WORK AT A BAR.....not a daycare....A BAR!!!",0
"I should have done this so long ago, but we forget our Doctor's need reviews too! I've sent my boyfriend, my family and my friend's to her. You should know about her too! I've been going to Dr. Bradley for 10 years! She is my all time favorite doctor because she is always bright, smiling, genuine and just overall warm! You want to thank her and hug her at the same time. Her staff is professional and friendly. Mandy at the front desk is wonderful at her job. I've followed Dr. Bradley to 2 locations and would never think of going anywhere else. She's helped me with everything from migraines to pnuemonia to well woman check ups to getting my gall bladder removed! What a versatile and knowledgeable woman she is! I take my son to her now and he isn't afraid to go in. Peace of mind knowing we will be treated well, and taken care of is all I could really ask for in a general doctor!",1
"Nicely edited selection of mid to high end electronics.    Knowledgeable and professional staff.  These guys (and gals) know what they are talking about and will go the extra mile in terms of customer service.  



Thinking about splurging on a home theater?  Ask for Scott.  He will listen to you and help you build your dream system within your budget.  He will even respond to your hi-fi emergencies (eg. the guests are arriving for your Super Bowl party and you don't remember how to work the mission control style remote).",1
"We arrived at 7:00, had a party of six, and were able to be seated within 15 minutes. Fabulous, considering the number of hungry people coming into the restaurant that evening, but we have always had good luck getting right into Grimaldi's, regardless of the location.

The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it, but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza. One of the reasons my partner and I keep going back to the Old Town location is for the consistently tasty crust: crisp and thin, yet chewy and moist as well. Our pizza last night had a thicker crust and too well done, by comparison. Maybe the QC will improve as time goes on--I'm sure we'll be back to see.",0
"Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment.

The dolma's were the best I've had, their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lamb-based dishes.

The entertainment was great. Live music, belly dancing, greek-style fun, broken plates, and dancing.

Since I had the sampler plate I can tell you that if you're vegan, vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that, you might not enjoy the food here (Greek Lasagna?....really?) Also, the chicken was no good but I don't really like chicken anyway.",1
"I love this place. What can I say? 

Richard Cho not only has some of the best customer service skills I have ever seen (that guy has an amazing memory for names) but some of the most creative approaches to making Sushi in the valley. I love coming to Sushi Eye, I have never had a bad experience in all the years I have been going to the 2x New times Best of Phoenix award winner.

The use of Macadamia nuts is brilliant and an amazing addition to many of the creative rolls that are available. The Spicy scallop roll is a go to for sure. They have (and I know this sounds stupid) the BEST California rolls in Arizona. As pedestrian as that roll is, The California roll is transformed in to a very dessert style treat when ordered at Sushi Eye. Seriously, do it.

Go check it out, introduce yourself to Richard and be amazed when he remembers your name. You will be amazed by the food as well.",1
"I stumbled in here craving breakfast because it was very close to the airport and very close to the Aloft hotel I was staying at.  Yes, I am a tourist and yes, I am from a part of the US where cowboys are not common, so walking into a place full of country western paraphanalia made me smile.  The service was good, the food was delicious, and I walked out with a few good photos.  The coffee was a tad bit weak, but I'm a starbucks bold drinker, so I don't hold it against them.",1
"This place is a dream.  Designer blouses for $17.00.  Seven jeans and Hudson jeans for $20.  Steve Madden shoes for $25.  I could go on... the store is beautiful, well-organized and full of things that are in perfect or near-perfect condition.  Some items are still quite pricey, but most of the store is extremely reasonably priced.  

If you need something new very quickly for a date or an interview or a special occasion, you will probably find it here.  The employees are nice, friendly, helpful and the dressing rooms are good as well.  Love it!",1
"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!


They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it. 


So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on. 


I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool). 


Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time.

That's about as much my tummy let me eat for today. I'm sure the rest will be just as good and I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies.",1
"I love guerrero's!  I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time. I'm a huera, but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic.  It's a husband and wife team that runs it.  The best thing are the beans - incidentally, that's how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated).  Thinner, lighter colored, and delicious compared to any I've EVER had this side of the border.  I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think I'm gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa! Yum!",1
"great place to go with out of towners after a downtown game!

the drinks here are better than the bar food!",1
"Pleasant and beautiful. Feed the koi fish cheerios. Bathrooms are out of a catalog...I want that! Walk at a snail's pace, because it's not terribly large. When you're done, walk down to Pita Jungle or Lola Coffee!",0
"I love this place the more I go to it! The service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called, Mexican Gumbo. Holy schneikies it's good!!! Can't beat the prices either! If I had a choice of this place over Chipotle, I would choose Qdoba ANY day!!!",1
"You may think this is a cop out... writing a review of Starbucks. It's like writing a review of water. (""It's wet, delicious and necessary to my survival!"") 

My aim is simple here though. This particular Starbucks location is an excellent place for people watching. Try hanging out there between the hours of 11am and 1pm on a Friday afternoon and tell me you aren't entertained by some of the patrons who go in and out of the doors. While attending school, I was taking a screenwriting class and given the arduous task of writing descriptions of about 35 random people. Where did I go to write every single one of them? Park Central Starbucks. 

The crew here is also super friendly every time I come in and they do their best to remember my name. It doesn't help that I tell them a different name every time. OK that's not true, but what a fun social experiment that would make.

The coffee... been there, done that and there's not much else I can say about it, but for the sport of people-watching, this a great place to hang out in the corner and just take it all in.",1
A few co-workers and I were in town for a conference and decided to check out this place on a Tuesday for lunch.  Service was fast and the sandwiches were good.  The bread was fresh...I would suggest splitting because a whole sandwich is just too much for a regular appetite.,1
"Dropped by for a manicure, and as soon as I sat down, my manicurist started talking in rapid Vietnamese. I couldn't see her headset so I thought she was speaking to me, but obviously she wasn't. In fact, she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure, except in confusion when I said I didn't want her to cut my cuticles -- just push them back. She really didn't understand that, and asked me in broken English why I was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut. She didn't have an attitude about it, but was just really confused. I think after that exchange, she told whoever was on her phone about it.

I also thought it was strange that she asked me to wash my hands after giving me a lotioned hand massage -- sort of defeats the purpose of applying lotion to my hands in the first place? 

The whole experience was perfunctory, but didn't leave me wanting to return for a manicure. Not asking for a great nail technician, but it would have been nice if she acknowledged my existence other than doing my nails, and most importantly if she asked whether I wanted them cut round or square because I wanted them round!  I would have interrupted her phone conversation to let her know my preference, but she was so fast to dunk my hands back into the soaking dish that I didn't see what they looked like!",0
"Beer...or Yoga?

Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.

Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.

Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  

That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.

As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). 

So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.

I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. 

Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending: 

NAMASTE!",1
"My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry.  Even with that, the food was super yummy.  I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving.  the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too, so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce.  The decoration in the store is quite unique: church pews and wall and table deocrations.  It's a must go if you are around the area.",1
"came out last night with a few friends. The bar was cool, but I'm really not a fan of the crowd in Old Town. The drink prices were not bad, but it was a blast dancing outside. Overall a pretty cool spot.",0
"Just because this place is called ""Maria Maria"" doesn't mean they sell Mexican food. Their menu actually says ""Mexican inspired cuisine"" which should have been my clue to leave. The food is border line Nasty!  

The restaurant is cute and sort of romantic but it's so loud in there that it ruins the ""romantic"" mood. I was excited to see they had live music until they started playing some weird pop music. Why would they do that in a ""Mexican"" restaurant?  I wanted to leave but our waitress was no where to be found 20minutes after we finished our meal.

I don't recommend this place for any meal!  

I have only been living in Scottsdale for two months but it seem that Arizona is ""Cougar"" town. The bar was full of them. I'm beyond annoyed with all this ladies acting like they are 21 wherever I go. I'm embarrassed for them. They dress and act young but with that face and hands who are they kidding besides themselves? gee.",0

"Brand spankin' new...customer service with a smile.

Good selection, good prices, friendly customer service. Bought some stuff to make the house better - garage door opener, some hooks to finally hang that darn 65 x 78 painting up...

Nothing at all like Home Depot, either. I found the fixtures for kitchen improvements here to be of higher quality as well.

Thumbs up from me...plus, it's so close to the house - not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. Time will tell.",1
"BACON, people!  Spicy Italian sausages, brats, even heirloom veggies by the pound?  Locally raised hogs and none of the extra chemicals the corporations and grocery stores use?  I have found my personal piggy promised land and it is The Meat Shop.  

I headed over here with some buddies after hearing that some local restaurants and patrons have been taking notice of the flavor and quality they offer.  We were quite pleased.  The staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the meats, cuts, and preparation.  We grilled up everything that night - the sausages, the brats, the veggies... even the bacon... because, why not?  I think we spent a grand total of $20 and we still had enough leftovers to throw in with some sunny side up eggs and toast the next morning for breakfast.  This place is fantastic and surprisingly the same cost as most of the stuff you'll find in the grocery store.  I can't wait to head back over for round 2!",1

"I just moved to the area so use Yelp but was very sad that the experience here was not worth making a return visit.  The only reason I am posting is because it has not been reviewed in so long.  

I did not like how the spa pedicure was one price and then things you would expect in a spa pedicure was ""upgrades"".  I want to ask for a pedicure and then lay back enjoy the chair and some reading.  

After the pedicure, the woman left me in the chair for my nails to dry and think she completely forgot about me!  I would have left if she had put my flip flops on before painting my nails. 

Their child was cute, but I do not go to get a pedicure to play games with other peoples children.  

Then to top it off, when I paid she asked for my pin as she was walking away (again)....no pin, it was a credit card....usually this would not bother me but I was already frustrated at this point.",0
"I used to go here about once a week when I still lived and worked in Arizona. My office at the time was within walking distance.

This is a very good Hooters location...located smack dab in the middle of Mill Avenue right next to ASU. Plenty of stores all around. 

I used to go mainly for lunches during the week with co-workers. It usually was quieter than evenings or weekends. The serving staff were great and many of the ladies would stand and chat for quite a while...as it was pretty slow.",1
"I don't think there is anything else to be said about Delux, it's been around and they offer nothing but great food; the Classic Burger and the Delux burger are both very delicious.

Great setting to enjoy good food!,1
Horrible service. Barely acknowledged when you first walked in. Slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself. Will not come again.,0
"Yes, it's on the Northwest side and its tucked into a non-descript strip mall better known for being the home of Padre Murphy's Sports Bar, but don't let appearances fool you, this is a great gym. The gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, and group exercise classes. It also has a pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam room. But will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility. It has video games, pop-a-shot, and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much, they are begging to go to the gym... and it's a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going!

Definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the Northwest side.",1

Sit at the bar and watch the grill cook (who also is the server, bartender, and cashier)  grab a nice fat ball of ground and pound it out on the grill to make your one of a kind patty.  NEXT comes the wine onto the grill and the patty... which gives the place it's name.  Finish it off with a fat layers of veggis.

Pair this with some jalapeno bottle caps and a pint of draft, and your in BUSINESS!!!

Don't mind the dingy early 70s decor....it is character.

The only negative...you will be jogging for weeks to drop those calories...a very guilty pleasure.",1
"This is my go to place when I want a cheap quick meal without having to get fast food. They have healthy options and use fresh flavorful ingredients. Their portion sizes are generous and the staff is always nice and friendly. My favorite is the greek salad w/gryo meat, the dressing is awesome! I'm also a fan of the platters and spanakopita.",1
"holy crap.  try the side order of garlic mushrooms.  they are little pieces of heaven that are such a delight to pop in your mouth.

also, on the special menu right now there's a salad called the mediteranian chicken salad, which really truly may be the most incredible salad i've ever eaten in my life.  i wish i could drink the dressing that topped the impressive mix of greens, corn, roasted red peppers, cilantro, raisins, pine nuts, red onions, parsley, well-seasoned chicken, and i can't remember the rest.  omg.  beautiful.

service was fine, not exceptional, but the staff was friendly enough.
i'm so HAPPY i found this place.  go there.",1
"This place is the perfect example of a tourist trap.  Nice location not far of the main drag of Old Scottsdale, beautiful building and layout.  The margaritas are good, but probably $2-$3 more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles.  I thought paying $5 for chips and salsa was a rip-off, but then when the chips tasted stale, I was even less happy.  C'mon, if you have tortilla and factory in your name, you ought to have fresh chips.  I thought the tortillas themselves were okay, not great, but okay.  The carne fuego, or whatever I had the waitress recommended, was not good.  Small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweet/hot sauce. The veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potato-stuffed chile was weird.  It could've been great, but it was nowhere near good.  Unless your Aunt Hattie who has never had Mexican food is in town from Ohio, i'd skip this place altogether.",0
"To sum it up, this place was just not the place for me. Maybe I am just a fuddy duddy, but it seems that the clientele are cougar-like women, aged 30-50, with bleached hair and sequin tops. I expected a quiet wine bar, but instead it is more like a loud night club.

The hubby and I visited The Living Room on a Saturday night, so maybe the whole ""we-wish-we-were-a-club"" thing was just a once a week occurrence, and maybe, just maybe, I am totally un-cool, but we don't plan to return.

Food: Wine specials were fairly decent and priced well. Food was average (3 stars). We had a variety of bruschetta, a tuna salad and a strawberry salad - way too much dressing on both salads. 

Service: It took a long time to get a table (~30 mins), but it was Saturday night and crowded, so expected. Once seated, our waitress seemed more concerned with anything other than serving us. She was not very attentive at all. She asked for my order and walked away. My husband was like ""uh, I kind of want to order too""

Atmosphere: The overall look and feel of the place is pretty neat. It is a smaller restaurant with lots of patio/outdoor seating. Decor is large heavy curtains and many couches, thus the name The Living Room. However, as I mentioned earlier, the music was ridiculously loud. They had a DJ playing music so loud, having a conversation was impossible (and we ended up sitting pretty far from the speakers!). We left a soon as we finished our dinners (didn't stay for more wine or dessert) because the music was just too annoying.",0
Great to see a Total Wine closer to where I live.  Large selection and decent prices. Used the $10 off coupon from the newspaper to buy a nice Napa Cab this afternoon.,0
"Loved the room and its functionality but this same room made me want to punch myself in the face.  I'm a young professional in his mid 30's who likes to party and understands what the W brand provides (especially on the weekends during moneymaker time) but when their DJ on Saturday night sounds like he's spinning from your bathroom, it makes for a tough stay.  Got home at 12:30 a little buzzed and had a rave in my head until 2am.  Finally got to sleep and loved the room and hotel otherwise, but this will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Maybe it's just a few rooms but 205 is a bad number here.",0
"I went to this place the night before my birthday, after making 3 u-turns and k-turn...after reading all the good reviews about this place, i expected to see a lighted up sign at the least to make the average driver realize where to turn...other than that it was great food, looks can be deceiving, looks like a run-down cafeteria but the food was amazing, the bbq beef brisket were tender and melt in your mouth, the pork ribs was delicious, the family size cole slaw was ridiculously small, i thought i was in france ordering es cargo.. but overall good food",1
"I don't drink a lot of coffee, but I'm a fan of tea. Especially strange tea that I probably can't pronounce right. Oh, and I like it when it smells like scotch. Yep, I'm a fan of Lapsang Souchong.

But I'm not a fan of ""foofy"". And that's one thing that Tea infusion is not. It's not foofy. It's funky. It's fun. And everyone who works there is really friendly.

Beyond the teas, the food is good, too. I don't know that I'd eat there every night, but it's a wider variety than I'd expect at a tea place.

This is a regular stop of mine. Makes Tempe Markeplace worth it!",1
"This is a really good Starbucks location. Unlike a lot of the newer locations that have retro plastic chairs that look much more stylish than functional, it has lots of comfy upholstered chairs, plenty of plugs for web surfers, and a decently-sized outdoor seating area. The staff is really friendly and efficient as well. There is also a drive-through.",1
"I needed an oil change reeeeaaaally badly (i know, but i have a honda and those things can run on gas fumes for 30 miles and oil resin for months) and had had an OK experience at the danny's family on HIghland (free wash with a oil change, who doesn't love that?)

But. I checked the Danny's site and saw no promotion of the wash and didn't want to drive out of my way for nothing. i checked yelp and this Jiffy Lube had the best rating i could expect for an oil change place and was up the road from work. Downloaded the coupon (thanks for the tip, Kym) and was on my way.

Pull in and i tell the guy i want the ""Signature"" change which includes window wash and floor vacuum, mentioning my $5 off coupon. He said that they were already running a special that was $13 off the $35 price so i said a-ok, cowboy. 

i wait for about 8-10 minutes in the small waiting room (bonus for having a Phoenix Magazine in the stack of Muscle Car Monthly, Oil Today and Antennas Weekly - look, just because i'm getting routine maintenance on my car does not mean i'm INTO cars).

I get pulled into the garage area for the ""spiel"" everybody dreads but it was surprisingly short and non-pushy. (i'm glad they don't drag you over to your engine anymore, that's totally lame). i do have to note that he tried to tell me my right front blinker, my left back blinker and my license plate lights were out. i had JUST gone to Checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd. i kept saying as much, and he kept insisting and i was about to ask to see for myself when he calls out to another worker ""Hey, was that the honda with the lights or the jeep?"" the other guy says ""the jeep."" however, there was no other car in the place. hmmmmmmmm.

OK, so i pay up ($24 altogether with a tax or fee or something added in) and go back into the waiting area while they finish up. I decide to use the bathroom -- and this is where the they lost two stars (this was, up until then, quite possibly a four-star experience - wait, two stars for a bathroom, you ask? oh, you just wait...)

the bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life, and i've been to some raunch truck stop pee holes. literally, piss, in the bowl... i get in closer and i shit you not (pun intended) four shit smears in the bowl as well (yeah, i counted). two rolls of TP hanging out on top of the dispenser, each with one square left on them. realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess, i discover no soap or paper towels (not very surprising). as well, hair clippings all over the sink, like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break. un-freaking-believable. i am still haunted by this bathroom experience.

but car's running great!",0
"Tott's is this amazing little neighborhood Asian restaurant that has quickly become a favorite of mine!
The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere!
This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. 
1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork.
I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry ""panang"" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees' faces.
I must also confess my longing for PF Chang's or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Tott's.
Tott's even has excellent Won Ton soup. Now if they could only get a beer and wine license.",1
A great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain.  We have been going to Tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love.  There are plenty of TV's for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts.,1
"I am so sorry I didn't come here sooner! This is a great sports bar not far from our house. The service was very friendly, and the killer wings (they also have honey BBQ) were awesome. They had tons of meat on them, which isn't always the case with wings, as I am sure most of you can attest.

We also had the margherita pizza, which was pretty tasty. There were numerous TVs scattered throughout the restaurant, and they had $1 beers (yes $1) when we were there - fantastic deal!

This place is definitely more chill than Fox Sports Grill (not quite as fancy or upscale), but it's a perfect sports watching or beer drinking venue nonetheless. 

Oh, and they deliver!!!!!! Good choice if you live in North Scottsdale.",1
"Had an opportunity to take our Canadian guests to Aiello's for supper on the weekend.  It was a a moderate drive but we were not disappointed.  We were rewarded with pleasant surroundings, attentive service and good food.  The complementary hot pepper starter was unusual and tasty when coupled with the fresh bread.  The Mushroom Ravioli Special was especially enjoyed by my spouse and the other entrees brought favorable reviews from our guests.  All in all an enjoyable dining experience.",1
"Water park is OK.  However, the parking lot has ZERO security.  No security patrols, no cameras.  My catalytic converters were stolen off my truck in the parking lot at Big Surf Tempe today.  Sawed right off in broad daylight.  According to the cops, car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here.  BEWARE!  The water park management doesn't give a shit.  Even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing:  ""Our camera is broken but it's getting fixed next week"".  What a joke.  If you go, have someone drop you off.  You've been warned!",0
"always consistent quality and value. we have been regulars of pappadeaux in our previous  home of TX, and we still are big fans!",1
"First, and most importantly, every person I've met at QC Vet Clinic has been super!  They are caring and wonderful with my dogs.  They are never too busy to smile and give great service when I come through the door.  They have even taken time to share stories and pictures of their own pets.

Second, they understand that some people must take a fiscally conservative approach with the care of their pets.  They discussed all options thoroughly with me and I performed the care that was needed a little at a time -- as it was needed.  This was important to me since many vets that we've visited in the past have handed us an estimate for hundreds or thousands of dollars and wouldn't budge -- insisting that we HAD to do ALL the work listed.  At QC Vet Clinic, I didn't feel like I was judged for that decision.

Unfortunately, we had a small mistake that I discussed with the vet.  She listened and gave appropriate feedback to my concerns.  This is really the only thing that is preventing a 5 star rating.  Overall they are still the best vet I've visited and I will continue to put my pets lives in their very capable hands.

BTW, we had to have a pet put down because he was ill. The team at QC Vet Clinic was absolutely the best!  They were so empathetic and even sent us a sympathy card with a little surprise inside... I won't give it away, but it was so very special to my family.  It's the little things in life that fill our hearts...thanks QC Vet Clinic!",1
"I have to admit the quality of food here is better than your average berto's restaurant, However the girl who works the drive-through during the late shift makes some of the strangest mistakes with the food. Warning if your ordering 2 items don't be surprised to find them in one box combined into some strange hybrid. I honestly don't think she understands the word ""And"". This has happened to me several times int the last month. Always make sure to check your order here.",0
"Even though there are only two things on the menu that I can eat, they're damned tasty and the service is incredibly fast.  I am a bit surprised by all the five stars though, you people do realize that this is just a chain sandwich joint, right?",1
"4.5 Stars
The seafood tower was amazing and my ribeye was very good.  Very expensive.  Much better experience than the ocean club in Newport Beach.",1
"Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service",0
Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia,1
"Yay! I got to try the happy hour finally! They even had a sweet band playing in the dinning room, great ambiance. 

On 4th of July weekend the girls and I got a room at the Valley Ho and ventured over to Vic's for some much need food around happy hour time. The fun drinks were totally wroth it! I got the burger on the HH menu, it was sooo yummy, huge and came with a bunch of fries and was only $3. Crazy right?! We were pretty tired so we couldn't stay long, but next time I want to try the calamari, hummus and other fun drinks.",1
"In the interest of full disclosure the only thing I every really go here for is the lunch buffet but wow, what a great buffet! I believe the buffet itself is about $10 and for that you get a wide range of vegetarian items and as with other items on the buffet most of those get changed out over time so you get a rotation of various dishes as you come back. They also have hummus and baba ghanoush (like hummus but made with eggplant instead of chickpeas). There is generally at least one dish with red meat (today it was a tomato based stew with eggplant and either beef or lamb) and usually two dishes with chicken.

I generally get iced tea to go with the meal and one thing to note, they do not serve alcohol so if you want to go someplace where you can also have a drink or two, this would not be a good place to go but if you just want a place with really good Middle Eastern food (the owners told me it is really Lebanese cooking but I'm going to just generalize and say for most of us, when you try it, you will think Middle Eastern). Of course, you can walk a block or two to 4 peaks brewery, in the same area, and have a drink or two before or after you your meal. 

One really nice thing about this place it is right off the Apache stop on the light rail and right across the road (same side of the street) is Pita Jungle so a wide range of good food options right off that light rail stop.

Bottom line, I've never had anyone I've taken here NOT like it and everyone who has gone has wanted to go back again. I like it for lunch during the workday because it is quick and you have a wide variety of regularly changed out tasty food options, so I recommend you give it a try if you have the time. :-)",1
"I really love this place. I'm not sure why there are so many mixed reviews... maybe what they ordered? I always get the regular size custom burger... blue cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato (and sometimes bacon). Simple and delicious. The rosemary fries with Smash sauce are also amazing. The only thing I didn't care for were the fried pickles... a bit too salty.",1
"Agree with the previous review. Something nice about this super target.  Leaving a review to back up the other!!

My only gripe is I spend to much at Targer. Or my wife does anyway!!!",1
"I VERY much enjoy this place.  The Duck sandwich has changed my life.  The brick oven gives the pizza a natural, full flavor, homemade style taste that makes you slow down and enjoy every bite!  The atmosphere, the set up, and the bar is all very welcoming and very clean.  Hard to spot when you are driving down the road.  i have been there about 10 times and i still pass it up sometimes.  Parking is not the best, and valet is not really needed, but they very much have top shelf alcohol and delicious food to boot.  Not extremely expensive either, but pricey enough to make you count your bills before you enter just so you will have enough.  Great place!",1
"i love this place and eat there every time I'm in the area.  Pizza, pasta, appetizers all fantastic.  Plan to spend some time waiting for a table.  We always have fun just eating at the bar.  Yumm",1
"A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the ""main"" menu. Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.

$7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.

Beers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.

Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!",1
"Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.

This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the ""Grand Opening"" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!

It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!

As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.",1
"Yeah, its BBB....what else to say?",1
"This place is the white-trash Chipotle. The food is mediocre at best. I mean seriously, how can you just up and steal Chipotle's idea! There's no creativity there. The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all. Seriously? I asked for HOT, not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!  At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food. Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is. Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up. 
The chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken. The Fajita veggie were the same. The product looked of very low quality. Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce. The meat looked unappetizing as well. Just not at the level of Chipotle. Although I have been here twice, this is the last time for me. I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better. So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good. I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe! Employees were dumber than a bag of Frijoles!
This place has the worst ""Mexican"" Food I have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 7-11 or a burrito from Taco Bell. Just disgusting food.",0
Jimmy Johns is cheaper and better ... The Capriotti food is heavy ... and it doesn't taste as good as you think it should taste,0
"Heed the negative reviews.

This restaurant can be summed up in two words: mediocre & overpriced. I wish I had gone with my instinct and given more weight to the negative reviews. The positive reviews of the spring rolls lured me in, however, much to my disappointment. One spring roll is $4.50, although we fortunately went for the happy hour and only paid $3.50, which was still too much, in my opinion. They were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor., and we tried 3 different kinds. The peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls.

I had the Lemon Grass Chicken for dinner. The chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet. I couldn't detect even a hint of the lemon grass. The presentation was unappetizing, with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles.

I'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didn't want to be negative, but neither of them made any positive comments about their food. 

As I said, pay attention to the negative reviews. If you like bland, overpriced food, you may like this place, but otherwise I can't see anyone going back for more.",0
"ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS RESTAURANT!!!! Amazing location and such a great food !!! Been going there for a long, long time! I have yet be even slightly annoyed. BLISS! They wait on you hand and foot, food presentation and TASTE is Fantastic...Always make you feel very special.. the hostesses are not rude nor snooty and are always smiling- GREAT Managers! LOVE them all around! ( and I AM SUPER PICKY ( and Proud of it!) DO IT!!! GO THERE!!!!! #1 rest. per me in AZ for beautiful location and food!",1
"Culver's is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out. I believe they have several stores now here in the valley. The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers, Cheese curds, Frys, Frozen custurd....lol ...the list goes on... I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy.",1
"This place could be great, and I've always wanted to like it more than I actually do.  Occasionally, I have stopped into Mill's End for breakfast, specifically because they have crepes on their menu; in fact, their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe.  For reasons explained below, lately I've found myself just walking past Mill's End, no longer considering giving it my business.  The general issues that I have with this place involve just a couple of basic things; if the owners made the effort to correct these, I believe Mill's End could be a great cafe.

I have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors.  It is with all three of these that Mill's End falls short: 

1)Ambience.  This means that the environment must be suitable both for studying/reading, as well as relaxation.  So, the music playing needs to be something that is non-intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore; sometimes Mill's End has this covered, but other times not at all.  Onto the seating.  It seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995, in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the TV show ""Friends;"" unfortunately, they didn't come close, but there is usually plenty of seating open.  By the way, what is up with pseudo-sexual ice photography on the walls?

2)Price.  This is actually my number one problem with Mill's End.  The coffee is reasonably priced, but the food is too expensive.  Anytime I tell someone that I ate there, it's always the same response, ""yeah, their food is good, but it's really pricey.""  Considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop, I imagine that their business has gone up, but those prices sure haven't dropped.

3.Customer service.  The staff has always been just lukewarm.  Look, I don't expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time, I only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality; this has just always been kind of lacking at Mill's End.

Honestly, I think this place has a lot of potential, but it seems to be awash in complacency.",0
"This place needs to close their doors, get their act together, and then reopen. The atmosphere is boring and it is obvious that they did the bare minimum coverup from the last restaurant. The food is horribly boring and has no flavor. I ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing! We also got the nachos (which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef). In addition, the server didn't put in my order for my pizza, hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating. One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone else's special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well. The only thing I liked was the beer, and that too took forever and I had to remind my server several times to get me a refill. Way to much effort to get food and drink that is sub par at best.",0
"Took my daughter to Mendy's Place 4 times. Treatments, doctors, nurses and other staff were great.

My complaint is that the ER physicians are not in-network (participating) with most insurance companies. Even though the hospital is participating, the physicians are not , thus resulting in larger physician bills.

Us consumers pay dearly for our health insurance. I don't like being overcharged by greedy physicians.",0
"Been there, done that.  Fair sandwiches (better than Safeway, anyway).  Only 2 stars since I didn't know about the free soft serve, so didn't get to try that.

There's gotta be a good New York-style deli west of the 17 and north of Thunderbird.  Isn't there?  Doesn't have to be great.  Good would be wonderful.",0
"We went to Central Grille on Thanksgiving for their buffet.  Good food, excellent service and very nice ambiance.  We asked to sit outside and the weather was great for it.  Great place to sit back, relax and enjoy some food.  While I didn't drink they had a pretty good wine and beer list.  I will go back, enjoyed the experience.",1
"I LOVE Chic Nails!

I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were ""too busy"" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since. 

The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!

P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)",1
"Do not bother going anywhere else. This is the place to go for laser. No contracts, easy to get appointments, very reasonable. The staff is fantastic, every one of them. I usually go to Kristen, but all others are as equally friendly and competent. Location is very convenient also. I have looked, and I have received many groupon and living social offers from other places, but I never bothered. This is the one.",1
"Ive been here twice and my favorite item has been their version of tiramisu. It's not soaked in espresso or whatever the local italian eateries are using these days..it's made with champagne! It's light and fluffy..it's like eating a cloud from heaven. Very much a date place.. It has a ""romantic"" atmosphere so don't go there if you're not trying to give off that vibe. Otherwise great for a group setting..... Oh and for any potential cougars the waitstaff is delicious eye candy. ;)",1
"Ate here twice while staying at the Biltmore.  Ordered the breakfast buffet and Bloody Mary the first day, which would warrant 3 stars.  Basic buffet with sausages, bacon, eggs, potatoes, french toast, omelet station, and desserts.  Omelet station was one of the better ones I've had, but everything else was average.  Bloody Mary had cheese, shrimp, and some other things on it and was quite tasty.

On the second visit, we had the lunch special which was chicken salad served in a tomato bowl and a pizza.  The chicken salad sounds very simple, but was extremely delicious.  The pizza was one of the best I've had in a LONG time.  I'd definitely order the pizza again.",1
"I used to frequent this restaurant years and years ago. I was a student at the Deer Valley airport, and eventually a flight instructor as well. It was a great location with awesome views. The food was always descent the the service was great. 

Nothing too exciting, but a great place.",0
"Open late, that is a huge plus!  Been here for lunch and for dinner, also in different times of the year.  Service is always stellar.  Food is always good.  Sometimes there is something weird with the check such as charging for things that were supposed to be included or full price for happy hour items or something like that.  Not sure why that keeps happening, there seems to be some pressure on the staff.  
Otherwise, the place is trendy and seems small and loud in the busy times, spacious and accommodating when just the right amount of people.  
Best time is dinner, in a booth, not on a weekend and when you are really hungry as the food portions are generous.",1
"Huge store, friendly staff",1
"I really want to rate the place higher. I like what it's all about. Instead of pulling the building down and rebuilding something in that space, it has been converted to a community space. 
  I went to see one of their cult classics, and the staff was ok. It was completely amateur hour - I guess that's ok for the type of movie, etc. The problem was this was a sold out movie, and the staff brought in folding chairs to sit on to watch - that would have been ok before the movie started, but ithey did it one at a time making noise for the first 30 minutes of the movie - clanging, whispering, etc. Then they kept getting up and down.
  They seating was pretty bad. Low seats that reclined - normally that's ok, but there's usually some spring to it. These had no support at all. Halfway through my back was hurting and would have to readjust - but there was no comfortable way to sit in the chairs.",0
"Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly, I can't call it a ""hot dog"" because that just conjures up images of, well... a hot dog. And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than ""a hot dog"" the way most people know hot dogs. Know what I mean? No? Well, go have a Short Leash Dog. 

Really unique combinations, various dog options (all local meats and produce) - bratwurst, beer hot, veggie... 

My friend and I shared an Aiko (we chose the brat as our dog), with mango chutney, red onions, cilantro, mayo and jalapeño on a naan (you might have read that in other reviews, no traditional buns here!). 

You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings, and if you follow them on Twitter (@shortleashdogs) you can find out when/where else they make regular stops... scottsdale, central phoenix... Track 'em down and eat their food. And talk to them - Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service! What's not to love?",1
"This is the BEST hit or miss bargain spot for everything. I frequently find great deals on quality body care products (be sure you know how to read the labels, there's a lot of low quality products in the mix), designer sun glasses, shoes, clothing, housewares, baby shower gifts, pet gifts, and guy gifts. It seems I go at peak hours, where lines are incredibly long. I see it as a small price for Macy's quality at a Walmart price.",1
"The Beer is good, most of the food is ok, but I have a big issue with BJ's.  They advertise their pizza as Chicago style deep dish.  When you order one, you'll know right away why there isn't a single location of this chain in Illinois.  The Pizza is more like something I'd expect to have ordered at Pizza Hut than anything I've had growing up in Chicago.

Have a beer here before seeing a movie next door.  Other than that, there's way better places to eat in and around Chandler Fashion Center Mall.",0
"Bit over priced, but they're tea is to die for!",0
"Nestled between the bright lights of the once famous Graham Central Station and a no-name BBQ place is a lovely gem I like to refer to as ""Skips"".

The bar side of this place is nothing too special. Don't get me wrong, its BIG for a bar, but the ambiance and furniture are pretty dated. So, unless you enjoy playing pool, I don't know why you would want to come here.

That being said, the pool here is great!  They just got around 15 brand new Diamond 7' tables which play AWESOME.  Their 9' tables also play well, but they have some PRETTY unforgiving pockets.  So if you are a beginner, I wouldn't play on the big tables unless you like to be frustrated.

They have no house cues on the floor.  you have to rent them up at the bar for $1.00.  This is great because they can maintain a better quality cue for you (if you use house cues).

Their food is actually REALLY good! I've had their Turkey Burger which was moist and delicious.  It comes with a nicely sized basket of fries.  Also, their Nachos are ridiculous good (That's saying a lot coming from me)! The only bad thing about their nachos is that they use that liquid fake cheese... I prefer shredded blends on my nachos.

The waitresses there are uber friendly. Yes, UBER! They always make a point to remember your name and they are always SOOO busy! Make sure to tip them well. They will remember you!

Wednesday night is league night there, so unless you want to watch, avoid Wednesday from 7-10pm. Oh, and HH is from 2-7 and lots of the food (including the nachos and Turkey Burger) are priced to sell!

Go shoot some pool!",1
"This place had amazing food for reasonable prices. They have tiny card games at the tables which was pretty neat too, it keeps you busy while you wait for your food. The bar was neat, and the atmosphere was ok. I did not enjoy the music, and it was too loud to ignore. The service was pretty good, but the waitress made my friends and I uncomfortable, like we shouldn't have been there. It might have just been that one particular girl, and I would still go back. Don't dress too casual...",1
"This wendy's is terrible. I grew up going to Wendy's but recently the whole chain has become disgusting. This one is just a slow, disgusting chain. Blah, rather eat pretty much any where else.",0
"Mid size American airport with very good organization, very straight forward, no hassle. 

Security is a little slow and priority lane isn't really priority, it's more of ""let's make fun of first class flyers getting pissed"" lane, so let's welcome first class flyers with big giggle!! 

Many stores and food quality is okay. Seating areas are limited, at least for the Terminal 3 before security, so be aware. 

Lots of volunteers working here to guide you to the right place, there may be more volunteers than passengers. Haha.",1
"This review is based on delivery, service and food quality as delivered.

Second and last time I will be ordering from this place. The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time. 

Tonight I Ordered at 11:03 PM, estimated delivery at 11:50 updated to 11:54 PM (from a whopping 1.5 miles away to add). 11:54 comes and goes. Call them, at 12:07 AM now, I am told they are on their way (1.5 miles away keep in mind). Call back at 12:40 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 1:00 AM. They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 12:44 AM. My ""hot sub"" is ice cold, there's nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 1:00 AM on a Monday (now Tuesday) night...if you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this, at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to be....never again silver mine...never again.

This place probably has a ""good taste potential"". Unfortunately, like most ""hot food"" the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits...in a fridge, alley, or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours. If you feel the need to get food from here..for the love of sub kings please just DON'T GET DELIVERY!",0
My wife and I ate here when we were in town for the B&J auto auction.  The food was good and affordable.  We liked the fact that they had a full bar and we were able to have a couple of tasty Margaritas.  Staff was friendly overall we had a good dining experience.,1
"The coffee at this location is awful- please go get lessons from the lady at the Thunderbird and 40th street location.

However, the primary morning guy, Shawn, is awesome. He is friendly and chipper, but not so much so that he's annoying as your first human contact of the day. He is generous with the toppings and speedy.",0
This was my first time here. It was a nice experience.. And I found that I really like Indian food ! Good stuff !,1
"My house has never been this clean EVER!!! I am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism expressed by the women who cleaned my house today! I bought a Living Social coupon, and I am so glad I found this company. 5 women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 45 minutes. The women were friendly to me and especially my dog, which is the sign of a wonderful company, if you ask me. I am hoping I am able to use this service on a monthly basis. Angela scheduled my appointment immediately when I let her know I had company coming in town, and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time. I am thrilled with the results!",1
"I made it to China King at 2:40 pm on a Sunday and I called ahead expressing a desire to have a late Dim Sum lunch. However, once we arrived they only had a five items to try. I was bummed, but I will make sure I go early next time so I can here what everyone raves about. My average Singapore vermicelli was a poor substitute, but I will arrive earlier next week so I don't interrupt staff meal. That seemed to be the focus when we there, as service was neglectful and quite indifferent.

Also, I found a hair in my food, but why complain when they really don't care if you're there or not.",0
"Fantastic experience from valet to dessert!! Boyfriend and I were both very impressed. We were graciously greeted the moment we walked in by a man in a suit who walked us to the restaurant. Our server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and suggested some things to try when we were waffling between a few different choices. Cheese trio platter was sooooo good. I'll be getting that every time we come here and it was the perfect size for the two of us to share. I had the beet salad which was very good. Love the candied walnuts in it. Boyfriend had the lamb which he said was perfect: Tender, juicy and delicious!  The breads that came at the beginning of the meal were obviously homemade and fresh. Even the coffee was good. It's very rare for us to find a place that does it right so completely but I think we've found it.  Service was fantastic! Our glasses were never empty and we were well attended without being pestered. Could it be possible I can't find anything to criticize?! I can't. Love this place.",1
"What else can I say that hasn't been said already?  

I'm weirdly glad that they're not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because I'll be there every day = gaining tons of weight!

My baby loved the mango lassi flavor! So much he did the sign for ""more "" for the first time at the store:)

I do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order",1
"I really don't consider myself a Neiman's type of girl...
As a matter of fact, I don't really feel comfortable in Neiman's - it's extremely 'fancy' and high end for me.  But, I've gone in a handful of times and even bought a dress or two on sale at Neiman's in the past.  I admit, the quality associated with the designer labels at this store is pretty amazing.

Anyways, I felt some major pressure to register at Neiman's from my mom, so I met my mother-in-law-to-be at this Neiman's location on Sunday.  The housewares / registry department is extremely small... and although the woman working was sweet, she botched the spelling of Jared's name in the process.  Needless to say, i was not so impressed.

Fancy sums this department store up in my eyes - I'm much more of a Nordstrom's or Macy's or Bloomingdales type of girl!",1
Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyone's really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.,1
I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years.  I will never go anywhere else.  My hair always looks amazing when I leave.  The color and cut are always perfect!  I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave.  First class salon!  Beautiful surroundings!  Always great service!  They aim to please!  Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time!  Thanks everyone!,1

It was a good ride Jimmy Johns, but you have no locations close to my newly purchased home.  Its not you, its me.  I promise.

This place is my new go to sub shack.",1
"I honestly feel a bit bad giving Wildflower a three star rating, but I'm honestly waiting for the time when I feel impressed with their food. 

I've been to Wildflower quite a few times, ordering something different each time. First time was the sweet potato and fig sandwich. Disaster. Next time with the BLT plus. Ick. Next time was Potato Soup. Eh. I don't know what my problem is, everyone raves about this place as being awesome. 

The nice thing about this location is that I can meet friends here for a mediocre lunch and walk to the movie theatre or Target afterwords.",0
"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. The owner was snoring when I walked in, so that was odd and kind of a turn off. Their regular manicures are cheap- $10, but the experience overall was so-so. It got busier as my manicure was going on, so it got a little better. Parking is pretty bad..they have approx. 3 spaces. Manicure was fine..have a range of OPI but all their polishes were jumbled together which I hate. Overall, for a few dollars more there are better places, even down the street.",0
"Gymboree, many years ago I brought my first son to Gymboree quite often and really enjoyed.  Never thought I would be back, but now we have another gymboree tike and he loves it.  

I am very happy to have been reintroduced to Gymboree and have already made plans to go again with my son next week.  The instructor made it look easy and really communicated very well with both parents and children. 

Thinking about Gymboree now, my only regret is that I know someday my boy is going to outgrow it, and I want these times to last forever.",1
"This place is pretty good for a chain, and it's very easy to find something for everyone here. The staff has always been friendly, and the menu is huge! The food is just okay though. Would return with friends or for convenience, but we would not go on our own.",0
"Place is OK, I'm just not a big fan of what they have to offer! It's funny reading some of the complaints! People get a grip! Food is good, place is a cafe style, so your service is really up to you! Cookies are really good, my wife enjoys their sandwiches.",0
"My guy and i decided to try this new salon that just opened a couple months ago. The man and woman working there are so friendly! We were chatting the whole time. As soon as we sat down they offered l us water. The chairs are great and the water color changes as you sit there, kinda cool. The pedicure includes a hot lotion and rock message that is awesome! 
Great place, we will be back!",1
"This is a great Thai food restaurant. My husband and I have been here a few times and have been very pleased with the food, as well as the service. We usually order a few curries and of course the pad Thai. The food is always consistently good. Good Thai food is sometimes hard to find, you definitely won't be disappointed here.",1
"Brought my car in to get the electric stuff checked. $25 to do an electronic systems check, then determined it was a bad alternator. I brought my car in at the end of the day, about 5pm or so, and they had it ready by 11am the next day. 

The owner/manager, Terry, seemed like a straight up guy. Pricing is fair, as far as I could tell. 

They seem to stay pretty busy with normal cars as well as business fleet vehicles. I've seen school buses there, Topkick-sized trucks, and as well as your standard fare trucks with lawnmowers on the back.",1
"Excellent atmosphere, eclectic menu, and reasonable prices. Welcome to The Parlor! Pizza seems to be their specialty but the menu offers so much more. Friends swear by the duck club sandwich, and my wife loves the sausage pizza. If you visit during peak times expect a wait, but head to the bar for a drink until your table is ready. Staff is super friendly- our server forgot to deliver apps we ordered and made it right by providing free apps (equal value) for our next visit. He was apologetic and owned up to the mistake (he simply forgot to add to computer) - it happens but he handled it well. I'll be back!",1
"Really pulled a douche bag move by coming here at 9:45pm when they close at 10:00, but everything was closed except for fast food places, in which we didn't feel in the mood for. The hostess didn't give us any attitude and sat us...It was super dark, but had comfy booths. 

Andy was our waiter and he had such a great attitude, we apologized for coming in so late, but he assured us that we were fine. The salad was good, but kind of small, the buttery croissant that accompanied it, however is tasty. Hubs got porkchops and I got the chicken soup. Not bad, we ended up talking and laughing with Andy about the restaurant industry...too bad the bar was closed, I wanted to see if he wanted to drink with us.",1
"Way old school. I did the lunch buffet, $6 and change including drink.  It was actually pretty good.  Yes there were a few times I asked myself ""exactly what part of a chicken is this from?"" but the flavors were good. I'm guessing about 15 different items on the buffet.

I'm guessing this place has been here for 10+ years, maybe double that.  Red cheesy Asian interior as you would expect in a place like this.

I like this place, so what are you going to do about it?",1
"3.5 stars

Fast friendly service and the food was good. 

I ordered Hung Pao rice bowl, while it was not huge and loaded with things it was plenty for a lunch size. The food tasted good. 

We ordered it Sunday evening for dinner. Orange chicken, General Tso chicken and chicken fried rice. ALL with white meat. While I really like the fact you can get all white meat, it was a little dry. Perhaps the way it was sliced and not in small cubes? All the food was good but not the best I have had. 

I would order again.",1
"I always have fun here.

I went here on new years this year and had a good time.

I did see the most pathetic lesbian here. She wore her make up and dressed just ike the Shane Character in the LWord.

Al I could think was, WOW what a loser.
and I wish I was that skinny

Do you have no personality that you wear a costume everyday.!!

So I was with my girlfriend in line and we were holding each other. She walked away for five seconds and asked my girlfriend for her number.
My girlfriend totally dissed her.
I walked up and you could see the fear in her eye. She just kept saying  Sorry, Sorry, Sorry.

Well anyway aside from that I like this place.

But dont go in the bathroom unless you have to. There are always tranny's doing coke or k in the womens bathroom.

Make sure and use a tissue to lock and unlock the stall",1
"I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it. I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun, friendly, professional and very informative. This place is top notch. Won't go to another place for my piercings again! No way! It is very clean, and these guys know their stuff! Really impressed...I could go on and on! I won't get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they don't have something you want they order it, easy peasy. Love it!",1
"The Good: 
Really good burger.
Good fries.
The Bad:
Terrible paint and lighting. Can't even hang out for long. (Maybe that is the idea.) Don't like high booth stalls much.
JMHO of course.
Also a note to the sewage smell that others noted. That little area on that side of the mall has smelled like hell for years for some odd reason. It sucks for the businesses, but I assure you it has nothing to do with Smashburger alone nor should it cause any health concerns. Just luck of the draw on a bad sewer vent problem.

Update: 4/18/10
Went again. Really very good. Decor is still not my fav but the food is solid. Like I said, it is the juiciest burger I have had in a while. Shoestring fries are kill. Upped from 3 stars to four.",1
"I went to NOCA about a month after is opened and was wowed. I told all my fellow foodies about my wonderful experience, the innovative menu and all the little extras that made the meal a really special dining experience in Phoenix. 
I went back with friends twice after in the coming months and was pleased each time. 
I just went back this past Saturday though, and would have to say I would no longer suggest it for a special night out. It was as if the magic was gone and that the place was showing its age and loosing its ""specialness"". It was really just ok. The chef's talent shows, but too many other let downs. 
When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation the place was crowded. The host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was. We sat down at our table and that's when things started turning out not as well as expected. Seated in a back corner--which I did not mind---I noticed the walls were filthy---scratched and beat up and dirty. That was my view, so of course its all I could focus on. The waiter did not show up for 5 min. to take our drink order, and when he did it took 20 min. to get them to us. He apologized, but at 8:45 on a Saturday night that waiting for a first drink is not fun. 
When then settled down with our menus and picked our choices. It was then we were told that they were out of the veal --which of course 2 of us had chosen by then, and that there was only one Skate dish--which of course the other 2 of us had decided on. They were also out of 3 other items. I felt I was back in the old Eleve (located in this same spot)--the food was great there as well---when they did not run out of many items on the menu. They may be ok when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment. 
Gone were the pop rocks that I thought was so fun as an intermezzo, instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us. A simple salad--good--was $15---and most starters are at least that much. Good, but not worth the price. Otherwise, entrees were good--not special, but tasty and served with good presentation. The cotton candy is still there--and still an attention getter. And I still love the desert selections---especially the malt that I had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces. 
I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new, beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall. And they usually still have most menu selections on a Saturday night.",0
This place is your standard hole in the wall pho. They've got good tasting pho and spring rolls for cheap. :D The cleanliness is definitely lacking but more flavor fo' yo' noodlee!,0
"I actually yelped this restaurant from my brunch table and my blackberry wouldn't post the review.  So, will try to capture the original intensity of the yelp.  I still love my blackberry and maintain it is better than iPhone, by the way!

Anyway, anyone who knows me well appreciates the importance of toast in my life.  When I moved to Phoenix to work for a catholic hospital, my best friend bought me a ""Jesus toast"" stamp which puts an imprint of the Mary which appears better when the bread is toasted.  I guess she wanted me to fit in.

So when I told my waiter I was having a ""bad toast experience"" and he blew me off, you can imagine the impact.  I ordered the oatmeal as well as the basket of toasted willow breads served with a variety of jellies, Nutella, honey etc.  My oatmeal came out with over-buttered, grilled bruschetta-style toast; that's it--a plate with a bowl of oatmeal and 3 pieces of bread.  I asked for flatware, then brown sugar and milk, then inquired about my basket of willow bread.  The waiter said, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal.  I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam.  I decided to stop complaining (cus I had been making ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils).  I put jam on the ""toast"" and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease.  Meanwhile the table next to us (the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful Sunday) was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread, perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments.  I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork (still a veggie after 25 years) and he said again, ""this is the toast that comes with your meal"".  My friend was getting embarrassed, so I gave it up and left.  How hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread?

Ok, now all the anger is stirred up... I must say that My florist is one of my fav weeknight spots and their pianist is first rate-amazing.  She truly plays from her soul and her personality shines through in her interpretations of classic songs.  I have been there since the ""toast experience"", but make my friend arrive first to look for the waiter with the ponytail!",0
"I had lunch here the other day.  It was a bit before the noon lunch rush so it wasn't too crowded.  You could tell they were gearing up for it so I can tell they get pretty busy.  So come early to avoid waiting with throngs of school kids that undoubtedly come from the high school next door.  

I like that their menu isn't huge with zillions of burger combos and other options.  It was pretty straight forward.  I had the standard burger, fries and a drink.  Everything looks like it is pretty much cooked to order so it took a few minutes to get my food which was ok.  The cashier guy who looked suspiciously like Ray Liotta was very friendly and working like crazy so I'm pretty sure he was the manager if not the owner.

The burger was thick, juicy and cooked perfectly.  It was a tad bit greasy but that made it that much more delicious.  The fries were also pretty good.  They are crinkle cut with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside.  I wasn't exactly sure what to do with the little cup of sauce they give you so I used it for my fries and my burger.  I think it was some chipotle mayo stuff.  It was pretty good but an odd thing to put on burgers and/or fries.

This place isn't exactly cheap but it is worth it.  I can't think of a better fast food burger/fries in the area.  I would return to get the burger but I really want to try their Italian beef as well.",1
"Since I was in AZ area for the weekend with my gf for pleasure we decided to visit one of my friends in the area. She picked this place and we decided to get seafood instead of steak or a meat house. 

First of all, I'd suggest making reservations otherwise DO NOT COME HERE. We showed up at 7pm but weren't seated until 845. Good thing we ate a really good lunch otherwise I'd be starving and complaining like a baby. At least this gave us time to have a few drinks before dinner in the LARGE outdoor waiting patio area. I think it was so crowded because it was the weekend before Fat Tuesday. This place kinda reminds me of Bubba Gump or something similar. It seems fun and they do have a large bar and waiting area. 

We ordered alligator and frog legs as an appetizer. LOVED IT!!! We wanted the fried alligator and frog legs but the waiter absolutely loved that he worked here and HIGHLY recommended that we order it grilled instead. Since he worked here, we figured why not? I was thinking to myself that the cooks were a bit lazy and maybe they didn't want to prepare it. Lol. To my surprise, it was good as he mentioned. I have had both before but not for a few years so I was pleased. My gf ordered the crab stuffed shrimp which was really good. I ordered a  combination seafood plate which was good but not great. 

There are way too many things to order on the menu. A lot of fried food so if you are trying to watch your diet/weight then don't come here. 

I would definitely come here again but I wouldn't be in any rush. Great for a lot of people and groups, but PLEASE make RESERVATIONS.",1
"This place isn't bad. The place is pretty big in size and I love that they have a drive-thru. I like coming here on the weekends, especially when I need to study, particularly in the vault. Some times they have live music, which can be good or bad, depending on if you're there to study or hang out. They have decent coffee, not the best, but not awful. And I'd prefer to go here over Starbucks any day.",0
"So I have been to the location in Tucson and now experienced this one and I have to say that I did not have a WOW or YUMMM drooling moment at either. Don't get me wrong it's not horrible it just has no wow factor at all to me and I will pass next time.

There is just better Mexican cuisine out there,,,


Service was promt though!",0
"This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was! Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart), bargain hunting (TJ Maxx), fast food or dining in (tons of places!), catching a movie (Harkins), stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo), new panties (Vicky's Secret) and a zillion other things. I love that this is close to my house! The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sam's Club.",1
"Delicious. With me, i'm all about frosting.  And Sprinkles delivers! Big, thick layer of frosting on every cupcake. I recently had the Mocha, dark choc cupcake with mocha frosting. Wow... It was so rich i had to take a break of about 5 min before i could finish it. I'm a big fan of the vanilla and banana. You just can't go wrong with cream cheese frosting, right?  OH!  And the best thing of all... You can get a ""shot"" of frosting!  Yep... A 1oz dixie cup piled high with a flavor of your choice for 75cents.  I usually eat my frosting shot in the store while waiting for my cupcake order.   ;-)  It's pricey, but its not an everyday thing... Its a treat and a good one!",1
"Wow. 
The food and atmosphere here are great. 
The music was a little too loud, but, for a weekend away, this place hit the spot perfectly. 
The wait was rather lengthy, so we stalked the bar until some folks left, then had our dinner there. 
I had the largest shrimp cocktail of my life, some really good wine, and grilled asparagus. 
There are so many delicious options in Scottsdale, but, this is pretty specific in vibe. Check it out.",1
"I go to Pro's Ranch Market often for lunch- sometimes several times a week. I've had the street tacos, chile relleno, burritos, and some other tasty treats. I'm a huge fan of the agua fresca stand- my favorites are the strawberry, pineapple, and horchata. And the bakery... oh, the bakery. They have everything sweet you could want including individual servings of flan and tres leches cake. 

The store itself has the cheapest produce in town, a giant meat counter, and a great assortment of cheeses. Ranch Market also has super delicious tortilla chips and salsas. This is one of my favorite places to go if I'm on my way to a BBQ or party- there are so many options!",1
"We made a last minute decision to go out on New Year's Eve.  The restaurant was very busy but after just a few minutes a couple of seats opened at the bar ( our favorite place to sit) and the bar tenders, Blake, Kennan and Clair were ON IT!  They were very busy, but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill.  The food was excellent. My husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and I had Prime Rib  with lobster tail and twice baked potato. Everything was cooked to perfection. Oh yes! Start with the garlic cheese bread as it is yummy!",1
Friendly staff and great Americanos!,1
"A small bite goes a long way. I first was introduced to these brownies in '09 when I received a variety box with 12 sprites and a can of cocoa for Christmas. I love the packaging - the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper. After devouring my first brownie, I was an instant fan. The card in the box said you can freeze the brownies for up to a month but it was gone within the week. The can of cocoa lasted for a good 3 months. I used it for baking - cookies, breads, cakes, etc. 

My faves: Cream Cheese, Espresso Nib, Toffee Crunch, and Caramel. 
The sprites are just the perfect size because it's just enough to get your chocolate fix but not overwhelming. I just throw one in my purse before I leave the house and I can have it with my coffee in the afternoon. 

I'm a subscriber of their email so I've been receiving emails with discount codes and free shipping. It's so hard to resist. Lucky me, I stumbled on a Groupon several months ago and I got a box of 24 Sprite for almost half the price plus shipping.",1
"My first box of NGD arrived a few weeks and tears nearly came to my eyes as I removed the produce from the box.  I haven't seen such beautiful, fresh, well packaged produce since I was a kid (and I'm no spring chicken).  The carrots tasted like the sweet carrots I remember and the lettuce (with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves) so full of flavor.  The amazing thing is that I had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with NGD.

The medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four.  It is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2am.  The unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call Phoenix.  Furthermore, I live way out in Carefree/Cave Creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery.  Not with NGD.  It appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas. 

Finally, there is a gentleman named Ben that works for NGD.  He has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly.

We think NGD is a great value for organic produce delivered to your door and HIGHLY recommend NGD!",1
"My boyfriend and I were searching for a dive near our house in Old Town for when we just aren't feeling the typical Scottsdale vibe.  I gotta tell you, I think we found it.  

We walked in around 7 on a Thursday night, just looking to have a few drinks and some time to talk.  I immediately realized this was not an Old Town bar.  I think I might have been the youngest person there and no one was pretentious at all.  They have a dart board and pool table, and seating with walled mirrors all around.  The patio was extremely well-misted, which was great since it was the day before 4th of July and everyone was pretty much sweltering.  Drinks were stiff and not too expensive and the crowd grew younger as the night went on.  I didn't meet tons of people, but the ones iI did either seemed drunk, super nice or both - not a bad combination.  

I would go back again, just not every night (what do you think I am, an alcoholic?)

Also - for those of you with bladders of steel and small wallets, I saw a sign that says they do bladder buster deals on Tuesday night.  Small cover and incredibly cheap drinks until someone ""breaks the seal"".  I would suck at this, but I'm sure many a person has taken advantage of this interesting drink special.",0
"This is a nothing but pies place...so I was expecting a little bit more oomph...

Dispointing small selection of pie by the slices...also you gotta put in special order ahead of time for the more interesting stuff like Italian Ricotta.  

I was going to order something with berries, but the stuff I saw in the case was just runny and wet looking...so I ended up with a black-bottom pie...I really liked the flaky crust and the filling wasn't bad except for the fact that it did taste a bit over refrigerated.  

A minor gripe is the airpot coffee...not freshly brewed...despite the espresso machine clearly visibile behind the counter.

The pies are just over $4 per slice and ~$20 per pie.",0
"Good choice of ingredients, a bit out of a student budget, but it was WORTHY all the way. I was drooling with the flavors! Good environment and good service and good music (bistro style). I'm not much of a pizza eater, but this has a good place in my list! Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzas...this is a real one!",1
"Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5

I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too.",1
"i love the army, but they make me wake up wicked early.  then i work, work, work and when lunch rolls around, me want tasty goodness FAST.  mamma mia's is the solution.

i got their 2 slice deal, mushrooms.  this cost me $4...that alone makes it rockstar, but you have to ask yourself...does it get any better?!  oh yes, it does!!!  the crust was crunchy, the cheese ooey-gooey and the mushrooms PLENTIFUL, which made me disgustingly happy.  i think pizza places never put enuf mushrooms...today, i met my match.

the joint is hoppin, but they still manage to get you out in about 10 minutes.  plus, you get to stare at frank sinatra while you wait (young, cute blue eyes, not the older, less attractive version) and listen to the tv blaring.  and if you are me, the QUEEN of movie trivia, you enjoy your wait as a time to school co-workers in ""the Game"" while you wait for your AWESOME slices.

moral of the story, go, young ones and enjoy.  the food is plentiful and cheap, atmosphere friendly but small.  its easy to miss...KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED!!!",1
"I went here for a business conference.  Granted, I just came back from a REALLY nice place in NYC, but I still expected something amazing since it was called the GRAND RESORT.  I must agree with fellow yelpers that it seemed a bit outdated.  I did not like the rooms.  There was a baby sink and mirror area.  A bazaar bar in the living room that just didn't seem to fit.  The beds were mediocre.  I did enjoy the kid free pool!  I found it very hard to find my way around this damn place!  I got lost several times :)  I did appreciate their concierge service - very helpful.  I needed a sewing kit to fix a button that came off - $7 later, I had one small thing of thread, baby scissors and a needle.  Drinks and food were sky high.  We ended up walking down to a little mexican food restaurant nearby.  I don't think I would go back...",0
"Okay, I admit it - we are waaaaay late to this party. We tried once before but the hour-plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day. This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible. We arrived around 7:15 (it WAS the weekend after all) and only waited about 20min for a table for two. 

I had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - YUM! The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked. My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that.

Great value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn). If you haven't been, get up early, bring a newspaper and rest assured Matt's Big is well worth the wait.",1
"I'm very excited about their authentic and inexpensive menu. We just had appetizers today, but can't wait to come back for dinner. The mofongo and alcapurrias were beautiful.",1
"This Place just opened up next to the salon I work in. AMAZING! They hit the ground running, 

It's a deli style, where you order at the counter and they bring you the food. I had the Grayhawk Turkey Club and the turkey was great! No packaged crap here. It was thick sliced and probably rotisserie. For the side I had sweet potato tater tots. DELISH! The have regular fries, sweet fries, tater tots, onion rings, etc. 

Great looking salads, Chicago-style dogs, gourmet burgers and yummy sounding mac and cheese. 

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price. It's great for dinner, but a little steep for a work day lunch.",1
"All I needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good Cuban cigar and some brandy!

We had the Papa Rellena for an appetizer... very very good. Its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce.

For entrees my wife and I shared two dishes... the Ropa Viejas (shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce) and the Gallina Frita (crispy fried shredded chicken, onions, in a mojo garlic lime sauce....amazing!

Both dishes were large...with tons of meat.

Great service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the Havana Cafe.

For dessert we indulged on the ""Best Of Phoenix"" (Phoenix New Times) Caramel Flan.... OMG!!!! And the coffee was yummy too! 

We also found a 15% coupon in DineInAz.com.... saved us almost $7!

As the sign over the door says... ""Cha Cha Cha!""",1
"This was the first place my husband to me out to eat out when we started dating, OMG I loved it. The staff is always extremely nice prompt at this location, we enjoy their food and I epically am in love with the 99 cent margaritas they are the best. We always have a wonderful time here new and old memories.",1
"The Flower Studio far exceeded my expectations at my wedding! Christine is an amazing artist, businesswoman and person. She made time to meet with me outside her regular hours and really understood my vision for my wedding. Her arrangements for my wedding were absolutely stunning and really took the event to the next level. I am more than thrilled with this company and would recommend them to anyone. Thank you Flower Studio for making my wedding so beautiful.",1
"The food is good, but I think the prices are too high for what you get.  Considering there are plenty of other places to go for good subs, salads and fruit platters that would be much cheaper, it's hard to choose Duck and Decanter over them.

However, I will go here when I don't have to pay.  Why not, right?",0
"I like the Thai Hut because it is safe Thai eating. They have some of the more adventurous authentic Thai, and then they have what I ALWAYS get - The Garden Delight with beef. Just basically vegetables and beef cooked in a marinade. They always have plenty of servers on hand and I've never been disappointed. There's just some little sparkle that it seems to be missing.

I struggled between giving it a 3 or a 4, but I settled on a 3 because they could definitely improve the atmosphere a little bit and parking sucks. They are really close to the light rail now though, just get off at McDowell/Central and walk one block east on McDowell.",0
"Not that you can compare Firebird to anywhere else in Az but I have been to Joliet Raceway in Chicago (and even though that's newer) I like the arrangement of Firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on.

First off...  NHRA... come on... hands down one of THE coolest events in Az ever, next to NASCAR and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year.  The pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars, beer and food are expensive but what else is new.

They also have drag racing events, any type of racing event, drift, road, moto races, dirt bikes, monster trucks, top fuel drag boats on the lake... I'm sure I'm missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az.

Parking is always good to go... driving out of there just takes a while as you've got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the I-10 but not much they can do about that.

Great place... keep bringing in the NHRA and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and I'll be happy.",1
"It isn't often enough that I get to dine at Carlsbad, but last night I decided to have dinner there. I'll be completely honest, service is always a mixed bag. But then you figure when they're crammed to the gills (which is generally how it goes), you can't always expect Speedy freaking Gonzales to be your server. However, last night I don't think I could have sneezed between the time I ordered my food and when it arrived to my table. Excellent.. is all I can say about this joint.

If you're looking for some tasty New Mexican fare, get over there!! And if it's packed, let the valet park your car(CUZ ITS FREE)! Start off with a Dos Equis Amber, get some nachos(this vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz it's just that tasty) and kick back. Preferably on the patio...because there's a waterfall!!! 

And if Jacob's working the bar.. expect nothing but the best in cocktails... seriously.",1
"Truly a neighborhood bar. Didn't know anyone here, and didn't leave without catching  everyone's name. Maybe not as wide of a beverage selection as the pizzeria-turned-bar in the same lot, but definitely lots more fun. Will return.",0
"This is now Amore Sports Grill. Try the sausage & peppers, they are to die for.",1
"This is my kind of place. Had i not known of the Lost Leaf I would have never found it. Its a house in the historic district. 

 after hesitantly walking in, I find it to be a cozy dimly lit 'house' it reminded me of hanging out at a friends place in college (well replace the blacklight posters with art work). 

The beer selection is top notch as well as the music. i dont go out to bars much, seeing as I am on a drinking hiatus, but this is a place I would go to... just for the atmosphere, music and folks.",1
"I will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30+ mins every time i go. that can only mean it's good right? Well, it's that friendly AND that good that i dont mind waiting. i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable. 

best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it. i'm not fond of their potato has thingys... but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty. my favorite item - turkey sausage eggs benedict... DD style (trade sausage gravy for hollandaise) - very filling as you can imagine. 

breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch, this is my spot.",1
Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.  Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.,0
"I'm pretty much in agreement with the previous five reviews.  A great way to spend the day when it's hitting over a hundred degrees!  It's about a forty-five minute drive from Phoenix.

I went on a Saturday afternoon, around three or so.  So, I missed the huge crowds and rowdy bunch, along with the sun at it's hottest point!  It's about a two to three hour ride from the shuttle drop off point two to the pick up point four.

Rentals are $14/pp, which includes your tube rental and shuttle service.  This is the all day rate, so if you get there in the morning, you can go back again and again.  It's $10/pp without the tube rental.  You can also rent a tube for your ice chest (styrofoam coolers are not recommended as they float away), which is a must as you need to load up on TONS of water and your beverage of choice.

Bring along tons of sunblock and reapply often.  Bring a hat though because you'll be glad you did when you see all the sunburn faces around you.  A few old bedsheets will feel like a godsend on your hot tube, so think about bringing those along too!  And bring along a pair of cheap water shoes or old sneakers because it's definitely rocky and you will need to climb out of the river at the end.  Flip flops or loose sandals are not recommended as you see them floating on by in the fast current.  (Don't be foolish and bring your new expensive sunglasses aka 'spies' to show off because you'll look like an idiot when you lose it!)

And yes, the river is dirty - with river grass, pee, marshmallows, every other kind of food possible, etc.  But you hope with the quick current flowing, that it makes the water less dirty...you hope at least.  And please take your trash with you!  (The shuttle drivers offer decent plastic trash bags for free, so please take a couple with you on the river!)

They require that children be a minimum of 8 years old AND four feet tall before they'll allow you on the shuttles to take you down to the river.  It can be a fast river, but also because of the mostly high school and college aged crowd frequently and dominating the river.

It's open 9 am to 7 pm, seven days a week.  The last tube rental is at 4 pm, and lost tubes will cost you $20 each.  You need a driver's license for every four or five tube rentals.  And no glass containers!  Your ice coolers will be inspected before you're allowed to board!

We're on the lookout for more rivers to float on!",1
"Food was good. 

I had the Choppino Fruittas de Mare. Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. 

Kid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. 

Bread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.

Now I would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. 

Decor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with 4 retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesn't fit quite right.

Kid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it. Since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations, having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them.

Overall, the food is good, servers friendly but not the family friendly place I usually prefer.",0
"My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign "" Best Sandwich...."" Um, no. If you want, I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak. First, don't wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy. Second, put some meat on there. It was 50% bun.  It should be toasted and crunchy. And price, a 12"" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me. For that price, I was hoping for the best I ever had. Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market.",0
"Been a few times at various times for various reasons.

Food - 4/5
Love the bruschetta, sandwiches are good really no complaints, good alcohol selection. 

Service - 4/5
I always receive good service. 
Valet is always youthful.

Atmosphere - 3/5
Casual, great place for meeting friends. can be a little too busy for my liking.

Price - 3/5
Average I can't really complain.

Overall - I don't go out of my way to go here, but I certainly recommend it.",1
Won't be going there again. Our chicken was pink! Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy.,0
"I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it "" that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back"".",0
Had breakfast this morning while waiting on getting my windows on my car tinted. I had the build your own omelete. I got it with chorizo bell peppers and cheddar cheese. It was pretty good and the portion size was big for the price. They had fresh squeezed orange juice too. Not the best breakfast I've had but it was good.,0
"I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude, I will not go back.  We came in and were given a table, menus were practically thrown at us.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  We asked a woman working there, and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us.  But he was too busy talking.  We got up and left.  No one even said a word when we left.",0
"An interesting concept that didn't end up being what I hoped for.  

I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.

The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.

Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.

Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.

Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.

Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat

Tako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily

The ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.

The dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal.",0
"Lately I have been addicted to a good Caprese style sandwich and Pane Bianco's is AWESOME!  I read the previous reviews so I went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit.  This did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot. I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches.  It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage.  Can't wait for a hopefully air-conditioned expansion.",1
"This place might have one of the best beer selections at a reasonable price in all of Tempe. Possibly in the East Valley. Their food is great too, service is decent, and the daily specials they offer are just plain awesome!",1
"I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites. I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience.

Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper. The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems. There really isn't a bad seat inside the entire place. Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit. The staff is very friendly and talkative.

If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets. The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums. $23 for a hat compared to $41 at Dodgers Stadium.",1
"One of the most memorable breweries I've been to, not because of their personal beer choices but because of how they run the place. They have over 30 beers on tap from all over the country. If that's not cool enough, the entire back wall of the place is refrigerated coolers full of bottles and cans of even more craft brews that you can hand pick to drink in house...OR....build your own 6 pack to carry out. Brews from all over from Epic, to Dogfish, to Maui Brewing, to Sierra Nevada and the list goes on...and on....and on. It really is a nice concept!! Oh....and their food is great too. Mostly your normal bar food but pretty tasty.

As for the service? I was incredibly impressed at how the girls that were serving us really truly seemed to have some serious beer knowledge. They were able to help us pick the right beer for our liking and they were right there when the brews disappeared regardless of the fact the place was packed.

Know before you go: Don't let the exterior fool you! It's a small portion of a strip mall...look hard or you may miss it",1
"Yes, I've had better.

The chai lattes are pretty good, but not worth $4.50 for a large(which was a grande cup size at starbucks).  Prices are just the same as Starbucks, if not more.  And they have a credit card surcharge for less than $5 spent.  I still don't agree with that at any place I go too.  I liked the local artwork displayed.  But not impressed.  If the prices were lower, then I could see coming here more often.",0
"I waited months before finally getting around to coming here, and it wasn't all I had hoped for. Went for my birthday, and got the garlic bread appetizer, wasn't very good and got crumbs all over the table. It had an odd burnt taste. Got the mushroom and steak calzone, which was huge and filling, but very greasy and took a long time to actually get to the table. They claimed it was the Hoagie that one of my friends had that took so long, but it shouldn't take so long to cook a sandwich. Either way, delicious, but nothing too special for the price. I won't likely return here, since some of my friends don't like this place.",0
"Great service by the owner (Nick).  He's very accommodating and aims to please.  Friendly and helpful.  I hadn't had an Indian fry bread in over 10 years.  There were several meat choices to choose from and several vegetables to add on top.  Unfortunately an earlier catering order cleaned them out of re-fried beans and bell peppers.  The salsa was good, spicy but not hot.  The owner kept the place open for me to enjoy my meal while we chatted.  He even stayed open later to feed another customer that walked in after the place had been closed for 10 mins.  He even gave me a coupon for my next visit.  A truly caring owner.  Nice place in a strip mall with plenty of parking.",1
"the folks at national car rental were very accommodating and even helped me upgrade my rental at little cost to me.  if the deal was right, i would definitely use this company again when visiting Phoenix!",1
"I am in town visiting and stopped at Shea for lunch. I actually had a breakfast sandwich/bagel even though it was 1pm (they said you can have breakfast anytime!). 
The service was great and it was very cute inside. There are tables and they have free wi-fi so it would be a great place to meet clients for a casual meeting.
They also have a drive-thru if you want to grab a quick cup of coffee.",1
"So we finally decided to give Cibo another chance and I'm so glad we did!

I love love love their patio. It's very cute and romantic especially with all the lights wrapped around the trees. The heaters keep you warm on a chilly night and it's much quieter than their indoor space. This place is a great date spot. 

We both had the Prosciutto Cruda pizza and had wanted to try the burrata, but unfortunately they'd been out of it for the last week so we ordered the bruschetta instead. Our waiter also recommended the Valpolicella Ripasso, which was ok, but it was a little light for our tastes. The pizza was really good (the fresh ingredients really come through), but we weren't the biggest fans of the crust. I like something more substantial and airy. But  for a thin crust pizza it wasn't soggy at all. A big plus! The bruschetta was also ok (don't get me wrong I still ate all of it and would order it again), but each bite just needs a little more of a punch. 

Service was great and we met Karen, the owner, before we left and she is a doll. We had a much better experience this time around and we will certainly be back.",1
"I think Zipps is alright. I fully remember this being the only decent restaurant near where I lived in North Scottsdale, so it was this or nothing.

Food here is good, though they messed up my order and put sour cream on it...ew. But that's a common error, whatever.

I'm not really a fan of sports, and it was loud in here, (which is to be expected), so that's not particularly my taste. However, I found it to be staffed with friendly people, which brings it from 2 to 3 stars in my book.",0
"What Whattt! Hip hop videos blaring as I get my strike on? Bowling specials after 9pm? Friendly staff? Cheap drink specials from the bar in plastic cups? ASU and working class stiffs co-existing one sweaty bowling shoe at a time? Teenagers making out at the arcarde section?

Loooveeee you, Brunswick!",1
First time eating Chicken and waffles and it was the best time ever.,1
This QT is one of my favorite locations! It is always very clean and the staff is upbeat!,1
"Oh, True Food. I want to love you.

But you make me feel like I'm eating in a cafeteria. WIth such a contemporary menu and a staff full of bright shiny faces this restaurant is just a contradiction in form... the menu and ambience just don't match.

My advice is to sit at the bar. The drinks are well served by pleasant bartenders and do their job, the stools are comfortable, and from that locale you get to skip the experience of having dinner with a room full of strangers right at your elbow.",0
"I have to say they are better than Subway, that's for sure. At least they put meat and cheese and the fixing's on your Sub not like subway where they measure everything and you get home and you pretty much just taste the bread. The staff is young but very polite and helpful. Maybe a little suggestion...if you can make homemade salads like Macaroni, potato salad it would be alot better.",1
"Great soup at a great price.

I go for the veggie soup normally, since I'm a bit leery of the raw meats and strange meatballs you can get.  Their vermicelli is also quite edible.

Service could be a little quicker.

Bring cash if you're spending less than $5 - with pho and water you will pay 3.50 + tax.  Cheapest lunch in town.",1
"Clean, fast, fairly cheap.  I had the Orange chicken and it was good. Liked the brown rice option.   I enjoyed this $6.19 meal much more than the lame sandwich/soup I had at Great Grains yesterday and that cost me $12.25,  I'll be back to Tott's.",1
"Great service by Angela and their Doc
First time I don't have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact
Very enjoyable experience and very quick
Had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away
Definitely recommend",1
"Here's the 1. 2. 3...

1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job.
2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, they're all shitty.
3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno! 

We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!

4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!",0
"One of my fave restaurants! The unlimited salad is a winner. It's delicious! They also have a gluten-free selection that my brother loves! 

For Christmas, they also have some gift card deals.",1
"Chain restaurant that's just about okay for afternoon dining with friends. If I wasn't having beer at lunch I'd probably suggest eating someplace else. Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal. I've eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends.

It is centrally located on the corner of Mill and Fifth Street in downtown Tempe, amongst quite a few other local restaurants. During my most recent visit I ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers. Steak was okay but I wouldn't order it again. Beer was exceptional, so I wasn't unhappy overall.

I love burgers and I think I'll stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future. I can't think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory, nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional. I have almost always eaten here on a Saturday afternoon, and it's typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour. Never had a problem getting a table, which is important since I'm usually heading back for an afternoon conference session.

I love the big glass beer mugs (not sure what size they are) but I can't always down the whole thing during a short lunch break (I'm a lightweight).

Overall, good place to eat if you're hungry and in the downtown area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.",0
"I cannot get enough of LGO.

My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin.

The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody, IMO. Try the Croque M'Dame if you want something really bold. 

The lunch and dinner options are great too. This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time.

The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded. That's the best problem a restaurant can have, so they're probably not too worried about it. The parking situation can become an issue too, but for my time and money, it's worth it.

LGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly.",1
"I've brought my dogs here and met with both Dr. Holmes and Dr. Edwards and they were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Over the last 15 years of living in Phoenix we brought all 6 dogs that we have had in that time to come see them and I wouldn't go anywhere else. This past summer I moved to Boston and regrettably haven't found a quality veterinary hospital like Pecan Grove. Ashamedly, even after talking to my current vet and be unsatisfied with their answers, we called Pecan Grove and Dr. Holmes was very helpful and was even able to reference cases and articles to us over the phone. While the answer we got from our Boston vet sounded more like they were guessing than actually knowing the answer.

Pecan Grove and everyone there is amazing and I wouldn't go anywhere else (had I not moved across the country)",1
"I didn't realize that this store was very close to my home. I used to go to ""Musician's Discount on Southern and Alma School Road. However, I had went there Saturday and it was closed, so I decided to check out what other stores are around. The customer service was good, and they were also helpful regarding some questions that I had regarding electric guitars. I didn't really compare prices to other places, so I cannot honestly respond in price comparison. I had noticed that they had a lot of novelty- shaped guitars. they also seemed to have a large quantity of replacement strings for guitars. They also appear to have a large selection of sheet music.  I recommend checking them out if you are looking for a music (instrument) store near Dobson and Baseline Road in Mesa, Arizona.",1
"I know Kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence.

I have not needed her service's and most of us don't plan on needing an attorney. But I am always reminded by a tagline that Kerrie often mentions. 

""People in crisis need company, Droban & Company"". 

How very true. When that time comes, and in these troubled days, it WILL. You will need good company. I would look for Kerrie to help and so should you.",1
"Get the White Chocolate but leave the Strawberries and Cream flavor, too faux-berry/chemical tasting.",0
"My roommate and I went here for drinks before going to see a show in Phoenix. Pleased to see their happy hour menu still counted on Saturdays, we took advantage of their amazing margaritas. 

I suggest ordering on the rocks with salt. 

Gall Blanco is at the base of the Clarenton Hotel in downtown Phoenix, and is in the most perfect spot for admiring the building from a far. We choose to sit outside which wasn't the best idea because the hostes couldn't figure out how to work the fans and the misters were creating small great lakes on the edge tables, but we weren't uncomfortable.",1
"Don't be confused by the Yelp definition, ""Yay, I'm a fan"",  Lowes gets 4 stars because they have great employees that get me out of there fast!  I'm not one that would typically be classified as ""Handy"", so the fact that I can go into Lowe's, and get someone to give me DIY instructions in about 5 minutes, makes me happy.  I've been to several Lowe's/Home Depot's in the past, but I feel compelled to review this location, because after 10+ trips (mostly on the weekends), I have never had to wait for assistance or behind more than one customer in line.  Also, they get bonus points for not only allowing my pups in the building, but complementing them on their cuteness =).",1
"I see a lot of four stars...perhaps I'm too generous with my five stars. I'm a giver.

Attended a party for Georgie on Friday night and had a great time. 
Easy to find, easy to park, easy to get a drink. 

Plus- HEY they have the same turbo nozzle a/c vents that I have in my home. I could live there. Exposed brick? Me too! Felt right at home.
I love the way they display their art, I'm assuming from local artists. 

I would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking. However, no problems there - thankfully. :)",1
"After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of ""protecting the thumbs."" When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows, she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the ""therapist for [me]."" She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I won't offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money.",0
"I had a lot of fun playing this course today with my 12-year old son (who hits in the low 100s.)  We also played this course back in November when we were here in town and had an equally enjoyable time.

The course is in great shape and we were able to finish our round in around 4-5  hours.  The staff here are very friendly and accommodating and the beverage cart came by around 5 times during our round.  The price they gave us (as return out-of-towners) for a Sunday morning tee-time was incredible - 2 adults at $89 each + $40 rental + FREE junior fees + $15 junior rental.  Other similar quality local courses wanted to charge full fees for juniors for the same tee time, so I really appreciated the gesture. If they keep this policy in tact, this will be my regular course when my son and I come back in town.

As for the course, the early holes are typical resort style holes followed by 5 or so residential public course-style holes. The beauty of this course is the back-9 desert-style holes that wrap around into the south mountain before returning back into the resort with the final par-3 that provides a breath taking semi-panoramic view of the valley from downtown Phoenix to the Superstition Mountains.  I found the back-9 to be short, but very technical, constantly testing my course management abilities - i.e, thought I could hit onto the green (from the whites) on every par-4, but came up short every time.

Would definitely recommend this course for other out-of-towners like me who want to get in a quick round on a nice course.  The pro shop is  small but well-stocked.  The restaurant has patio seating overlooking the first tee and serves some decent food.  However, they need to get better beers on tap (IPAs and microbrews would be nice!.)",1
"Always fresh and friendly.

Food is priced just a skosh above the actual value but, the place is clean, people are nice.

Worth trying?  Yes!

Lunchtime sushi is great.  Teriyaki bowl is good.  

Brown rice extra...booo.  Overall worth the very close the the $9.00 you will spend on lunch at Yogis",1
Very nice and helpful staff. One guys always asks me too many questions but I figured he was just trying to be nice. They're on top of trying to sell you a new phone and service. But when you shoot them down they get off your ass about it.,0
"4.5: The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the location. The view from the patio is pretty much parking lot and the backs of buildings. 

But, holy cow! The wine selection is VERY good. The staff are friendly and helpful and make excellent suggestions (thanks for the zinfandel tip! YUMMM). The prices are fair too!

And, as much as I love green chile, my new fave is the fig and gorgonzola app. Still a pannini... I didn't know blue cheese could get that creamy when it melted!

Man, I wish this place was closer... I'll still be back!",1
"This might be a good way to kill time if you're near the airport, the food really wasn't that great. It tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time. I had the caldo 7 mares and it was lukewarm, wayyy too salty, and the shrimp were mushy. It was pretty gross. The carne asada tacos were mostly gristle, and I couldn't really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them. For $20, I could've gotten much better Mexican food somewhere else.",0
"I love Christmas-time and I especially love it because I know that Luminarias is back and this year it's better than ever! The staff and volunteers at the DBG do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden. Between the well-lit paths (with Luminarias of course), helpful staff and amazing acts, this is an event not to be missed! I consider this to be the ultimate activity for adults. It's romantic if you're on a date, it's festive if you're with your family and it's just pure fun if you're with friends. 

You enter the park to be immediately greeted by hundreds of meowganificant Luminarias lighting up the entire garden. Cocktail stations lie in every knook and cranny and they serve delicious festive drinks like my favorite, hot cocoa and raspberry vodka! If you're hungry, they sell food throughout the garden at two locations. Then there are the performers. The DBG does an amazing job of bringing in musicians of every shape and size. Whether it's a trio of Christmas carolers, a mariachi band or a lively Jazz band, they have bands in every corner lighting up the night! I am also continuously impressed with the acoustics of the garden. With so many live acts in one area, you can barely hear a specific act until you are in that area. Their event planners did an amazing job! 

Luminarias is my favorite Arizona activity during the holidays and I can't wait to go back next year!!",1
"I came here with a friend who has been here many times and recommended it.  I wasn't disappointed.  First, we came during the lunch rush and it was busy.  However, we were still seated immediately and served by a friendly waitress quickly.  The food then came out in about 5 minutes!  I had the rib tip plate, and it was very good.  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich which was also good.  It's out off the beaten path but worth the trip.  When you pull into a place out in a strange location, and it's packed?  Good sign.",1
"I love this store for years now. I discovered it here.
The candles are wonderful. I love the little travel sampler kit.

"So I e-mailed East Maryland the same afternoon as my visit, explaining that I was disappointed that the coupon I had given them was not honored, and they e-mailed me back before the end of the day, apologizing and letting me know that my Visa would be credited the amount of the coupon. 

Then they called today to see how the boys were all doing after their shots, and acknowledged the bill issue again, and hoped that everything had been settled to my satisfaction.

This kind of immediate and friendly follow-up redeemed them and gained them another star.",1
"""trendy, loud-music, ok-sushi!"" - 2/5

When we lived right across the street from the Sushi Brokers, J and I used to go there at least once a month for its happy hour. We probably had been there at least 8 times with friends and family. I have to say that the quality was good for the start but went downhill since then. The price was right if you go during the happy hour. Other time, kinda expensive with the quality and service. It was a seen-to-be-seen place with ok-quality sushi.",0
"Had breakfast at Joe's Diner this morning.  I had the number 2, and a side of potatoes.  It was supposed to come with 2 bacon and 2 sausage, but for some reason, mine came with four pieces of bacon.  I didn't question it because the waitress seemed a little absent minded and we had to ask for a side that she had already forgotten.  The few times she came to check on us, she would ask if everything was ok and would walk away so fast that we couldn't tell her what we needed.  The positive here is that the pancakes were REALLY tasty.   I would have given Joe's 4 stars if the service was better, but I think there could be some improvement there.",0
"Could have been 4 stars... 

I went here for the first time last Friday. 

It was busy, but they don't have that many tables and there were at least 4 waitresses on that I could see. Our services was sooooooo slllllllow. Like painfully slow. We waited a long time for refills, a long time for our food, a long time for the check to come. It was really annoying. Our waitress was nice, but slow. 

Onto the food! We got an order of wings and an order of the fried zucchini. The zucchini was really good but holy hell she should have warned us that it had JUST came out of the fryer that may have been heated by lava. I popped one of those bad boys in my mouth and immediately felt the skin on the roof of my mouth start to come off. Once the burning subsided I was good to go. I hear the wings were tasty, They were really big (I just don't eat wings) 

I ordered the fish and chips. So yummy! Our friend got the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of grilled asparagus. LOVE that they offer grilled veggies as a side! I snuck a couple asparagus and they were tasty. Hubs got the ribs, it was a huge pile of meat on a plate. He loved it! 

I will for sure go back, the food was really great, I will just know not to expect quick service.",0
"The food...delicious. The atmosphere...relaxing. The service...pretty spot-on. The pricing...ehhh, not my thing here. The only way I was able to eat here was because a family friend treated my family out. But if you're looking to spoil yourself or anyone you know, with food, this is the place to do it. 

I ordered the Chicken Romano (pan-seared with a blend of romano cheese & panko breadcrumbs, with lemon shallot butter, tomatoes, asparagus & yukon gold mashed potatoes). The chicken pan-seared with bread crumbs was great to eat, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.The asparagus... I've had better, but the yukon gold mashed potatoes were silky, buttery and made perfectly. They went well with the chicken romano.

My dad ordered the NY Strip, and they were kind of enough to cut it up for him since he was handicapped. They checked up on us frequently. THE ONLY THING I WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT WAS THEY ACTUALLY CAME UP AND ASKED IF I WAS DONE (ALREADY GRABBING AT MY PLATE) WHEN THE FORK WAS STILL IN MY MOUTH BECAUSE APPARENTLY I WAS STILL EATING. Since that ruined my entire experience thus far, I just told them to take it.

In addition, the entire table got an order of the unlimited salad bar. The salad bar was great, but nothing like the choices offered at Souplantation. Also, because I ate the salad beforehand, I wasn't able to finish off the main entree I ordered. 

Will I be back? Probably not.",0
"Fun atmosphere, great H/Hour prices. We took my 89 year old padre there and he had a ball looking at all of the stuffed animals. Had the fried shrimp, curds (what are curds really?) and the burger/brats and beer for only $6. Asked for med. rare on the burger, but it came out medium, no pink. I will try rare next time. 3 Blind Moose house wine for 3 bucks. 3-7pm everyday, life is good in Scottsdale.
Stay thirsty my friends!",1
"The new Harkins Cine Capri, one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace, boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks. Moviegoers can order brownie bites, mozzarella sticks and pizza.

The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy. And the screen is huge. This is my new favorite movie theatre.",1
"I've ordered cookies from Cookies by Design many times and they never disappoint. I have worked with this store as well as stores across the country when ordering for the people I work with and people I love. Everyone has always said how beautiful the cookies look but even better, how great they taste. You won't be disappointed. :)",1
This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it.,1
"I've been to multiple Buca di Beppo locations in several cities.  They are a good place to go with a large group.  We went to this location with a group of nine.  The menu was typical.  We ordered the seafood trio, which was nice, and the fried mozzarella, which was also good.  The Caesar's salad was also good.  We ordered pasta entree's and chicken, all of which were served up warm and in plentiful portions.  We left with a fair amount of food.  I would give the food four stars.  However, I would give the service one star.  Two in our party ordered cocktails.  Five of us ordered wine with dinner.  All drinks arrived together with our entrees.  We did not get enough dinner plates.  We did not get enough wine glasses, and had to wait for three more.  Three entrees arrived together, and we had to wait about five minutes for the fourth to arrive.  We had to ask three times for boxes to put our leftovers in.  We were never asked if we wanted dessert.  If the service were spot on, the rating would be much higher, but, I can't justify it.",0
"The obsession started about 2 yrs ago and I haven't looked back since...
Started with getting them catered for lunch, then a trip here or there to the restaurant. SO. GOOD. The bread is amazing, but the love, sweat, tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting. Hmmm, now I am wondering what it is they put in there?? Anyway, I won't think too long and hard about that one. But tomorrow I'm definitely heading back for the Vermonter, gotta feed the addiction.",1
"VERY BAD SERVICE + BELOW AVERAGE SUSHI = 2 STARS.

The 2 stars is because the quality of food is below average and not that great. The Salmon looks like its been on the plates forever and has a real slimy look. I've had way better sushi in some all you can eat places!! Basically the only good thing is the gimmick with the conveyor belt. I would advise the reader to save his/her money for a better sushi place like Kabuki.

The next bad thing about this place is the atrocious service. They never bring you the drinks or seat you in a timely manner. God knows what the waitresses do over there...they run around as if its their first day at work and never get anything done like clear tables, get checks etc. I've been here a couple of times and I saw that the 2nd time, the patrons were not even waiting for the waitresses...they formed a line at the cashier like Denny's.",0
"After long debate of where to have lunch, I am glad that I stopped into The Greek Pita.  

I had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions.  The gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings.  The pita was soft and fresh. The Tzatziki sauce  has a nice tang to it.  It tasted light, cool, and creamy.   The total cost was $5.74 + tax.  I left with a very happy belly.",1

"I have been exploring more of the park recently.  I want to add that the National Trail (which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other) is a real gem.  The views on this trail are outstanding, and on the western half, you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half.  Highly recommended.",1
"I took a cooking class with Chef Eddie Matney (Eddie's House Restaurant) and his recipe called for Vanilla bean olive oil from the Olive Mill. First off, what he made with this recipe was phenomenal much thanks to that smooth vanilla olive oil in there! I decided to google this place only to find out that Chef Beau Macmillan acclaimed a the kalamata sandwich from there as his ""bad boy favorite."" I don't know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since I've had his food and was quite impressed. 

I decided to make the 45 minute drive from Scottsdale out there on a Sunday afternoon to get my olive oil and try this kalamata sandwich. Such a cool atmosphere inside. It's like a trader joes/gift shop/paradise bakery all with a rural, kinda on the farm feel. You could easily kill an hour here just looking around at all the stuff for sale.  

I couldn't believe the kalamata sandwich! If you go there and order anything else....you're wrong. Freshest ingregients I've ever tasted. I feel like the pork could have just been butchered 5 minutes prior to me ordering it and the vegetables just picked from their garden (which they do have there). 

Pretty cool how you can sample the endless flavors of olive oil there. Got myself the vanilla bean and the blood orange as well. Make for some unstoppable pancakes. 

Tried the gellato and wasn't all that impressed. But in all due fairness, I'm not exactly sure what real gellato is supposed to taste like since all I've had is gelleto spot and grateful spoon.

Definitely worth the drive! Great place to bring the family.",1
"I met some friends last night at Cadillac Ranch and this was my first time going. The space has a very odd layout, but there are two bars (one inside and one outside on the patio) and both have plenty of TVs to watch. There is also a very cliche mechanical bull, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one rode it while I was there.

Service at the bar was really good, but when our group moved to a table, service became spotty. We had two servers for our table of 11 and one would take a drink order or would be asked for something and then not deliver it or something would get missed...the two servers just didn't coordinate very well. Luckily we weren't in a hurry and were a pretty laid back group. I only ate the Cadillac salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, cheese and croutons) and it was a nice size for $7.95. However, and maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but I hate when restaurants put the dressing on for you! I prefer for it to come on the side, as it does in almost every single restaurant I have ever been to, so I can put on as much as I would like. I did try a few of my friend's fries and they were good...not oily and for fries, they were actually pretty light. As a note, for groups, they put an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill, not the standard 18% most other places do.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as I was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were. However the three stars I am giving Cadillac Ranch are for their happy hour:

$2 domestics
$3 imports
$3 Fat Tire bottles
$3 Flavored Smirnoff Vodka drinks
$3 Margaritas
$4 Rum (Captain Morgan)
$5 Vodka Martinis
$3.50 to $5ish select appetizers (there are about four or five)

I'm always happy when I can get Stella drafts for cheap. Also, according to the bartender, one of the margaritas they serve can only be purchased a maximum of 4 times by one person because it is so strong. One piece of advice: If you start at the bar and move to a table, close your tab at the bar even if they offer to transfer it to your table. We had a huge mess last night and some people overpaid and some of us underpaid.",0
"These girls know how to make working out awesome and fun!!!! Quality instructors, will not disappoint!!! Lots of variety!!!",1
"Eva's seems to be the place we go to every time we visit family in Casa Grande now.  It is a pretty consistent experience, and that's good enough for us when we're out of town.

The food is pretty good.  Their sauces are on the spicy side, but that's ok with us.  They're still packed with flavor, and they compliment the meals.  The carne asada burrito (enchilada style) is a large portion.  Again, the sauce elevates it to being a little bit better than average tasting.  The  cheese enchiladas with their white jalapeño sauce were a little bit small, but very good.  The rice that the combinations get served with is just so-so.  Their chips are fine, the salsa is a little bit weak.  The food quality is average overall.

The service has never been that good.  They're not particularly attentive or personable.  I felt like we were a little bit of a hassle at times.  The last waiter we had advised us to go with a combo plate because it would be cheaper, when it turns out, if you do the math yourself, it was about $3 more expensive.  The manager's solution was to take $1 off the bill, and then comp our sodas.  Hmm, ok.  A warning then to you all out there that are watching your cost.  Add your a la carte items up yourself and don't get pressured into the combo, especially if you don't want rice and/or beans anyway.

The menu is also slightly confusing.  The prices are average.  The decor is nice.  The restaurant looks like it can serve large groups and parties very well.  Overall, Eva's seems to be a safe place to enjoy a meal, and we'll go there next time we head up that way.",0
"Bar & restaurant.  In that order.

Danielle Ammaccapane was an LPGA player, graduated from Thunderbird HS just a few miles away...as did her LPGA-player sister, Dina.  I went to THS and graduated same year as Danielle (1983), just sayin...

I love this place.  It's a great ""Cheers"" style bar, as much as one loathes hearing that type of characterization.  Italian food here is solid, and the cocktails have a punch.  Nice place to watch football at the bar when by oneself, too.",1
"I read the reviews on Charleston's and decided to take the plunge even though there were a few negative reviews. I am a visitor to AZ for business and have grown so tired of restaurant food. 

I love salad and find most places don't know how to make a decent salad, the one at Charleston's was so good with fresh tomato and egg and the creamy garlic dressing!! Yummy.

The filet was medium well and I not being a steak fan usually need some type of sauce (except for Ruth/Chris), but this steak was really good. I took my meal to go and couldn't wait to get the hotel because it smelled so good.

Last but not least was the baked potato. The salt on the outside, I quote someone else, ""genius"". 

I used curbside to go - AWESOME.

If you haven't tried this place, go - despite the few bad reviews. I am now a fan and will do something I rarely do - eat the same meal two days in a row (I am not kidding, it was good!!)",1
"Sadly, I have to join the crowd on this one. I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away, but instead just reminded me all over again. Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink.",0
"Went here for the first time last week and had a great experience. The restaurant was very clean, the service was great. The best part? The food. I've been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food I've had in a restaurant (and this from a pregnant woman no less ;)

I had the fried chicken tenders, cheesy grits and fried okra. First, the food came out piping hot, I mean steaming and hot to the touch. The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy. The grits were cooked to perfection- dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist. And the okra was fantastic, too. It didn't hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar, either. 

I will be back. a lot :)",1
"I've decided to completely write this place off, and here is why you should too:

THREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed, all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open. If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs, you'd better call first because this place cannot be trusted. I've wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed. 

Vitamin T will fail, there I said it.",0
"So I was like a lemming trying this after Man vs Food when recently visiting Phoenix.  But......  the kid is right.... everything on the Del Rey torta works together.  And it is HUGE.  And it's great too.  Wonderfully constructed, just enough of everything and not too much of anything.  I also had the watermelon juice (interesting, huh)?  One strange thing.... first Mexican restaurant I've ever been in that didn't have chips and salsa.  Only real downside is that the service is a bit slow.  But they're slammed and deservedly so.",1
Great for Saints and LSU games.,0
"I was hella skeptical that a Phoenix fast food Mexican joint could top a Mission taqueria.  Rivas pleasantly surprised me.  I chose the two burritos with chicken meal that came with rice and beans.  Standard, but fulfilling rice and refried beans.  The burrito was a breath of fresh grilled veggies.  A warm tortilla filled with chicken, peppers and onions.  So simple and yet so mouth watering.  Best part was that the burrito was so big that I got to save the second one for my flight back to SF.  Oh, and this whole package was under $7.",1
"Great surprise-- I have driven by this place several times-- food was excellent-- I had the Enchantment platter-- just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming-

Cool cave-like atmosphere inside and fun patio area-- I will definitely be back and bring out of towners",1
"I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.

First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.

Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.

Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.

Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   

Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.
No value

Food:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.
My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.

Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.

Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!",0
"Excellent service and food           

enjoyed live music on patio",1
This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...,1
".:chomp:. this is one .:mmmghgh:. good burger .:sllluuuurrrpp:.
It's got a great combination of yumminess with a side of .:chomp:. awesomeness. The burgers are great and .:chomp:. perfect. 

The custard is great .:lick:. and diabetic friendly .:mmmmmmm:.(They have no sugar added custard). i would definitely recommend this place! .:lick:.",1
"* 5 stars for uniqueness - This place has very interesting food and flavors that aren't common around here.

* 5 stars for the staff - Everybody was very fast and friendly.

* 5 stars for coolness of the location and the establishment - I mean it is pretty cool that this place is in a nicely redone 100-year-old house in a cool part of downtown Phoenix.  Parking is a pain though.

However.....

Besides feeling hip, cool, urban and trendy; I also felt hungry and ripped off after leaving.  Sure, I could sit there for hours sipping saki and trying every one of their tapas and probably be ok hunger-wise but  I would NOT be ok with the $100+ tab per person that it would surely be.  For me this is more of a fun/interesting place to go before you go out to dinner.",0
"The Breakfast Club is as good as you'll find. The blueberry pancakes are superb, their coffee is beyond description. For a change of pace, try their Eggs Benedict, Southwestern style. A GREAT spot within walking distance...a beauty.",1
"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona. 

The service was great as well! The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good.

*****UPDATE***** 
Looks like they went out of business. Haven't been open for two weeks now.....",1
"As promised, here's my ""make-up visit"" update.

Things improved dramatically since the last time I went. Firstly, our server wasn't an upsell machine. In fact, she was very polite and concerned about our order (Mine was particularly attentive with replacing and putting on the side of some ingredients, and she and the staff double-checked with me before and afterward to make sure everything was hunky-dory). The food was great, as always; had my first MM calzone, and I actually liked it better than the delicious pizza they have. 

No mention of this in my first reviews, as I don't recall going to the bathroom, but their bathroom is great! Ha, maybe TMI for a food review; however, really impressed with the privacy of the stalls.

Back to more relevant things, I was confused (though I suppose not off-put) about the happy hour rules (we went after 10, which is advertised as HH); apparently it isn't half-price appetizers on some nights and instead is a slice of pepperoni or something for $3? Not sure I call that a deal, but I guess beers being half-off makes up for it.

I was kind of disappointed they didn't have Fall Woodchuck as I went during their fall-themed beers time, but I guess it's kinda a pussy beer anyway (I'll qualify myself by saying I'm more of a straight liquor guy, but Woodchuck is my guilty pleasure). The waitress had a nifty hand-written updated list she kept with her, and while I'm not a beer man I can appreciate the effort in something like that.

Anyway, like I said, they seem to have really improved here and I definitely recommend them; for the food if not the service. BON APPETIT!",1
"The service was great! We had a large group & had called prior to make a reservation. Our table was ready when we arrived & they had assigned 2 servers. They were both incredibly pleasant & attentive. Our food came out really quickly & no one had any complaints. I wouldn't say this was authentic Mexican food, but it doesn't have to be. A good time was had by all :)",0
"The lemon grass pork is 2 stars on a generous day. Disappointing, since they tout their Vietnamese selections as being specialties. The pork was tough and the noodles were more like lo mein than the vermicelli type rice noodles I was expecting. Portions are certainly generous enough... I like that you can make your own rice bowl. That's the direction I recommend if you come here.",0
"This is a great place to take your time and enjoy someones company.
The food is fresh and the service always friendly.
If you are looking to be fed fast this is not the place to go.
Fondue is fun!
If you have the time and the money this is a place to have a great evening.",1
"I had such high hopes for this restaurant as I was coming in from out of town and a friend who grew up in Scottsdale recommended.  It was a disappointment.  The food was just ok - nothing special.  The sticky buns everyone raved up - did not come out as an appetizer or even after meal treat - oddly came out with our dinner so it was basically over looked.  The restaurant was not crowded yet we were sat at one of the few tables without a view.  My biggest problem was the flies.  They were everywhere and we were seated INSIDE the restaurant not on the patio.  When you go to an up-scale restaurant to celebrate a special occassion, who wants to be shooing flies away from their food.  It was really disgusting and distracting.  For the money we spent to eat here I felt ripped off.  We ate at the Roaring Fork the next night and it was superb so if you are going to be in the area - you should consider alternatives who have better food, better service and a more pleasing environment - don't waste your money on this place.",0
"This is my first year participating in Arizona to sell clothing, just wandering how busy its goona be in there ??? little worried, can any one reply me ??",0
"Food is top notch and within a good price range for a weekend breakfast.  I dropped a star because it's always so crowded there's usually a line to order your food.  That and they're closed on Sundays.  It's a perfect weekend breakfast, how can you be closed on Sundays?!  But I eat here all the time.",1
"Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10/31/2012. Therefore we were near to Abuelo's for lunch. Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good! We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP.

We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear.

Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service!

Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelo's for a great lunch or dinner!",1
This is my neighborhood grocery store. It's at the two locations I shop at most. It's always clean and well stocked and I never have to wait in line for very long.,1
"We brought the entire family to Giuseppe's last night for a pre-Thanksgiving meal... yes, that's right - my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today!  We brought a ton of wine and had a great time.  Franco was our waiter - and I'm guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him, that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too.  Nice eye candy!

I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit.  We usually start with a Giuseppe's Salad and finish with a dessert to share.  My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa.

Pasquale (pictured above) is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time.  

Since I'm writing this review on Thanksgiving, I want to give thanks to Pasquale and Ristorant Giuseppe for all the good times I've had there and all of the good times to come!  Salud!",1
"The Vig Uptown is on my list of very favorite places to go in PHX! 

I'll keep this one simple: great food and awesome atmosphere that's chill, not pretentious, but still super cool keeps me coming back to The Vig Uptown.Sweet Central Phoenix vibe and location. I like it that this place is close enough to the Central corridor but also close enough if I'm headed over from Scottsdale or other PHX hoods. 

Happy hour is a great deal with half off all appetizers, 5 dollars for any burger and fries on Mondays after 4pm to close, and a stellar menu of comfort food that's still inventive. I adore the wings aka ""vings,"" the artichoke dip, the salads, the burgers, sweet potato fries,and anything I've ever tried here. Other good things: nice patio area that's really indoors for hot PHX days, fireplace area, a bocce ball court, the fact that it's in a repurposed 1950s bank building with a retro feel, and the Vig Rig: on weekends they will pick up/drive home if you want to drink a bit!

Only knocked them a star because: sometimes the service falls off when they're busy - I've waited way too long more than once just for a salad, etc. If it was only once or twice I wouldn't have knocked them a star...but they're usually busy and the service usually isn't very good. If they can fix that a bit, 5 stars for sure.",1
"Waffle Houses are bomb but this one is my favorite.  Not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit.  There are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise.  

As far as the food, the prices are cheap, the menu is semi-a-la-carte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect.  This is THE Waffle House to visit.  Go now, do it.  How good does a waffle sound right now anyways?  That's right, Pretty Damn Good.",1
"This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I paid $20.00 for a show and dinner. I received the show only because it was from an outside source. The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served. They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying ""f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life. Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund? unbelievable",0
Great prices with great selection. Great for your everyday shopping needs.,1
"Me and three girlfriends headed to La Bocca for Happy Hour after reading all the wonderful Yelp reviews. I was really excited on my way there, but left feeling underwhelemd. 

For me, it felt a little big, commercial, the decor was kinda cheesy - think red leather chairs, Pier1 Important wall sconces, even a ""VIP"" looking lounge in red velour. Hardly, original or intimiate enough to be considered an authentic ""wine bar"" in my opinion. If you're a regular at chain restaurants you'll probably think this is a cute place (call me a snob, whatever). Let's talk about the wine list at this ""wine bar"" --- it was okay but they were out of our first two choices of red - not ideal for a wine bar. Then, we ordered our bruchetta for our table of four and were annoyed when it came out cut in halves. Knowing we were sharing the plate, maybe the waitress should have clued us in? We ended up ordering a second board for the table so we could each try the variety. I do have to say, the bruchetta was good. 

We were clearly there for happy hour on a Wednesday night (which I do love goes until 6:30pm) but found it a little rude that the waitress came by six minutes after the mark to ask if we wanted a second round. There was no grace period so we paid full price. We did notice, that our full price glasses of wine were filled to the brim - so maybe 1/2 price = have the wine? 

Don't get me wrong... the place is cute enough, would def seem like a ""fancy date night place"" if I were still in college. I'd go again with girlfriends but won't be racing back with my husband. 

I wish we would have tried more food because that seems to be the key to this place. Ambiance and service are good - not great. Oh, and the music could use some updating. The playlist was... eh... interesting 

Maybe it's my love of Postino or maybe its because I was on Mill Avenue I was instantly judging the place.",0
"Meh.  Met up with a few friends here and sat on the patio on a Saturday night around 8.  There are no heaters, which would be ok if it was a nice fall day or a summer night, but i was a bit cold towards the end.  There is indoor seating as well so this shouldn't be a deal breaker.  I ordered a few nice glasses of red, one pinot noir and one petite syrah.  I ordered the tuna salad and the bf ordered the grilled cheese.  It was just ok, and so was the service.  Our plates sat on the table for over 20 minutes after we were finished before they were cleared. Cute place, good music, not a huge variety on the menu, just salads and sandwiches.  I would likely go to humble pie next door next time while in the area which is how we spotted The Main Ingredient in the first place!",0
"Overall I liked this place and glad it is in the neighborhood.  The carne asada burrito was good and the ceviche was pretty tasty.  However, it seems that this is about all there is to the menu.  

I was not a fan of the set-up of the restaurant.  It was way too crowded - yes it was lunch, but the flow could have been a lot better.  Overall, I will return when in the mood for carne asada.  Hopefully the kinks will get worked out over time and until then I look forward to supporting a local restaurant.",0
"I'm not a fan of ice cream, I just don't find it appealing and it's too high in calories/saturated fat. However I do love frozen yogurt, and ironically it's much less fattening, yet more satisfying. At 25 calories an ounce, Golden Spoon's is the best around. There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies.

Even though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that.",1
"Just as good a Pizzeria Bianco! But with the added bonus of not having to wait for hours and hours. Granted there may still be a wait here but you aren't fighting tourist for tables at this joint. It's more of a local fav! 

Fresh gourmet toppings and very good crust! Personally a big fan of the garden seating! There was a longer than normal wait for the food however, the server was very attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance as we had drinks in garden. I would not recommend this place for a quick meal but it's perfect if you bring friends and want to have time to relax and enjoy conversation!",1
"Slices Pizza is pretty good, not the best though. But if you are on Mill Ave its the best Pizza option.  Uno's is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in Phoenix.  If the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars.  If you are in Tempe a much better Pizza place is Red Devil Pizza about 5 minutes South.",0
"This review is for Gil's catering - which is fantastic.  

Our perfect event for a new product launch needed to be casual, but tasty and high quality.  Gil's was all of these things.  The food presentation is pretty without pretension.  Everything was fantastic.  Best of all, Gil worked with us to plan an event within our budget.  

Fare is traditional with a tasty twist - our group loved the chimis, taquitos, enchiladas and especially the chips.  

We expected 2 servers and 4 showed up - including Gil.  They over delivered in every sense.",1
"Consistently great service. Pretty standard food quality for a high end chain. Have really enjoyed this location both when busy and quiet.  Cocktails aren't particularly exciting or strong, but a great wine selection makes up for it.  Best way to describe the experience, 'consistent'.",1
"Self service, good mix n match favors and lots of goodies. Be careful, the bowls are big and you can easily pay more for a single serving than a gallon of Breyers at the grocery store.  

Very dog friendly place. They will bring out a bowl of water and a small softserve with dog treats stuck in it for your little dog.",1
Great flavors even though there aren't many to choose from! Fresh fruit is such an awesome feature as most places are def not and limited to the healthy choices of topping! I visit as often as I can!!,1
"This store made me feel like I had died and went to fabric heaven.  There is just so much beautiful, wonderful, amazing fabric.  I dropped a pretty penny- but I've already used some of my perfect fabric for great projects.

The place is clean, the staff is super friendly and patient- especially with newbies like me.  When I brought 10 different reams of fabric up and had to stop and really think about how much I needed- patience came with a smile.  It seems like everything (even the high end designers) are around $10/yard.

If you get bogged down with all the fabric that you are falling in love with, they have a cute little table set up with these funny little signs that say ""get your paws off my fabric"" which made me chuckle.  Maybe I'm turning into an old lady who loves silly stuff like that.

Despite the somewhat sketchy location, 35th Ave. Sew and Vac is my new go-to for fabric!",1
"I was contacted by the manger at this location cause of my bad review, I am really for proactive owners. I really need to go back to this location to give them another try since the first time I went there it was really good. I was given a gift card to wipe out what I paid for the last meal as kinda of do over. I will be back Anthony and I will let you know how my next visit is.",1
"I have been through plenty of airports around the world and I have to say that this one is on the better end. It is easy to navigate, clean (from what I have experienced), and makes getting to and returning rental cars a breeze. 

As in most airports, those who are not used to recent travel REALLY hold up the security check line. I would think they would want to be prepared and get through that check as quickly as possible and I held my breath when one young lady came back out in search of a 1 quart zip lock bag, fearing that we would have to evacuate the terminal for her breech, but we were all able to make our flights. 

A word to pet lovers who insist on traveling with their four-legged friends: allergies and asthma plague a large number of people and difficulty breathing caused by YOUR pet presents an unexpected glitch in their travel day. 

PLEASE CONSIDER LEAVING YOUR PETS AT HOME. An unplanned trip to the ER as a result of YOUR inconsideration should be YOUR responsibility. What do you say about that, health care providers??? 

In all my travels, this has been the only time I have been stuck behind the hairiest cat I have ever seen in my life because its owners had more baggage than humanly possible to manage. Clueless to others distress as the owners, their pet left wheezing, sneezing, itching, gasping travelers in its wake. Are you from Naperville?",0
"Yeah...notsomuch.

Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...

- The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.

- This place is a disorganized mess. 

- There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.

- The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like ""um...there might be a better way to do this...""

- Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?

So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me ""You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it."" I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said ""NO"" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word ""water"") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.

I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!"" 

I said ""It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion."" (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)

She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4"" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone. 

I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes, yo.",0
Great place to grab a coffee with decent prices and a great atmosphere for sitting down to do some work or catch up with a friend. Would definitely recommend!,1
"NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.  She rules!
She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.  It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.  In the center is a PILE (a total monton!) of grilled chicken.  It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.  It had been marinated, too.  And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was!
I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.  
This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for 2 hours.  I have made a mess in my ""Make me Yelp"" boyshorts.",1
"Great library...take your canned food to donate all during APRIL and they wave off your fines- GREAT cause, GREAT deal and now fine free!",1
"Had the pleasure of enjoying House of Tricks last night, for the second time in the past twelve months.

With a party of six, I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices.  The restaurant, found in Tempe near ASU, is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery, the setting works quite well.  

Our party was seated immediately and without problem, the night was off to a solid start.  Our waitress, Jamie, was both friendly and courteous.  Jamie had a great understanding of the menu, the specials and especially the wine.  Her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly.  Each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went.

I had the pork belly, on Jamie's suggestion. Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They weren't cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening.

For the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.  This was a real treat, cooked evenly, tender and tasty.  Other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna, the salmon, and the duck.  The tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied.  My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish, she found the duck slightly fatty.  All around, the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned.  

With little room left for dessert, we ordered three selections for the table to share.  All were good and once again our plates were cleaned off.  The dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces.  

All in all, this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service.  I would eat here again and recommend you to do the same.",1
"This is my first review on yelp. My wife and I were looking for a place we could take the kids for ice-cream tonight after visiting bass pro shops. Did a search on yelp found this place.
I've got to say I've never tried gelato before but my wife thought it looked good. I got peanut butter and banana, the wife got PB and choc Oreo, and my kids got Oreo and choc chip... As my 5 yr old said, this place is off the hook. We will definitely come back.",1
"My wife and I have going to this restaurant on Thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice.  A couple weeks ago I went there for the usual but there was an NFL game and a World series game on and the restaurant was busy.  I put my name in and waited for my wife and the table.  30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available.  Hostess said I can't seat you unless your other party shows up first.  I called my wife, she cancelled.  Hostess would not seat me as a single...TERRIBLE..Hostess did not tell me this when I first put my name in.  WON'T BE GOING TO ANY OF THE ZIPPS EVER AGAIN.",0
"TIP #1 to Mesa-Gateway fliers: This is the ONLY bar at the airport, so live it-love it. 
Food is great. The burgers can be made low-carb - especially great this gurl! 
TIP #2: Food can be ordered to go...",1
"Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation. Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate. 

Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us. 

I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro. 

They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.

Update 11/8/2010
Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.  

We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.

Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.

We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.

Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.",0
"Mediocre, bland, low quality food topped off with painfully slow service.  I worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally ""just in case it's gotten better"", for reasons I could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table.  The salsa and rice are usually good, but that's the most I have to offer.",0
"Jan Ross has one of the best selections of crystals I've seen - they literally had every crystal I was looking for, and I subsequently left as a satisfied customer. Friendly staff too.",1
"OK guys (and gals too), I know size isn't everything, but OMG, this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it!  We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/2 orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni ""D"".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.

I am definitely going here again, what a find!",1
"I was working in the area and craving a healthy salad for lunch. My usual love affair salad place was too far so my colleague and I decided to try Jason's Deli. He'd gone there for sandwiches many times and never tried the salad bar. For about $7.50 after tax you can get a pretty good selection of veggies, dressings, even a few pre-made pasta salad options. They also have crackers and mini muffins. The salad area seemed clean and well stocked. There were enough tables to sit, even during the lunch rush.",1
"A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!",1
Finally veered away from my usual sandwich or cold rice noodles and ordered the beef pho....darn it was good!,1
"Great customer service, perfect dining area! This lightly dimmed pizzeria is nothing like the other high top table pizza places, the staff and waitress' are really friendly with along great customer service! (and I am picky with people who serve at restaurants!) this place is great for family or even with friends to get a great bite to eat. I ordered the side ""Chef Eric's Caesar salad and thin crust cheese with pepperoni"" I highly recommend For GREAT pizza! However the guy who was going to bring my pizza dropped it...but made it up by giving me Nicole's Notable Chocolate Chip cookies :)",1
"Pho is great every time, service is fast and friendly, potstickers are the best I have ever had and they are only $3.50.  Plus %10 discount for Intel employees.",1
"The place is nothing special, you can even think there is nothing going on there as it is almost hidden. Once you are in, you still won't believe there is something worthy. Sit and try one of their gyros, hummus or the vegetarian combo! All tasty and well served. After that you can check and buy some interesting to impress your friends next time!",1
"Harvest hash is incredible - ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side. 
Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast!!!  Sooooo good!
It's a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly.
A gem!!!",1
"Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  It's epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....

Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled ""dentists for anxious patients"", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.

I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they're clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didn't even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.

Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now here's my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd's and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didn't try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn't quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!

I have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!",1
"I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place. The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong. The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale. 

Last night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air.",1
I always just get one thing from Vietnamese places and its their rice dish with grilled pork chop and egg cake. This place does it goooood. You get a reasonable amount for the price and the fish sauce is just right.,0
"I've always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa aren't good, the food is not likely to be good either.  I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa.  Rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the Biltmore I expected so much better.  Just as a note, when it comes to Mexican food, I'm super critical.  This place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the Midwest.",0
"Old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection.  You will pay more, but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials.  Often there are coupons for BOGO or a few bucks off your purchase.  They also have a good selection of beer and wine, side dishes, and some supplies for home BBQ and smoking.  After reading the other reviews, I know my hubby and I need to try the jerky.  We always enjoy shopping at Von Hanson's.",1
"I didn't stay here, but patronized their restaurant. The servers were very polite and accommodating. They frequently refilled our drinks and aimed to serve by making sure the fireplaces were working. It's a nice place to hang at if you have a reason to be here.",1
"I have not been bowling in 24 years,so you can imagine i was worried. But, this place is clean and fresh. On certain nights,(Monday)and a few others you pay a $5.00 cover charge,then everything is $1.00 .Food ,drinks , games and most important bowling games. The instructions were easy. We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball. Lots to choose from! Lots of fun!!!   It was a $20.00 night for 2 of us. The workers are very helpful and Friendly. Bathrooms were also clean. I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little gross.But, other than that it was a great time.",1
"Watched the Ignite Phoenix #7 viewing party here on Friday Night. Thanks for hosting.  Had a lovely Americano while I watched.  Great drinks and cool interior.  The other guests seems to be talking about their food as being very good.  This is a little out of my neighborhood so don't know how often I will be able to stop by, but if I am ever remotely close and need a little java, this is a great little spot.",1
"This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler. The store's staffs are nice, however, their photo lab is miss leading. They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling. 

For the first time user to print photos in the lab, I was charged for $45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without sign-in as member. I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos. I was told ""Too late"" even it's still in one of their store pc for ordering prints. 

Since they are franchise, I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store. I was told ""No"". I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them. 

I will not buy anything from them again.",0
"WOW!!! practically half price on everything compared to the chain stores.  Staff is always very friendly and helpful, and i've literally saved hundreds of dollars since I discovered this store just under a year ago!",1
"Person 1: ""So, where do you want to go to lunch?""

Person 2: ""Hmmm.  I'm not sure""

Person 1: ""Want to go to Paradise?""

Person 2: ""Naaah, we've been there three times recently.""

Person 1: ""What about Subway?""

Person 2: ""I'm so damned tired of sandwiches. . .""

Person 1: ""Well, here's Qdoba.""

Person 2: ""Qdoba?  Okay, I haven't been there in a while.  We can get in and out pretty quickly and get back to work.""

That's pretty much how it is.  Nobody really plans to go out and eat at Qdoba.  It's one of those places you decide to go to on the fly or because you've eaten everywhere else.

The Mexifood is fair.  Nothing special, nothing bad, nothing to distinguish it.  There's tons of Mexican joints within ten miles that are better, but Qdoba's here in this strip mall.  Haven't eaten here in a while and don't want to drive any further?  This will make a nice alternative, and then you'll be good on this place for another six months or so. . .",0
"I didn't have a fully immersed Portland's experience, so perhaps I am selling them a bit short, but as far as my experience went, it was A-OK.

We stopped in because of its proximity to the light rail and our need for alcoholic refreshment.  We had a couple beers (small selection - but we found something we really liked) and a glass of wine (reasonably priced, tasty) The service was fine, the prices fine.  Everything was fine.

And that's just it.  Does 'Fine' merit a 'Yay! I'm a fan', four star review.  No it does not.  Maybe the food is out of this world.  Maybe at night this place lights up and sparkles in a way that the daytime cannot convey.  Its on the light rail, so I may give it another attempt, but on first glance, Portland's is just A-OK.",0
"First off, let me congratulate OHSO on being open for business!  I was thrilled to see another local watering hole open in the neighborhood.  I frequent Arcadia Tavern and JT's often and will most likely add O.H.S.O to the rotation.  Upon entering OHSO, I remember my first impression being ""Is this place really ready to be open for business"".  I noticed a few unfinished details on the building (maybe intentionally) that left me wondering if this place decided to open overnight.

Simple said, I appreciate good service.  There was a lack of this at O.H.S.O.  We were not greeted when we walked in.  There was a group of employees talking at the host stand and I had to approach them before they recognized our group.  They quickly said it was open seating and got back to their converstaion.  We grabbed seats in a booth in the bar area.  We probably sat there for about 5 mins trying to make sense of the various colored menus strewn across the table.  As we were all very thirsty for a cold beer, we decided to finally order at the bar.  Someone eventually came by.

After some of our party left, 2 of us moved up to the bar and asked the bartender a few questions.  No one seemed to know what was going on.  Everyone appeared to be extremely busy with ""busy work"" instead of helping the patrons.  Seemed like a lack of training with the staff.  Overall, I think this place has the potential to be a cool spot and truly hope it does well.  If I could offer a few suggestions, they would be:

1.  Have a dedicated host(s) greet people at the front door.  Take a hint from Arcadia Tavern.  I have never walked in there and not been greeted by a friendly smile.
2.  Get the music in order.  If you want to a progressive/hip local brewery, you are going to have to do better than a ""killers"" album that was popular 4 years ago.
3.  You have something that people want...BEER!  It's great service and attention to detail that will keep patrons coming back.

I look forward to my next visit and I hope some of these kinks are worked out.",0
"Almost as good as the original Boomers.  Wasn't quite there for me but maybe because I was there on a Sunday and the help clearly wasn't into working that day.  Can't say I blame them though.

Anyways, same good menu selections, good prices.  Sliders were tasty but not as good as at the original Boomers.    

Needless to say, I'll be back and try them again.  These guys have awesome Chicago dogs and it would be a shame not to try them here!",1
"I can't think of a better Thai rest. In PHX. Consistently good food and service.  They have Thai staples like rice paper rolls, Tom Ka Gai and Pad Thai as well as more creative items such as Crispy Mango Fish. Average Thai food pricing, free parking.  There are a good number of tables, so don't let a short line dissuade you.  Like any rest., scope your table before you sit to be sure it suits your mood.  Boisterous din in the main room when busy.",1
I had lunch here today with co workers and it was absolutely delicious! Cannot wait to go back gain.,1
"I was here for a conference and saw their sign for a $10 lunch special which wasn't available that day.  Took over an hour to just get a lunch salad.  The waiter had major attitude.
Avoid this place!",0
"We had a GREAT dinner there on Saturday.  We were celebrating my aunt's birthday, and we ordered from the regular and special menus.  I had a truly wonderful chicken Madiera, my hubby had meat loaf, which is always a ""tell"" for a good place, my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy, and my aunt also had the chicken Madiera, which was fork-tender.  We also had great service - attentive without being too much, and we completely enjoyed our meal.  We will definitely visit this location again.",1
"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!",1
"What's all the fuss?  I'm not sure what folks compare this chain too? The Dead Duck Inn?  Joe's local Chinese Gag house? Are those places that great? Sooo fresh and delicious!? Not in my days? Pre-made sitting around and HEAVY oil is what I see from most other establishments. Even those touted by friends. Maybe it's because they know George from behind the counter.  It's not Pei Wei! Pei Wei is a quick, fresh and inexpensive gift from heaven. Even the hard to please Yelper has to admit, the multiple options you have to modify your meal should give you no excuse not to love what you order. The food is fresh and prepared to order. Even fried rice is made to order. The sauces are made from scratch and are a combination of quality Chinese ingredients. (Chili paste, fresh garlic, scallions, bean curd, and a bounty of fresh Chinese vegetables).  Go Yon China will serve you pre-made sauces with no punch and lots of giggle. The atmosphere at Pei Wei is great! Black and dark red with glossy graphics and all sorts of Chinese! Even with the ""stand in line"" style of dining. Makes me hungry just thinkin' about the joint. However, to me it's a take out Ferrari! Call in, swipe my card and off I go. Sure, it's not Chang's. Still, it's better than the local Dead Duck Inn's ""food"" stained art, with a Chinese New Year paper place mat. 

Of course! I'm looking at the healthier options a Chinese food place may have to offer, and Pei Wei lifts the bar in multiple sets! Get your chicken steamed, go brown rice, add extra vegetables or go vegetarian. Still you may complain...""Oh, is it too salty? Or too sweet?"" Give me a break. This is CHINESE FOOD! And, you won't find MSG. So, if you don't want spicy, salty or sweet; have a meal from Bland of the Rising Sun. But, if you want a highly under rated treat...I ask you to open your mind to this familiar spot for clean, fresh, made to order and ""if you like"" healthy Chinese food!",1
"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a Radiohead show and a get away weekend from work.  Got the hotel for the amenities which were great, we played tennis, enjoyed the fantastic people watching at the pool, great cocktails to include the Tequila Sunrise, and some light putt putt outside our cottage.  The room was not ready when we got there so we got a cottage which was supposed to be an upgrade with a semi private patio.  The room was actually very nice and had a great tv which we might have watched for a grand total of 30 minutes in 4 days.  Our room was made up between 4-5 each day that we planned to stay there and then on the day we plan to check out, they came by at 8:30....not sure what the problem was there.  We also had to call about our A/C after we sweated the first night but it was fixed and no problems after that so maybe it was just a glitch which happens.  You are probably wondering what if anything was wrong, the only issue we had was the concierge.....nightmare, no help whatsoever.  Called several times, both girlfriend and I and got the reply on two separate occasions to just check google.  I have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge, this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research.  

All in all, great trip and a nice and above par stay.  I would certainly stay here again if I can get my girl to go with me!",1
"The reviews were so good that my friend and I had to check it out. We were very disappointed this morning while trying to eat breakfast and swatting tons of flies!!! They were everywhere, on us, our food, the other customers - and this was inside.  The egg sandwiches were served on hamburger buns shaped like rolls - I could have went next door to get one just like it at McDonalds.  Not surprised people from Ahwatukee like this place, it looks nice but the food is so-so.",0
"Drunk people go here. Service is good depending who you get. The Burger according to one Arik B can not taste his burger. When ask the server, how come my friend Arik b can't taste his burger? Why?

You had to be there to laugh. What a fun night!!!!

Don't order the pancakes, they are not very good. The chicken strips were a-ok.",0
"I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card.
Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view. 
Complimentary menu is refreshing. Cordial staff. Quiet and relaxed environment.
Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.",1
"Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, put everyones bill on my tab. I opened a tab so this wouldn't happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. Then they over charged us by quit a bit. We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few try's for a water. And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal, just to close a check. Kind of a joke really.",0
"Cute decor-who doesn't like IKEA? Attentive service. We ordered a couple beers and the sweet potato tots. I decided on the Ahi burger and the veggie burger, and my sister went with the two sandwiches: PBnJ and the grilled cheese. Everything was delicious!!!! Unfortunately for us we arrived about 30 min prior to happy hour, but we managed to get a couple beers at the $3 happy hour price. 

I've been here once before and since then it looks like they added a few items to the menu. I'll have to go back to try the shrimp po-boy and the red snapper burger!",1
"Stopped here for lunch with my BFF today.

Nowhere to park, forced to valet, meh...

Love the atmosphere here: classy decor, beautiful patio. Everything on the menu looked delicious. I had a hard time choosing between many foods that I love: crab cakes, goat cheese, crepes... I wanted something lighter so I ordered the oriental chicken salad. In the meantime, our drinks were brought to the table. BFF pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it. The question is: who left it there? Don't know. Gross. This was pointed out to a server (not ours because she had not returned to our table). Our server brought out a new iced tea. She was polite, but not necessarily apologetic. 

When our meal was delivered to the table, BFF pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich (she asked for no tomatoes). The server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate. She came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out. So, I sat with my salad and waited to eat until BFF got her meal (It took a good 5-10 minutes for her new sandwich to come out). 

BFF raved about the dressing on her side salad. My salad was fine, but nothing to rave about (especially not for $13). The ingredients were fresh but the ""shredded chicken"" that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast. To be honest, I prefer shredded chicken which is why I had decided on that particular salad. DISAPPOINTING.

The server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We replied, ""no, thank you"". And she said something like, ""oh, come on, are you sure?"". Again, we declined but I really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch.

The topper? 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their cars=a 10 minute wait just to leave the place. 

I would hesitate to come back, but that menu is just so damn tempting.",0
"Great food.  Good service.
Salsa is the best.  Enchiladas are very good.  I don't know what they put in the sauce, but damn is it good!  No better Mexican food anywhere in Scottsdale.",1
"Mmm dirty hipster bars.  Let me count the ways in which I love you.

You are cheap (we had $2 Stellas)
You are interesting (local art on the walls that I'm told changes regularly)
You are full of pretension (people watching is always worth the price of admission)
You are friendly (like minded souls can smell each other out)

If you are in the Roosevelt district, I highly recommend stopping in for happy hour.  Its cheap and hipstery.  Both words have been used to describe me, so I am naturally predisposed to this place.",1
"My wife called to have our vent cleaned since our dryer was taking over an hour to dry an average load. Our appointment was scheduled for 8 a.m. not for 8-12 as most places. He showed up at 8 and had the vent clean and working well. Excellent customer service and very friendly.
Thanks again,
Gary",1
"Not being a big fan of chain restaurants, I wasnt super excited to eat here last night. I was however, starving and craving mexican food and wanting to try somewhere new so we ended up at Manuel's. 

OMG I loved it! The salsa's (especially the hot!) the chips, the cheese crisp with green chiles and onions, and most of all: the chilaquiles!! I LOVE chilaquiles so much and had mostly seen them only served at breakfast until I opened up Manuel's menu and there they were, just how I like them! SO good I wouldve licked the dish they were served in if I wasnt so full afterwards!

JD had a rolled quesadilla that was fantastic too and we both needed to be rolled out of there when we finished eating. It was so good though that I'm craving it again today. We will definitely be back!",1
This place made me remember why I don't live in Scottsdale anymore.,0
"I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year.  Since then I have been a regular there and the people that co-work or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing start-up culture to Phoenix area.  

The companies that anchor Gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from Gangplank Jr. for kids to learn programming to the Wednesday ""brown bag"" talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using Twitter as a resource for news leads.

Gangplank rocks.  Nuff said.

"I was definitely expressed with their buffet! I had been craving Indian food for quite a while, but since it can be a bit expensive having to order all the dishes separately I was determined to find a place with a lunch buffet nearby to give it a try. I was lucky enough to find this place, which I noticed had fairly good reviews on Yelp. This place is definitely nicer and bigger compared to other Indian buffets I'd been to. It has a wide seating area and nicely arranged tables. The buffet had a great selection and I was able to try new dishes that I'd never tried before. Everything was delicious. Tandoori chicken was dry, but then again I've yet to experience it moist and juicy at a buffet. The garlic Naan bread was soft and warm, SO good! Service was excellent! Server was attentive and polite - my glass of water was never empty. Will definitely be coming back!",1
Excellent cheap Mexican food that tastes as good as any Mexican restaurant.,1
"The chicken was unreal good!  And, the cornbread, just as reviewers stated was heavenly.  It was light and very good!",1
Great martini's and they even have Absynthe if you're looking to get crazy. Great looking modern style bar and lounge.,1
"I had my doubts about Cream Stereo Lounge beacause I didn't like the name of the place and I heard that they played a lot of house and techno music. I've been sick of all the Scottsdale staples like Myst, Axis, SIX, PCL, etc.... so I thought I would give Cream a try and I ended up liking the place a lot. Everyone there was very friendly and the DJ played a lot of good songs to dance to. If you're sick of going to the same bars in Old Town give Cream a try.",1
"I have been to this place a few times over the past few years. I get the same thing, the pollo fundido. It satisfies my Mexican cravings.

The atmosphere is fun, maze like. Service is decent and like most places if something is wrong they are quick to fix it. This is a great local restaurant. I love how it lacks the ultra corporate feel of most main-stream joints. Great Mexican!",1
"We just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at Pita Jungle next door.   It's a self-service yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once you've finished your creation.  

The offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate, but also less traditional offerings like Irish Mint and Red Velvet were also available.  They offer a taste of any of the products, and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container.  They also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation.

I had a combination of the Irish Mint and Latte yogurts, with a couple of toppings.  The yogurt itself was smooth, creamy and well flavored.

We'll likely be dropping by here in the future.",1
"Ok Im giveing Del Taco one more chance....

I go in what is your best chicken Idem....

Have you had the Burrito?

no....I haven't had ethier...

Have any one eaten anything here? I ask the rest of the resturant crew....they All shake there heads no....

ok so even if the food was discounted or free no one should ever eat del taco.....regardless I did eat a burrito.....

and my worst fears where confirmed....I could have dumpster dove at a taco bell and gotten better food......

Feed me bad food once, shame on you.....Feed me bad food 4 times Shame on ME....",0
"One of my earliest memories of Phoenix concerns waking up under the eucalyptus trees that used to cover most of what is now the business park and shopping center next to what I will call the ""new"" Duck. The old one was far larger and would have been about where the Starbucks is now. Of course, I'm talking about 1973 here, so I digress. . . .

Anyway, the current abbreviated Duck remains one of my favorite places to relax and hang out in Phoenix. Now I have a little one who enjoys running through the grass near the patio and socializing with the other youngsters that frequent the place. The bar features interesting wines by the bottle and glass. Most nights the by-the-glass happy hour special is something rather interesting, in contrast to the ""red"" or ""white' found in other joints. The interior of the small bar is dark like a cellar. In fact, you can find a variety of atmospheres in and out of the Duck.

And the sandwiches! Yes, try them all. Very, very good.",1
Had my Snaaz 5k walk for education very beautiful park!!! Clean and would be perfect for walking a dog! There's lots of parking and also there is a desert in downtown Phoenix how nice! Real Arizona feel! I would definitely take my parents or my aunt for a nice walk on a fall morning :),1
"Only three stars?  Wow--maybe it was the ambiance that sucks overall here--I don't know.  I actually didn't go here myself.  It was my wife.  She brought me home a cheese enchilada plate and it hit the spot--even lukewarm.

All I know is that meal was better as a leftover than a lot of the fresh ones I've had at taquerias around the tri city area.  Makes me wonder how it would taste if it were nice and hot. . .

Okay--challenge accepted.  I'll let you know.",1

"I think Matt's has had its '5 minutes of fame'.  Note to owners: Your food is good enough,  your staff is great, so please save your money and move to a better location.  Right now, you're next to a rundown hotel with police baracade tape all over the place.The local residents(?) pan-handling all the waiting customers outside your place. Seriously?   Just sad.  Won't go again, won't recommend it either.  Good luck this summer, the heat will melt all your 'waiting area' customers out .",0
"I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.

I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!",0
"I've traveled to Phoenix several times for business trips and stayed at the Ritz. True Foods was my go to spot in Phoenix because it was right across the street from the hotel. I love this restaurant for the casual vibe and healthy food. My favorite dishes are the Edamame Dumplings and the Miso Glazed Black Cod. It was often hard to get out of work for lunch, so coming to True Foods at the end of the day was always a treat. 

I only wish they had one in San Francisco!",1
"If you work in an office and have to dress business casual, NY & Co is your place to shop. Some of their stuff can be a bit plain but more often then not, they have modest, cute, stylish, business casual clothes at an affordable price. I don't think I have ever been bugged by a salesperson when coming to this store which is actually kinda nice. I can't stand salespeople following me around chiming in about how cute something is (see my review on Coach in LV). Lastly, they have a great display of accent jewelry which is my weakness. Everything is always really different and fun so I can't resist and usually walk out with several pieces. The next time you are trying to find a place to shop, try NY & Co. There is something for everybody   :)",1

"I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me.....",0
"I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.  And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).  Then Crudo disappeared.  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.  Now it has reappeared, and in a better location.  Oh joy.",1
"If you have to travel to Phoenix (Yay!) then chances are you have to travel through Sky Harbor (Boo!). There's also a decent chance you'll consider traveling on Southwest (Boo!) but as airlines (Boo!) in Sky Harbor (Boo!) go, you can do worse than Southwest.

I'm not a huge fan of Southwest, although I'll give credit where credit is due, and that bags fly free thing is genius. Combine one of my least favorite carriers with what is probably my least favorite airport and you've got a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works out in Southwest's benefit. The gates are just as hard to reach for SWest as other carriers, and you're not banished to the edge of the universe for check-in or for baggage claim. They've got a decent presence here, so you may actually find a human who can help should you have a problem.

Yes, they may leave you stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather (check) or force you to dash across the airport with late arriving flights (check) but every once in a while it's a painless operation.",0
"This is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town. It's something different that I think real ""Foodies"" will enjoy. Although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped, it's worth going to over and over again. 

I ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pasty, it was very filling and delicious. Although I had to wait 20 minutes for it, it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty. But if you're ever in a rush, a good thing about this place, is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive.",1
"***** The service was fantastic, There was a nice warm lady attending the shop and the Gelato was awesome as always!!! 
** Yummy Chocolate Caramel Fudge Brownie!! :)",1
"I crave breakfast food all the time, but I want something more than an Ihop or Dennys. Not only is Crackers & Co way better than a mainstream breakfast place, it's actually cheaper too!

I ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and it was amazing. It had just the right amount of spice and the portions were way bigger than I imagined. Their country potatoes are awesome and have nice, brown, crunchy edges. I went with a group of 5 people who all ordered different breakfast items and not a single person was disappointed with their food.

This place was not only really cute but also great for the price and taste. Plus, they serve breakfast all day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
I can't wait to go back.",1
"First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didn't seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didn't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sister's bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldn't recommend to ANYBODY.",0
"Well, if you want California fancy cuisine, this ain't your place.  If you are seeking down-home country cookin, this is your spot.  Anyway, there are no Cracker Barrels in California.  

The lunches for the two of us were great.  Very good service on a busy day.  Our meals were exactly as ordered (many choices at Cracker Barrel) and the food was hot. The prices are unbelievably reasonable, as inexpensive as a fast food restaurant.

The servers are super and extremely courteous and well trained.",1
"I tried to give full marks to Lolo's having heard all the hype. Realize that I am coming from Louisiana and also New York City where one can obtain the namesake specialty rather easily and in variations.
Instead of telling you all the cliche things that you will need to know about Lolo's, I am going to tell you why ultimately I did not ""drink the kool-aid on a  5 star rating.  

Better pricing is the missing star.  I found the place to be on the expensive side for what you get.  It is perhaps a part of my relationship towards this home cooking that makes me feel this way.  But please note:  Service was great...but don't plan on being in and out for a quick lunch unless to do a to go order... Also, these waffles are wonderfully flavored.  I detected a nice hint of vanilla and a touch of cinnamon.  The chicken is nicely seasoned...nothing greasy about this batch.  I will also say that if you are not used to Kool-Aid, or if you are like me and used to be able to water that thing down until the original colour had faded by simply adding batches and batches of sugar to it.... You will be in for a diabetic shock! Here's what to do: Ask for a side glass of water and then inject some of the kool-aid into the water.  My favorite is grape drink!!!  

I am hoping to get back to Lolo's to try their gizzards.  I had the basics on this trip and it is really worth the return trip.  Bring your friends and go and eat late there on Friday night!",1
"Great food, fresh crispy veggies, excellent service. I love the luau pork, but it's kind of salty, even for me considering I love salty food!  Mango iced tea is very refreshing and key lime pie is gooood. I have tried the tofu but it has been hit or miss the way they cook it.I like it crispier (or as crispy as you can get tofu:)",1
"I was pleasantly surprised to find the Phoenix Public Market across the parking deck from the Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. It's too bad it's not located on the ground floor of the school, replacing the space currently occupied by Subway. It would be much healthier for the students.

I had their breakfast protein shake, which was AWESOME! Even though it was $6, I ended up having TWO!

While the shop is not as big as a Whole Foods, it does provide the organic and healthy staples, while serving fresh salads, pastries, and different types of chocolates. I didn't get to purchase the local bran of organic ice cream, which seems to be popular. Maybe next time I'm back in Phoenix.

I also liked their little coffee shop in the back room, which is separate from the main shopping area, giving you a bit of quiet to read a book or check your email.

Lastly, all the staff are quirky, yet incredibly friendly. They offered up suggestions for local things to do, and were generally helpful.

Overall, love this place. I wish it a long and successful life. The world needs more Phoenix Urban Markets.",1
"My sweet tooth was yelling at me! I had to stop in. Four times (to date) and each time I try something different. Other than the cheese curds (which where just ok) each visit was for the frozen custard. 
VERY RICH and CREAMY a little goes a LOOOOONG way. I have tried a small berry sundae, a pineapple malt, and a small black cherry cheesecake concrete mixer. 

The sundae by far has been my favorite. I love the simplicity, the berries were not overly sweet, strangely artificially thickened. 

The malt was nice and malty which I really appreciated and was rather thick even after melting slightly. 

Now the concrete mixer was the richest of the rich. Maybe it was because I decided to go with a cheesecake flavor (to which you can add any other fruit or topping flavor). It was very tart like cream cheese (about as tart as a good Greek yogurt) with small bits of graham crumbs swirled through and of course the blackberry flavor.",0
"This is a fancy fine dining restaurant with a casual feel. The food is definitely under priced. For most of the summer, drinks are cheap and food is half off for the all day happy hour to entice the locals. During the winter, you can't get into this place. It is packed, so reservation is recommend. The food is described as American Southwest. The best three choices to have for the first visit. Is the Famous ""BIG_ASS"" Burger, Green Chile Pork Stew, & Lamb Fondue. These choices will hit the spot and hit the wallet for 10 bucks with tip a person.",1
"I had no idea they were open for lunch! Perfect since the boy and I were down town during lunch the other day. 

We stopped in around 2:30 inthe afternoon. No Wait! I couldn't even believe it. I hadn't eaten there since I was a little girl, but it was just as good as I remember.

We got a couple beers and split the Margarita Pizza. It was sooo yummy! Perfectly crispy on the edges and lots of flavor. The service was a tini bit slow, but no big deal, we loved it. 

If you want great pizza and dont want to wait the normal 3 hours during dinner, you should hit up Pizzaria Bianco while the sun is still up, less wait time if at all. 

Enjoy!!",1
"This is in a really cute part of Chandler.  I've driven by a million times, but never paid attention to the all the restaurants.  We went here for lunch based on the great reviews it received on Yelp.  

I can't really add much more to the other reviews, but just wanted to be one more person to say that the food is delicious & service was excellent.  Great ambiance & music too!",1
"We were in AZ visiting out for Thanksgiving and really wanted so go AZ mexican food but had to go to a place with a full bar for some Margaritas.  This place came up on Yelp and looked interesting so we figured we would give it a try.  The food was pretty good.  My son had a cheese crisp, wife had beef enchiladas and a chicken taco, Mother-in-law had pork tamales, and I had the beef green chile.  They gave us to big baskets of chips and salsa (which we eat too much of!).  Everything was pretty good, but the margaritas were really good.  I always try the house first time I go someplace since I think it is a good judge of how good a place is and theirs did not disappoint.  I think they should advertise them more because they are so good.  Very fresh tasting!  Next time we go back to AZ we will definitely visit again.",1
"Food was decent, not too sure how this place is getting such rave reviews though...

Probably the most expensive Mexican place of it's style. $25 for a burro, two tostadas, and two mini-tacos. Seriously?! Also, no free refills or chips/salsa.

Are we going back? No.",0
"I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation, and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...

The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.",1
"Love this place.  Great staff!  Friendly, fun and knowledgable.  The food is always good.",1
"US Airways used to be right up there w/Continental.. now they're down there

I didn't even mind the fact that they started charging for their food.. 

But now they're going overboard.. 

I didn't want to bring a heavy jacket w/me to Cabo, so I wore a light jacket and I figured the standard blanket they give you during the flight would suffice.  I noticed there weren't any blankets on board and when I asked a flight attendant for one he said "".......yea.. for $7"" I almost started laughing cause I thought he was trying to crack a joke.   He wasn't.  

Introducing US Airways' ""nap pack"" comes w/crappy blanket, ear plugs, inflatable neck rest , for only $7!  Use the money you were previously going to use to purchase your online crappy meal for your standard necessities!  

So I decline.. and they must crank the A/C up ridiculously to tempt you to purchase their stupid nappy pack.. cause the tip of my nose was cold and I just couldn't sleep at all during my flight w hile I was trying cover every surface of my body w/my stretched out light jacket.

And you also suck cause you run out of your purchased meals...who doesn't pack enough for the flight?  You suck at even saving money for yourselves..",0
"I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).  The chicken wings were not that great either.  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.  I will not be going back to this place, so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon.",0
"Let me say this: the bar at Hanny's is one of the best looking bars in Phoenix. This square-shaped sparkly thing gets an A+ on the presentation, and they make some great cocktails. The rest of the place... not so much. I agree with everyone else: Hanny's has a great concept for a place. They left the skeleton of an old department store intact -- complete with a completely unusable second story -- but the results aren't spectacular. The restaurant looks great inside, like it should be a real classy establishment. So why are they serving pizzas here? The pies are decent, yeah, but really? Shouldn't we be getting steak here? Prime rib? A nice grouper fillet perhaps? With such a nice space and a primo location right in the heart of downtown, I'd think Hanny's could step it up in the food department. It's like this place is confused about who it wants to be: a neighborhood fare spot or a classy dining destination.",0
"Went to a party where they had Stacy's cater it. So good-- it was the BBQ beef, BBQ pork and BBQ chicken.  All of them were fantastic but I enjoyed the pork best, which is odd b/c I am not typically a fan of pork.

Anyhow, it was all perfectly moist, well seasoned and was a big hit at the party.  

I would order from them for catering and I need to stop into the actual restaurant sometime to try the other items on the menu.",1
"So as our last restaurant in Phoenix, I decided to visit Green, due to its great reviews and popularly. I got the Kung Po with mock beef, which was only $7, which is super cheap and really good.

The restaurant is hidden in like a little corner, so it's a little hard to find, but the interior is nice and beautiful. As a tip, just remember that you seat yourself and you have to get the menus at the counter. Took us a while to realized that.

Overall, super cheap, really good and nice place.(:",1
"The Harkins Camelview 5 gives Arizonans the unique opportunity to see movies that are normally reserved for screens in NY and CA. Without this theater there would be very little chance to see independent or foreign films in Phoenix. I give a lot of credit to Dan Harkins for keeping this theater open. He certainly can't  make much money at this location. It's financially  impractical to keep such a small theater operating on such prime real estate. This just shows Dan Harkin's commitment to sharing great films with the people of AZ. 

Thanks Dan!",1
"Impossibly good Italian deli in the middle of the desert. Huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread you've ever had outside of NY. As someone who ate here 3 times in a 24 hr period, I feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak. HO-LY-SHIT. Easily the most decadent, flavorful cheesesteak I've had in a VERY long time - and I live 15 minutes outside of Philly. Im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off. Ask for yours on the soft roll.

I should also mention the sausage,  peppers & onion sandwich, which was really good. I suspect they make their own sausage, which elevates them to superstar status in my book. The chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good, and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well.

I dont do cold subs, but the ones I saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty. Perhaps I will try their pizza next time I'm in town.",1
"I order the same thing at every Vietnamese restaurant. Rice Vermicelli Bun with Grilled Pork and Egg Roll, and spring rolls. This order does not change. Ever.

They do the pork here more like a pork patty, or meatloaf if you will. In Vietnamese cuisine, there are two different ways to do it, the other being grilled slices of pork. I don't know which I prefer as they are very very different.

You get a large amount of noodles, very fresh vegetables, and a generous portion of meat. The sauce is tasty, and everything seems very high quality. Spring rolls are good, as is the peanut sauce they serve them with. The service could be worse, but not much. It's pretty horrendous. Atmosphere is typical of a Vietnamese restaurant, total dive.",1
"Baffled by the unfavorable reviews here. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had is the Zinburger. Truffle fries are also delicious. Always have good service here and leave very satisfied. Atmosphere is slightly upscale I suppose, but not snobby as some complain. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and feel right at home here.",1
"Blue Saguaro has been doing the same menu of breakfast sandwiches (seriously delicious - toasted sourdough drenched in salty butter, egg over medium, crispy bacon and melty American but not Kraft cheese) and lunch sandwiches & salads for over 10 years.    There's a reason that it hasn't really changed:  It works. 

The lunch menu has specialty vs regular sandwiches.   Most of the specialty are loaded up with sandwich fixings you're not going to get in a chain shop - cream cheese, sprouts, avocado that wasn't spread on thinner than mustard.   The bread is bakery quality and there's a decent selection.   The ambience is non existent, but when you're grabbing lunch on the run it really doesn't matter.     

They are super fast, but that may be because I always tip a buck.   :)",1
"Luckily, I didn't have to travel far to make my connecting flight. And for this, I thank you, Phoenix.

My brief layover was pleasant as the employees were kind and the flight was on time.  Hopefully, next time I can grace Phoenix with my presence for a little while longer.",1
"Oh, YEAH!!! Coming to Scottsdale. I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale. I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven's Super Quick Service. Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work!!!! Oh, and they talk to you so you can understand, not computer talk. Can't wait for Scottsdale!!!!",1
"My experience was on a random Saturday afternoon, and I think that might skew my opinion a bit.

During my visit we were the only guests dining.  There was one guy at the bar that was friends with the employees.  

The atmosphere is mellow.  And I can imagine it being a pretty happening place on weekend evenings.

The prices were a bit high for what we ate.  I had a pita sandwich and it was just under $10.  The lunch prices are a bit steep.

The food was okay, but nothing I'd go back time and time again for.",0
"I only ask for two things when I'm flying. To land safely. And to not fear planes while on them.

US Airways only delivered on one of those, and I'm still undecided on the first one.
Took a flight late from PHX to SFO. Two hours isn't too bad. Unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives.
I understand that turbulence is normal. But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly, then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives.
Oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive, its probably best that you don't have to overhear the pilots saying ""Wow, that was scary. I'm surprised we landed alright.""
Morons. They should pay for the trauma I'll have for the rest of my life.",0
Obligatory stop for a drink...Dodey is here so that is always good,1
"Friendly staff and clean office.
From what I have seen, somewhat frequent turnover with the Dr.'s I've had.
Right now I have Dr. Susman, she's concise, to the point, compassionate, easy to understand.

Oral surgeon Dr. Lillien does his job well, I got my wisdom teeth out without complications or infections later.
Healed up pretty well.

Scheduled out pretty far so difficult to get an appointment in if you have specific avail abilities.

Certain staff could use more training on procedure and techniques to expedite the process and minimize x-ray radiation time.

Julie is doing a breast cancer walk, so donate (personal check) and get teeth whitening kit for 99 dollars.

About staff:

Kendall is very friendly and professional.
Noreen seems like she could use more training (quite a few x-ray retakes with bite tabs), but she was friendly overall.
The process took a bit longer than I anticipated.

Suggestions:
Train the staff thoroughly, with technique and procedure so it can speed up customer service. especially with bite tab as well as the other kind (the red circular one). Customers like to minimize their radiation exposure time : )

Clean office and helpful reception staff. Dr. Susman was to the point and very clear about wahts going on and what to do next.


downfall:
Scheduling can be somewhat difficult if ppl have specific avail abilities but in general, reception staff is very helpful",0
I love-love-love Green.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the food even better.   The people who work here are lovely sweet and very helpful.   There are far too few vegetarian restaurants in Phoenix metro area and this one gets my full support.,1
"Been there many times with many friends, not fancy food but decent, fresh, local, organic at a good price with none of the pretentions that one would associate with the whole organic/green mocvement in dining. That being said the food only gets 4 stars based on the price plus the 5 star brownies...food is above average but not by much, the atmosphere and price are what i enjoy most",1
Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous!  This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon!,1
"It was nice but not a great experience.  The music was very loud.    The waitress was very helpful and knew the menu and the wines and made some good recommendations (love the Newton Chard).  We split a salad and a pizza.  The watermelon salad was an incredible medley of complex flavors - the red chili giving the watermelon, avocado and goat cheese some kick to offset the sweetness.  Very interesting.  We got the funghi trifolati pizza and it was just ok.  After the first wonderful taste of mushrooms, it was all very bland with nothing to make it stand out.  I think next time I would try sitting on the patio as that looked very inviting and relaxing.",0

"wouldnt you agree that a key part of enjoying the dining experience in part depends upon the company you are dining with?!  having said that, the times i have dined at abuelos have been with my fellow co-workers, all female, and yes, we all get along!  needless to say, we had totally fun & memorable experiences, filled with great conversations, great food and good prices.  their corn chips are fresh and lite, their salsa comes in different levels of heat.  i usually request the hot salsa.  i'm partial to their chicken enchilada.  portions are just right, one is plenty for me, usually served with rice.  in all fairness, believe i need to sample other dishes, before i could rate it any higher.  found another great restaurant in chandler, az!  top3 reasons why...1- great tasting dish 2- good value  3- atmosphere (location, service, ambience)",1
"We were staying at a local hotel and used online ordering to feed our crew.  The ordering went smoothly and the pleasant surprise was the food arrived early and warm.  We ordered two of their usual pizzas and one of our custom orders.  Could have had a few more toppings on one of them, but overall nice value and timely service with warm food.  We looked for the specials on-line and save a few dollars.  Worth the time to do so.  Would order again.",1
"Service is good... The newer waitors tend to forget you're there. Food is delicious, never gotten food poisoning... Cheesecake is magnificent... The best kind is the Godiva, expensive bit worth it!",1
"Recently a friend at the gallery was very excited because it was Dollar taco night a Chicos.  That is fine if you have any idea of where it is.  Turns out I had been by there more then a few times when I went to the Safeway and Subway at 7th st and McDowell.  It's a little place in a very small strip center.  It's very much a neighborhood
place,  clean with an upbeat atmosphere and a few tables outside.  That's about all I can say about the setting.

I was surprised by the variety of meats that one can get on the tacos.  The tacos aren't  to exciting but on the whole are fresh and have a good flavor better than I would have expected.  That is all I had but from what I saw of the meals around me, hey looked pretty good as a whole.

I will go back to Chico's.  It definitely has fare that is better than the local fast food in the same price range.  Not an exciting place but pleasant to think of returning to.  I went there after a very long day so that is saying something.  Just the enjoyment of quite of the few people just sitting down and having a good time rubbed of on me.  I needed it!",1
"I was also roped in with a flier on my door, and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies, salad, and drink with a pizza order.  Upon delivery, I was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread, no purchase necessary.  Needless to say, this has become a go-to pizza option for me.  4 stars for food taste and quality, an extra for great service and good deals.
Salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza, pizza is particularly good, cookies are awesome, cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese.  Their sauce is really tasty- tastes fresh and not too sweet.  Delivery is free, and on time.  The longest time I've been quoted for a pizza (at 7:00 on a Saturday) was 45 minutes, and they got there in 23 minutes (I wasn't timing them but I did notice how quick they got there).  They have a hot'n'ready special that's only a dollar more than Little Sleazer's and ten times better.  And if you don't think it's good, you get your money back.  So really, you should just try it.  Okay?  Okay.",1
"This is the very first time I have ever been in here.This location anyway, the first one was in downtown Seattle. 
 Yes, I came with my girlfriend. Both times,but it is a cool place for men as well.
Samples of colonge, creams ,lotions and anything else you have ever wanted to try. 
They will even give you samples of things to take home. They will make you a sample of anything you would like to try.
It can be challange to get inside the Scottsdale Mall at times.
But, on this day it was not too bad,(during the week) and early in the day.
It is a cool place,with lots to see and try. Loads of people wanting to help you as well.",1
"Just came from there as part of my trip down the Apache Trail. My 9year old daughter loved it so much she insisted on stopping in again on the way back. The town is really cute with tons of photo ops. We picked up a few fun souveniers and some prickly pear fudge. We did this in 100 degree temps and still enjoyed it. For those curmudgeons moaning about this being a tourist trap, RELAX....the kids love it. This 40 something mom loved it. It's free to just walk around.  But definitely do the Mystery Shack. Weird and fun. I actually got dizzy in it.",1
"We live in the neighborhood so were excited to see a new place with a huge range of beers open up.

The decorations are a bit sparse, but we like to sit on the patio or the conversation areas near the bar, which are perfect this time of year. Yucca chips are personal favorites, as is the gnocchi bolognese. Burger wasn't bad, but a burger is just a burger. They're still adjusting their menu it seems, which I expect any place to do for the first few weeks as they settle in.

I really love their commitment to craft beer, especially Arizona beers. $5 pitchers of AZ beer before 5:00 is not only quite a tasty offering, but appeals to my love of all things local.

Give OHSO a try!",1

Good line up of the same old shops... spencers, petpad, sears, macys, kitchen store, but also the addition of dicks sporting goods and forever 21. 

They have a good food court, starbucks, movie theater and a chevy's!!!

This was also the site of the sniper hijack of an armored car  November 28, 1994 as seen on City Confindetial. Was a great episode, worth watching.  But its not an unsafe mall like some of the malls west of I17.",1

Oh yah, the Pine Steak, is also fantastic and will probably also cause addictive like tendencies. 

Oh, oh, oh...  the chicken and waffles are also a pleasant surprise in the other wise repetitive and ordinary dining scene that is so often found in Phoenix. 

Just do yourself a favor and go check this place out. And try the home made ginger ale, tonic or lemonade by them selves... or mix it up with one of their top shelve spirits.",1
"Coming into the Phoenix area for a family party, we stopped off at Los Sombreros for some margaritas and Mexican on an otherwise cooler night in the valley of the sun. 

I was told they are very picky about reservations and, if your party isn't complete, no table. So our 6pm reservation was now in jeopardy because the last two of us (me and my fiance) were running late due to issues on the ramp at Sky Harbor airport, obviously out of our control. But they still didn't want to seat us...  additionally, I overhead on the way to the place that they would only ""try"" to do their best to accommodate our party, making it sound like they were booked up solid until closing....typical Scottsdale always trying to look more happening and hot than it really is. 

Moving on, we somehow ""lucked out"" (go figure) and had a table no problem, so all the stress caused by the hostess was unnecessary and, in my opinion, pretty unprofessional, especially since the restaurant was empty by 8pm, again, typical Scottsdale. 

The menu was brief, and I almost had to double check I wasn't looking at an appetizer. Most of the items are typical Mexican staples with a bit of a Southwestern American twist to them making the food a hit or miss if you ask me, some items were good, some were not. But that's really anywhere I suppose. 

The one thing that stood out for me was the Guac. I will say this was flat out delicious but Guac is pretty had to screw up. 

The margaritas in my opinion reminded me of something you'd get more at Chilis, a little too sweet for my liking but definitely drinkable. 

The fundidto appetizer we ordered left the table empty twice and well I'm not really one to combine seafood and cheese, this blend seemed to have a harmony with others and I'd recommend it to a first timer, +1 if you request to add spinach. 

Finally moving on to the entrees, different contraptions from the kitchen filled our table with vibrant colors, assortments and sizes. 

I myself ordered what I was told is sort of the house specialty ,call it carnitas mixed in a chipotle sauce with veggies type of deal. While it was tasteful and was more than enough to get the job done for me, the flavor of the pork wasn't really there, at, all. 

I browsed over a couple other reviews and noted the same complaint but hey that's what hot sauce is for I guess. 

Overall it's an alternative to the chains hoarding Scottsdale road.",0
"I don't know what's up with Eddie??? I always found him to be pleasant, and really taking care of the customers. However on the 17th of November we had a birthday party of 19 people, and they gave us one waitress. We sat down at 7:00 pm and our main course came at 9:15. No real big deal but one person can't handle a table of 19, and we were having fun. So one of the guest's had ordered the $12.00 burger along with a salad and told the waitress no Mayo because he can't stand it at all. The burger comes out and it has Mayo on it, and he tells the waitress. She was not at fault, and had written it down clearly. He asked for a new one, and she comes back and say's Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun. He didn't want that because he hates Mayo that much, so there was no problem taking it off the tab, but Eddie would not make a new one. LOL. What's up Eddie??? I don't understand at all, you take it off the bill because you screwed up, but refuse to make another burger that you would have been paid for.  Then you end up looking like a fool in front of the other eighteen people. My daughter has even taken one of your classes, and said what a great guy you are. Really, Really bad PR that night and the next birthday party wont be at Eddie's House. Great time that night, but the ending leaves a very bad taste in 19 people's mouth.",0
"I'm not a huge sushi person (I know, I know...) but I ordered the tuna with lotus chips and it was very yummy. The server was friendly and the chefs were efficient. The atmosphere is dark and modern though a bit squashed and overwhelming.",0
"After hearing a lot about all of the MBFGR's that are around the valley, I finally got a chance to go recently as part of a family gathering (which was a planning fiasco and logistical nightmare, but I digress).  This location was, well, let's just say, it wasn't crowded.  And it showed in the service, very nice and attentive.  They were very patient when our party was supposed to be 8 people, then ballooned to 12 people, then 13.  Unfortunately, one of the solutions to accommodate us was to put a couple of square tables 'attached' to our eight person round table.  I *hate* this.  It's just awkward for at least half the people, and then the people that get stuck at the 'junction'...sucks...

We ordered some apps, though the only one I tried was the saganaki.  It was definitely good and the pita bread that it came with was nice and warm.  For a meal, I ordered a gyro pita.  Now, I understand that this is a 'full' greek restaurant, and maybe I shouldn't have gone with a gyro, BUT, that's what I was in the mood for, and being a basic greek food, shouldn't be hard to make a good one right?  Well, apparently not.  I've probably gotten gyros at ten places around town, and this was definitely the worst one I've had.  The pita wasn't particularly warm and the meat was kind of tough.  The tzatziki was fine, but thought it was a little weird to be on the side.

The service was good and patient, but the lame decision to combine two different kind of tables (when we suggested moving and pushing several squares together) knocks them down a little bit.  Though not as much as the not good gyro.  Probably closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2.",0
"I have been attending Az Combat for the past 9 years and the instructors are fantastic. They teach Kickboxing, Jui-jitsu and MMA classes. Az Combat was one of the very first MMA Gyms in Arizona and have a great reputation as one of the top 10 training gyms in the nation. My daughter has also been at this school for the same amount of time and has taken advantage of many of the classes they offer including their boot camp. I would highly recommend this gym for beginners and the advanced  looking to break into the MMA circle. They have produced some of the top named fighters in Arizona.",1
"I hate to give this place 1 star but my recent experiences were horrible. I use to dine at this restaurant often with my family. The more we go, service decreased. Our water cups never get filled.

The very last time I was there, I found a gnat in my pho. Although I have eaten about 50% of the medicore pho, they asked if I wanted another bowl. I said no; I was there on my lunch break. No time to wait for another bowl. I got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise, there was no discount or any sort of accommodation. 

I am disappointed with them and will not be back.",0
"I ordered the Peanut Panang Chicken.... I rqstd to the waitress that I wanted extra Bell Pepper. When it came, it had -NO- Bell Peppers at all.... i actually didn't realize this until about 5 mins into eating it. could not find our waitress, I waited about 7 mins, finally, I had to get up & search for her. I found another waiter & told him my problem. He took my Dish, but then came back to tell me that they are ""All out of Green Bell Peppers. Would I like Red Bell Peppers"". I said yes, of course.  This whole experience has put a sour taste in my mouth about this place, which is next door to the 'mediocre' Good Egg on Central.   I like Wild Thaiger on Central MUCH better instead!",0
"Since this was a little local spot I always passed, I decided to give it a try one day. The décor is so beyond needing an update, it needs a complete makeover. If you had Mr. Ramsey visit, he would say, ""Oh God...what were you thinking"". The location is great and I think that the restaurant has potential to do better than it is. The prices were about average in comparison to other breakfast restaurants in the area and the menu had a wide selection of breakfast goodies. The food was extremely average...I would have to compare it to the quality and creativity of Denny's. Nothing special, and for $30.00 for breakfast for two...I would not go back. There are so many great restaurants in the area and I like to support local business but this place just needs to start from scratch to make it great.",0
"ZERO stars!
I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;
One, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!
On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me ""a very inhumane person"" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).
Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.
I have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!",0
"For quick fast food.. this is my choice.. I usually call ahead and get take out.. Dont expect super friendly.. but its just take out.. not clear table service.. even if you stay.. I always get the chicken salad with sesame vinagrette on the side but I will say, Im not a fan of the pungent dressing.. I get the chile sauce instead.. vietnamese rolls.. and its not so unhealthy.. NOW my friends that usually nosh with me.. hate the foods they get.. they say it every time I suggest this place.. who knows? Since I  havent really tried anything from my norm salad.. I cant say.. but for me its a strong 3..",0
"I have been to the Freddy's location in Gilbert several times and really enjoyed it so when I saw a Freddy's had opened in my ""hood"" I was excited.  My daughter and I went over for some dessert and they did not dissappoint!  The custard was smooth and creamy with lots of toppings to choose from.  I have not tried the burgers at this location yet but if they are anything like the other location they will be very tasty.  And don't forget to try the shoestring fries.  I usually like thicker fries but these are nice and crispy and delicious!  I'm so glad Freddy's took over this location.",1
Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.  Wish there were some in LA.  Man taste so good and flavor.,1
"This place was the worst place to EVER live! I lived here from Aug 2010 to may 2011, i was always in the office see when the grates would be fixed?? the office always gave me the run around very rude. You would think after the gun shoots, assaults, and car break ins that they would fix the gates but nope and to this day they still aren't fixed. When we moved in they said they would be fixed in a week and they lied.  Also the gym is huge but NONE of the equipment works! living here was SO gross! nothing worked our neighbors are Mexican thugs doing drug cat calling at anything that walks it was gross. I hated living here! 

 But the worst part was a few weeks ago we get a call from collections saying we owe Scottsdale Springs $300 bucks over 10 months after moving out! I called them up like wtf, and they were SO rude said too bad pay it or your credit score will hurt, we even gave a fowarding address and we NEVER got a letter in the mail about any damages. They claim we never gave them a forwarding address which is bull. 

I really hope people read these reviews i would hate to see anyone else scammed by this god awful company!",0
"I've swung into Echo a few times and haven't ever had a bad cup of coffee. The cappuccino is pretty solid and the zucchini bread I had for breakfast one day was a win. If I recall correctly it came in a cute little box too.

For some reason I've never been able to feel relaxed and at home enough to chill and enjoy an afternoon or evening there. Not sure why, but just haven't.",0
Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time.,1
"The hole in the rock was pretty interesting, but only for about 5 minutes. It's not a hike at all, more of a walk on unpaved ground. Once you're up there, the view is pretty cool, but the crowds of people and rowdy kids and dogs detract from the magnificence and romance. I'd think it's a great place to take kids, though, because of how easy it is. Good thing it's located in Papago Park so you can go and see the zoo or the gardens or Hunt's Tomb while you're there. If you go just to see the hole, it's kind of a waste of time.",0
Love the wings!,1
Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night. You will not be disappointed. The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing.,1
This place is over priced and the service is horrible. I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading!,0
"Changing Hands is the perfect bookstore. These types of places just don't seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive.

Allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I don't go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here.

First, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isn't always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. What's notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat.

Second, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joe's, Mac's, Jamba Juice--you can't go wrong.

Third, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once you're in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff ""who wrote such and such?"". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  ""who wrote such and such"". If he doesn't know, someone else will  probably pipe up. It's this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere.

The only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. There's a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joe's, and book reading demographic, so I can't blame them for meeting the inherent demand.",1
"Very Clean store. But I guess when you're paying about 300% more than you would anywhere else, the place can afford it. The people in the front are pretty friendly. There is a lady in the deli, she is pretty friendly/talkative. There are people who mill around the store wearing name tags, they are not friendly or polite.

I just cannot get over how expensive safeway is.",0
"I've been to a few Schlotzky's around the valley and this one is actually surprisingly one of the nicer ones.  It's clean with plenty of space for even the largest working group lunch.  Service comes quick, and they have this southwestern sandwich that is great!

If you're one of the many people who work for a large company on the Dunlap corporate freeway, this is not a bad place to grab a bite before the second half of your work day.

One quick tip - it's kind of tough to find, but it's a stone's throw north of Dunlap on the frontage rd.  You have to go back and around a building to find it though.",1
"Tried this place for the first time tonight, and was impressed with absolutely everything. Well-lit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area. I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it. Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries, along with one of the best slices of toast I've ever had. All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home, which almost never happens with fast food. I wish I had gotten the girl's name who took care of me. She was cute as a button- very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions. I'll be back here soon!",1
LOVE the food!!!!,1
It's okay. it's nothing like San Francisco food .,0

To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!

I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work. Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it. While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)

During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right. It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way! 

Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness. Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too. Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.

This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 45 minutes. Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food. Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's. 

This is your Downtown business Yelpers, it's time to kick off those business casuals, and make Friday lunch your own!",1
"Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.",1
"HELLLLLLLLO GOLFERS!   What a sexy course this is.   This ranks up there with some of the best courses I've ever played, and THE BEST desert course I have ever played!    Yes it's desert links style golf, but you're in the desert so what do you expect?  It's kind of a trek, but it'll be worth it.   From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you'll enjoy the service and scenery.  A real private club feel.

As mentioned earlier this is DESERT LINKS GOLF!   No adjoining fairways, and all the crap plays as PGA desert (lateral).   The fairways are pretty wide for the most part, so you can spray the ball a bit, but there is definitely some carry involved on some of the tee boxes.  Hole 18 is a very hard core par 4.   Long carry on the approach to the green with a TON of water along the right side of the fairway and green.   This is the kind of hole that can ruin a good day on the course real quick.   Don't be afraid to lay up.  :)    Oh, and there are mens ratings for ALL the tee boxes, I'd recommend higher handicappers play from the forward tees, because this course could be really hard if you're a mediocre golfer... 

Maintenance was perfect, even in September after baking in the Arizona heat all summer.   The fairways were well manicured, and not too hard.  Nice rough, but not too tall.   A slightly errant shot will be caught, but you won't have to worry about searching for your ball for 5 minutes either.   The greens were also perfect.   Nice and fast, and TRUE!

Ok, I'm done gushing about this course...   Give it a shot, you won't regret it.",1
Tim is really a very friendly and honest guy. He will tell you what you need or what can wait. This place is worth going to! It will save you tons of money!,1
I have liked every sub I've had there with the exception of one. Pretty good odds!,1
"After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60's, my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro. We had a perfect meal there. Amazing ambiance, twinkly lights in the courtyard, live musician. Great wine. Food was so unique and delicious- I'd describe it as Southern-Spanish fusion. This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix. 

If you live in Phoenix, you have no excuse to not come here. I live in Chicago and I'm sure I'll be back.",1
"I'd leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons (and yes there are additional exceptions)

1. Nobuo at Teeter House.
2. Fez.
3. My friends in various parts of the valley

and 

4. Mekong Supermarket.

I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, I'll eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate.

Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar. 

This place has it all.

I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood. Want a live crab? Boom. Done. Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap? It's yours.

To me, there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want. 

Make the trek. You won't regret it.",1
"Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware...",0
"My sister took me here last week its crazy that I haven't been yet right? This is her regular go to place. Not much I can say after so many reviews here already. The patio looked very nice I bet its the place to be when its cooler. It was kind of empty in here but it was late afternoon. My sis ordered us some Drunken Italian Sodas they were made super strong though usually this would not detour me however I had my child with me and had to drive all the way back home after. Basically it tasted like straight vodka in a giant glass it was a bit much for me mid day and after adding Sprite to it which I stole from my daughter I still couldn't drink it without feeling like I'd be a drunken Mexican after. I didn't understand this drink maybe someone can explain it to me? My sis told me their Sangria was good but I had no idea they made Caipirinha's next time that's what I get no question.
 The food: We had the garlic lemon hummus it was really good the ingredients separately didn't have much taste to them but together it was really nice the pita bread was excellent. The kid couldn't stop eating the hummus she got so full she barely touched her mac n cheese so we brought that home along w all the leftover hummus. Now on to the Tejano burger we decided to split. OMG it was so delicous I couldn't put it down and we both regretted having split it w each other. Extra star just for that burger alone you best try it if you haven't son!!!",1
"Still a great place to eat. A little further from Los Tacos in AJ (home for me) since Los Tacos closed, i frequent here more often..

It is good.. I want to add that their green corn tamales are GREAT!  

their Green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on YELP's reviews. I like it a lot too!

I plan to order more tamales for the holidays! hurrah!",1
"Food was amazing but the service was horrible! I would suggest to take out don't dine in. I ordered the eggs Benedict, instead of Canadian bacon, they put crispy bacon on it served it with hash browns and a salad with a balsamic vinegarette. 

The two girl working there were so unprofessional from their interaction to the attire.",0

Just go to in-and-out Burger if you don't want to feel gross and poor.",0

"After talking to a number of bartenders in the area -- and doing some fairly extensive personal research -- I feel pretty comfortable saying that if you want the best cocktails in the Phoenix area, you should head to the Jade Bar at the Sanctuary Resort.  

This is off the beaten path a bit, and after a few miles down streets with no street lights, it felt a bit like driving to a ski lodge up in the mountains.  It's worth the drive though.  I had two excellent cocktails (""The Last Word"" and a ""Pendemums Club""), and one enjoyable and informative conversation with Jillian the bartender.  Wish I could have made some of their mixology classes.",1
Very typical mexican food. nothing special.,0
"Normally have had great service & food here, but on Father's Day, Nicole H was simply horrible.  Rude, slow, non-helpful, etc.  Just a total fail.  

A different food-deliverer brought out food and ""auctioned it off"" (didn't know who got what), and I asked for a refill on my empty water glass, but he didn't bring it after 15 minutes, and Nicole didn't notice, so I had to bring it up to her.

Their bloody Mary's taste just like tomato juice with tobasco.  Nothing special at all.  And for $12???!?!?!??!?!  SHAME.

The coq au vin was great.

WHY IS THERE NO ""CONTACT US""/e-mail address ON THEIR WEBSITE?????",0
"This is a real find and I mean ""find""  because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown Glendale. This small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine, not many polish restaurants around.  The food is flavorful and fresh, the soups are unique and tasty.  The stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew.The owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing.  

My only disappointment is the limited hours, I work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week.  Definitely worth the trip.",1
"I Live close but will stop eating there. The service was slow, my friend complanned about a order he had and they said ow next time tell them to make it different for you?  Really then I ordered another simple California roll Took forever.  The Sushi is allright but the overall experience is worth driving somewhere else you lost me...",0
"Spinato's has great red sauce for the pasta but I prefer a more earthy pizza. High School kids love it though. 
This restaurant was a Chili's before, but they have remodeled and did a fabulous job. The take out door is discrete and the bar area is large and comfortable. 
Food portions are quite big and they have a nice selection on the menu.",0
"Dropping down to three stars ... On a recent visit, I saw TWO roaches on the main floor of the restaurant. No one seemed to care, so I got up and stepped on one.  I pointed out the other, and one of the staff killed it, but they didn't seem surprised.  I know that roaches are hard to control, but having two of them wandering about in a busy restaurant just isn't a good thing. 

Also, our waiter was an overly chatty guy who seems to think we are interested in his voice.  They had some good staff in the past, but I suspect the owner, who likes to get drunk and hang out on the patio, gives me the impression of a guy who would be difficult to work for! 

The food is still decent and better than anything else I've found, but I'm looking for alternatives ...",0
"I work next door, and I love her ! She has done an excellent job of slim fitting my baggy shirts !! 

Well she did ask me if I was gay but then hey, given how animated I get about clothes I dont blame her for askin ! My SO found this rather amusing and laughed her head off... oh well getting back to my review. 

I love nadya cuz she does a wonderful job, each time. She knows when the darts will give the slimming effect and when the sides are to be taken in. Its never too tight and never too lose, and she always always delivers on time.  

I have been here atleast 10 times !! Trust me my metrosexuality wouldnt let me let me go back if it wasnt a five star service!!",1
"Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place?  Well, they got rid of long time Triva host, Dave (who had been featured in the College Times and was the best thing about the trivia).  Without Dave's personality, this place just doesn't cut it.  Will never go here again. Bummer.",0

P.S. snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll!",0
"Oz is a great local bar and a nice change from the bumping Charlie's (which, don't get me wrong, is still a good bar). Booker, the bartender, is the coolest and will bring you any of the toys on the back counter, so long as he has time. The cheap prices, awesome juke box (sorry Korina, we were probably the ones playing all the Madonna) and a chance of spotting Stephanie Ann--the most fabulous drag queen around who really knows her vodka--are but a few of the reasons why I  love this place. It's also walking distance from my BFF's house.",1
I'm a big fan of their strawberry water and if I'm looking for a better lunch than what I have at home I'll swing by and pick up a salad from here.  They have a good selection- and it's constantly expanding.,1
"I love this place, sure its kinda creepy and in the middle of an odd office complex but DAMN those donut holes chocolate cake not the glazed ones are good!  Not to mention the NINJA BOWLS!!  Good God get the Sizzling ninja, top that off with a fried egg, and pineapple, get healthy with some brown rice and white chicken and then DRENCH that bowl with NINJA SAUCE AND SRIRACHA (which comes standard btw) AMAZING! Don't waste your life away without having one of these ninja bowls at this donut shop, i never thought i would be able to say that statement with a straight face but i did!  And for those wondering they don't serve pirates (some will understand this fact)  Also if you come back a few times they might throw some free donut holes at YOUR FACE LIKE NINJA STARS!!  I joke they don't throw them but you may get some for free (really though)!",1
"I'm married to a Japanese and work for Japanese company. I've been to Japan I don't know how many times and have eaten well there. This is simply top class, I'd even say special. The style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure Japanese to Japanese with some very tasteful western inflections. I'm not in Phoenix often. But this will be on my list every time I go if I have anything to say about it.",1
"Overall this place isn't so bad for a quick mexican food place. It's not like eating at a restaurant or anything like that. The food portions are pretty great and sold at a fair price. I really liked their salsa and I felt it was nice and flavorful. I'd say this place is a small step up from Filbertos.

The staff here, however, were really rude. They seemed to want to rush everyone around.",0
"I rather go to Native or Zipps... We have had bad expierence after bad expierence here. If you are craving wings, this isn't the spot for you.",0
What can I say I love AJs especially the Boulangerie or coffee bar.  Jason is the best.   The pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is deli-sh with a yummy cheese croissant.  I admit I usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store.  Oh and if you go check out the display/decorations they are usually pretty cool.,1
"Missed the happy hour but  the Margaritas were not expensive. Waited for an outside table but had to wait inside because you are not permitted to wait outside with a drink in hand. .( As an aside saw 2 arrests on Mill Ave after dinner becuse 2 guysgot caught drinking beer not so carefully disguised in brown bags.) Well worth it on a beautiful night.Great for people watching. Yes, cornbread is good but the nachos with 3 types of salsa was better. My entree was a chicken, mushroom artichoke stack. Decent but not fabulous. My wife's mushroom enchillada was better. .",0
"This is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martini's they serve here. We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:

Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.

Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small
in seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.

Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.

recommended Food:
Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus.
Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss
meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty.
Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended.
Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few.
Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.
Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.


Pricing is on par with Sophie's but less than Christopher's and more that Ticoz. I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it.",1
"I'm from Chicago so I'm picky with my pizza--this place does it right (NY style)! I love the ""hole in the wall"" feel. Every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign. I ordered the Mozzarella sticks and a large Monster Pie (Sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onion and cheese). The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection. They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome. The pizza was unbelievable--I think the crumbled sausage really did it! They have great deals like large pie & 20 wings for $20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday. Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular!",1
"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  The service was excellent and the view of Pheonix at sunset was nice.  I ate the wedge salad (nothing special) and the chorizo mac and cheese (yummy).  The highlight for me was the pudding trio, the honey date flan was delicious but the portion was small...which led me to savor every bite.  The other people in my party were satisfied with their food and there were no complaints.",0
Great food and drink. The traditional margaritas are the best. Sara was our server and she was very knowledgable about the menu and was quite entertaining. The cheese enchilada that I had was one of the best ever.,1
"I've eatin' a lot of pizza and can say without worries that Mama Mia's is the Best I've had -- Consistency, value and great service sets them apart -- They also have the best take out wings in town!!!!",1
"I love SAIL INN! Getting past the $8-10 cover on weekends is the hard part, but usually Sail delivers, 1) AMAZING LOCAL BANDS, 2) Laid back hippie, hipster,arty, folk vibe 2) cheap drinks, LOVE the little pitchers of beer - budlite for $4.25 on certain nights. Phoenix has a pretty lame music scene, but at least at Sail Inn you can always find decent live music and a fun crowd.",1
"The Culinary Dropout , you get the best of both worlds. The food is off the hook (it's great) ,the service, these ladie's and guy's take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike",1
"Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations.",1
"So I am not usually in the Tempe area, but a friend told me about this place. So I though I would go try it out. I got a Grande Latte that was around $4. Not a bad price. But what made it worth it was that I guess this Friday I went was a Free Shot Friday. So I got an extra Espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for $4 bucks...no that is a deal. Not sure if they always have the promotion on Fridays. But it sure did make my morning a little better.

Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made.

The had a ton of great looking pastries even though I didn't sample any. Cakes, Eclairs, Scones, and I think even what looked like cheesecake. 

The decor was very interesting. An old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe. I think they have Wifi too. I saw a few people on there computers.

The service was a little slow I think. Felt like I was waiting for my drink for 10 minutes and the place was not really that busy. This was probably because of the guy ahead of me when I walked in who had about 7 different modifications to his drink. I have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying. So I will let them slide on the time of service.

Overall a great experience. Would have been 3 stars, but when you get something for free, in my book that is an automatically another star.",1
"Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

Pros
* Good food
* Originality
* Portions
* Customer service
* Coat hooks at the bar

Cons
* Small interior",1
"There's a special little place in my heart designated specifically for JoBot, so I'm thrilled to be the 100th person to get to sing the praises of this adorable little coffee shop/creperie/hole-in-the-wall bundle of amazing-ness.

I came across JoBot by accident about a year ago while looking for a late night wi-fi spot to do some studying. It fit the bill perfectly, minus the fact that it was extremely difficult to concentrate with the loud music coming from the Lost Leaf, the interesting conversations that I couldn't help from overhearing, and the endless amount of scrumptious plates that kept parading past me. 

That said, I've made several ""study"" trips to JoBot since. While I may not be as productive as I would be at some of those quieter little coffee shops where everyone has their nose in a book or a laptop, I find that I always walk away a very happy camper, every time. 

Their crepes/tacos are delicious. All of them. Sometimes I feel as though the crepes are slightly undercooked, but once I dig inside to discover the tantalizing flavors that lie within, I tend to forget all about that. The root beer pork remains one of my faves followed by a strawberry/banana concoction for dessert. Yum, yum, yum.

Go here if you want good coffee (the bumble bee is tasty), good eats, good conversation, good atmosphere, good prices, good entertainment, and free wi-fi at any and all hours (they don't seem to close on weekends). And if you're really feeling frisky head down a house or two for some NachoBot. Gosh I love this place.",1
"Great Thanksgiving meal. I had a similar meal at Busters on the Lake for cheaper last year but that doesn't take away from the good spinach and sweet potatoes. Good service, good bread, good view...",1
"I have had the opportunity to watch games at the Staples Center, and Honda Center in Los Angeles and Anaheim. Both are great arenas and are very fan friendly. Jobing.com is totally different, and that's not a bad thing! I really enjoy the arena is in the same complex with restaurants and movie theater. Great place to hang out before and after the game. Parking is great, I actually had a parking pass and did not use it. I just parked at the west gate parking lot. The arena was very easy to acess, and we had a great time. We will be coming back many more times.",1
"Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo. This store has everything! The employees are also very knowledgeable. The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I don't like change). So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec. The Malbec tasted amazing! I was so happy. For those of you who don't know, it's not only wine! You can find everything else. Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests. Also, don't forget to chill your bottles before you leave!",1
"So, clearly the musician's make the night.  Our night was not so hot.   Half of the bad that we caught wasn't worthy of stage time, the other half was.  The horn players were exceptional, the Keyboardist wasn't.  I'll stick to the facility.  The Rhythm Room is a Phoenix, classic on the music scene, or so I'm told.  This was evident when Paul Reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage.  That was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place.  Beyond that, I'm can't really claim that this place is worth the time.  We'll have to try it again to confirm, yet my urge to do so isn't high right now.  The neighborhood is questionable.  The entrance is not obvious, the bar and the service are not inviting.  The music area of the building is excellent.  You sit very close to the band.  The one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup/teardown between bands.  We waited for an hour between bands.  The Rhythm Room is missing an opportunity here, they need a comedian or something the fill the gap.  

Some fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements.  Just because it's a known classic doesn't mean that it can't change for the better.  The one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they're getting good bands, then it makes for a great night.  The annoyances only become obvious when you have an hour to descern them between bands.

The musician's interaction with the crowd before and after shows is really cool.  This makes everyone involved feel like they're in the scene.",0
"I'm still a big fan of the light rail! Sure, I can't use it every day, but it's about the only thing that will get me to head to downtown for a night out.  

It's perfect for pub crawls, you can gather a huge group, keep everyone more or less together, and make frequent stops.  The extended hours mean more time for drinking!

The trains have stayed clean, they run when they are supposed to, and I've never had a problem.  The people watching is awesome as well.  Each stop is a mystery grab bag of the teeming masses of people here in town. 

I just wish it had a wider range, I'd use it every day if I could.",1
"I had eaten breakfast twice at the Chandler Chompies and loved it so I wanted my husband to try them.  However, we went to the Tempe location instead.  Much older restaurant (pretty worn) and it took some time for me not to be grossed out by the nasty overall smell of the place.  My breakfast wasn't half as good this time and my husband didn't like his either - just boring and not repeatable.  Hoping he'll give me another shot and we'll make the drive out to Chandler next time.",0
"Food: great!  Service: Excellent!  I had the Frank Sinatra Calzone (you choose 3 items for the filling...I suggest what I had: sausage, pepperoni, and meatball).  It was just like being back in New York.  Loaded with Ricotta, too...They don't skimp here.  The server was great too...Didn't catch his name, but he's a burly, bald headed guy with a beard.  Very friendly, polite, attentive.  Cool to look in the kitchen and see the pizzas being hand tossed...Wonder if the cook thinks I was looking at him...Well, I actually was, but only because he really got into tossing the pizzas and was entertaining to watch.

Go there.  Eat everything.  Tip big!",1
"The Vig Uptown has its hits and misses, but the hits definitely outnumber the misses.

First of all, the building and atmosphere is awesome. I think it used to be a Bank of America? They really outdid themselves with the renovations and decor. 

The drinks, while pricey, are really good. I had the basil-gin-strawberry drink and it was deeeelishhhh. My husband had a tasty IPA he has never had before. 

Service was good. Our server seemed to have a zillion tables and still was attentive and pleasant. 

When it comes to food, my husband and I had different experiences. He had the Vigazz burger which he thought was outstanding. It is now tied with 2 other burgers for his favorite burgers of all time. 

Vegetarian entrees are limited to a couple salads and a veggie sandwich. I had the veggie sandwich which was decent but I wasn't impressed. Although the grilled veggies were tasty the sandwich was dry overall. The foccacia was a little too doughy. And the caramelized onions were more raw than caramelized. The french fries were good but the barbeque seasoning on them annoyed me slightly. I think next time I will ask if I can order a grilled cheese off the kids menu. With a side of their yummy spicy mayo.

Talking about kids menu, that was another miss. Having a stepson myself, I appreciate hip establishments that are still kid friendly. However there was a very obnoxious group of kids and parents that looked like they just came from the kids soccer game. The kids dominated the bocce court and were loud, rude, and obnoxious. The parents were enjoying their cocktails and ignored their kids behavior. It kind of ruined the mood for us. I wish they would have just gone to Peter Piper like most kids teams do after a game...

We do really want to return. Maybe for happy hour or brunch. I want to try their bloody marys and the Amber Scramble. We might even take our kid. But don't worry- he will be well supervised! :)",1
"Took the family to the recent opening of this local Logan's Roadhouse to check it out and maybe find a new local 'gem'. 
Initial impressions were that Logan's is an imitation of one of my favorite family steakhouses, Texas Roadhouse. We go there every chance we can and have never been disappointed in the quality of food or service. 
Anyway back to Logan's, atmosphere was 'okay' (again a wannabe Texas Roadhouse but not quite right), service was fine, but once the food came, that 'sealed the deal' - very disappointing. Not that it was bad or anything, but the quality of the steaks just wasn't anywhere close to what you get at Texas Roadhouse, and when the prices are about the same, well, there's just no sense wasting time or money here. You might think I'm being rough but when all 3 of my kids (ages 7-11) say that they like Texas better, that's gotta say something (they usually never say anything bad - they usually just eat whats in front of them!)
So by now you can obviously guess that I don't recommend Logan's.  I really only have one more thing to add....
.....Don't mess with Texas.....",0
"I have never had BBQ in the South, Texas, or anywhere outside of California (except Bobby Q), but of all the places I've tried, Bobby Q is my current favorite BBQ place EVER!  I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.  We ordered babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, corn, and mac&cheese.  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD!

Everything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.

I don't know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.  I want Bobby Q right now.",1
"Great in its day, now leaves a lot to be desired.  Deserves credit as a Phoenix landmark Chinese restaurant.  

This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  I've been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.  

The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.  

I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years. 

Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.

A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special ""Chinese cakes"" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.  

If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.  Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on...",0
"I love this place! Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out! (just let them know if you're in a  hurry)

P.S. The phone number is area code 480 not 490 :)",1
"I absolutely love the food here! the service is good, the food is excellent and as far as the price goes..I can't complain. this is one of favorite places to eat.",1
"I was really excited about this event, maybe my expectations were too high, because I was really underwhelmed.  Very little shade, ran out of water, by the time I got there at 1pm (other obligations) 20% of the vendors were out of food, and by the time I ate my way through some, everyone else was already out.   60 bucks for that?  I don't think so.  

And when I mentioned it to ""the person in charge"", he was patronizing, invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were.  Well, I'm your consumer, big guy.  

Sorry, Devoured, wish it could have been better. 

What food I did try, was pretty good.",0
"I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid.

"I like Pei Wei, its good when I want something fast. But the main reason for my review on here today was to say HOW AMAZING the manager was at this location. 

I came in at lunch and it was VERY busy. There was a line to the door. There were some arguments about someone stealing a seat (unhappy customer, complaining because a seat was saved and they had waited in line, wanted to be comped because of it.... so dumb if you ask me. I mean just deal with it people! Its busy!) But the manager dealt with it so professionally, and when I was next in line he did not act rushed, he was very helpful, and told me that if I did not like what I ordered to just tell him and he would get me something new. I work in the restaurant business (a much higher priced place) and this manager was awesome! Good job man!",1
"It's about time I write a review for Kona Grill... after all, I've been here more times than I can count and 2 of these times occurred this week alone!  

Kona Grill is a chain which makes me want to give them only 3 stars, but considering their food is quality, they offer a fun atmosphere, and their service is decent... I'm giving 4 stars instead.

As many of the reviews before mine say, happy hour at Kona is great.  From 3 - 7, they offer 1/2 off a small menu of appetizers, sushi rolls, pizzas, and drinks.  (They also have a reverse happy hour from 10pm on I think).  I can't speak for the pizzas (I've never tried them), but the potsticker appetizer is great, and so is the sushi.  If I'm not concerned about happy hour prices, I've often ordered other menu items such as seaweed salad, edamame, nigiri, and the seabass entree too.  I've never been disappointed.

I usually do not choose Kona as a destination, but if I'm in the area, at the mall, or someone else chooses it, I'm happy going to Kona every now and then.  It's good for what it is - take it or leave it!",1
"Best time to work out at this gym is in the early morning.  Went in the afternoon a few times and it's usually packed.  

This place has everything I need to work out. (threadmill, free weights, machines, basketball court, swimming pool, and sauna).  Rarely do I see any of the machines out of order/ broken.  Although the men's sauna bench was broken for maybe 2-3 months before they finally fixed it.",0
"I would echo many of the positive things others have mentioned about Phoenix City Grille. Everything I had here was just downright good. Ribs were mouthwatering, fall off the bone, marinated fresh each morning and not overcoated, perfect. Really didn't even need the sauce they had such flavor already.

Black bean soup was nice and the chopped salad was real good too with a nice peanut dressing. Nice wine list with plenty of affordable by-the-glass options. And the server we had was nice too, my companion and I stumbled in after a hike to Piestewa Peak and were definitely underdressed, but everyone was nice about it and they clearly wanted out business and valued us as customers.

If I lived in this area of Phoenix, this would be in my rotation for sure.",1
"In addition to the nice atmosphere on the patio they serve a very nice brunch menu and the $2 bloody marys are a buy. Downside: parking validation is only a discount, not a freebie. Depending on when you go the service can be slow. During a recent happy hour the barmaid herself was left to tend to all bar patrons and the patio.",0
"New to the Scottsdale area, I've been searching for a nail salon for a few weeks. I stumbled upon this place and was very happy. Although it's in a weird strip mall, it's really relaxing inside. My gel manicure was perfect, and the shoulder massage was a nice added extra! Totally recommend!",1
"Just the facts re: full dinner experience:

Ambiance: Thinking about redecorating the house to look just like Trader Vic's - unbelievable.
Service: perfectly charming, informative and attentive.
Drinks: I don't drink, so read every other review for a review of drinks.
Appetizer: Beef Cho-Cho - amazingly tender, it melts in your mouth. Great flavor.
Dinner: Trader Vic's Calcutta Curries: good & better when you mix in the variety of garnishes.  fun to play around with the flavors.
Dinner 2: Chinese BBQ Flat Iron Steak: Amazing.  Crispy onions, mashed potatoes and tender/flavorful steak will make you close your eyes and wish it would never end.
Dessert: (don't know the name) vanilla icecream covered in coconut
 on a bed of chocolate sauce: simple, beautiful and tasty. 

Overall experience: the best darn dinner experience I've ever had.",1
"4.5 stars!

I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of ""market-made granola"" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)

I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)

p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!  

Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??

"I bought a new mountain bike from them in Dec 2011. The buying experience was great, my salesperson was very knowledgeable and they had the bike built in a couple of hours. 

My problem was the included 90 day tuneup. They didn't do any of the work that needed to be done and gave the bike back to me with my brakes rubbing, gears not shifting correctly, and wheels that needed to be trued.

After spending thousands of dollars on my bike and accessories I expected more. They only give one tuneup at Landis (less then many of their competitors) so I wish things would have been done correctly. I will be bringing my bike to another shop for service in the future.",0
"Was here for a KYOT Wine-Down-Wednesday event a couple of years ago.  The bar area was packed.  Stood around waiting for a table to open up- very uncomfortable as the area is pretty small.  

I remember trying the New England clam chowder.  Tasty, but it had too much potatoes and not enough clams.  Had something else, but can't recall which, and the current menu online reflects a few changes.  

I do recall thinking I would like to come back and have lunch or dinner there, so I'm giving it three stars.",0
"2 stars because I really did like the eye doctor I saw, she was awsome.  

Thought I was off to a good start getting new glasses.  I picked out my frames while I waited to be taken care of.  

Oh...wait...the eye glass gods had something else in store for me.  

The person helping me couldn't get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours.  He actually told me I had to pay full price or come back tomorrow.  Now keep in mind that I have had this insurance forever, never had any problems before; after hours, weekends, etc.  So I used my cell and called the insurance company.  I get someone on the phone who is trying to help us.  I put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone, handed it back to me and said here you talk to her, I'm done.  

So the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesn't happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if I was sure I shouldn't switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior.  

But I thought I was done.  I have my glasses picked out and I needed them to drive.  So while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear.  

So I lost 1/2 hour of my time and think the worst is over

Well...those darn eye glass gods...I can't get them in an hour because it was too late in the day the guy tells me.  He has the right lens and it was only 6:00 pm,  come back tomorrow.  

So I called today and was told 1/2 hour and they will be ready.  I drive over there on my lunch hour and guess what.  They aren't even close to being ready.  So I walk around the mall, come back and guess what, only 1 pair is ready.  That would normally be ok but the attitude of the two guys working is arrogant and not very customer friendly.  I laugh it off and leave.  

So what are the odds I'll get my glasses after work today???  One can only wonder.  Awful service, unprofessional and unpleasant to experience.",0
"I just had my first Tammie Coe cake last week for my birthday, and I will NEVER be the same again.  I don't normally eat cake, in fact, if it's not Brownies, I don't eat it.  But this cake drew me in with it's appealing fondant.  From there, I got lost in the spongy richness of the cake.  A cornicopia of flaverful goodness.

So make a metal note to yourself, I will only eat Brownies and Tamie Coe cakes.

Oh, and special thanks to Arts G (previous review) for telling me what the hell fondant is.  I was just calling it ""sheet like frosting"".",1
"Appears to be CLOSED.

Phone number not in service. Went by last week & was all locked up with a realtor sign on the building.",0
"I'm not a big ""organic"" kind of guy.  I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that.  For me it all about flavor and service - it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I can.

Having said that, I'm HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst!  Service is family oriented too.  They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die for.

As a die-hard burger man, this is my default stop.  It is close to the house, in a pleasant shopping center, and has the best burger I've ever eaten in Phoenix.  I'd give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me.  This place is that good!",1
I went here for my birthday this year. The best part was my friends picked up the tab:) The food was fantastic. When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice. The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs.....well maybe that wasn't a bad thing after all.,1
"Dined outside. It's a must do when the weather is right.
Fit's nicely into the 'Fashion Square' mentality an aura.
Great appetizers and they did a great job on the steak.
We'll go back again sometime.",1
I like their seating area. It has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store. One of my favorite locations.,1
"Love it!
The food is VERY spicy though.  Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :)

Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded.

I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there.  Evidently he loves the food.",1
"Came here on a Friday night to split some wings and a cheeseburger with the lady.  Well, if you want to split a burger they charge you $1.50 for this.  Hmm.  Why were my wings not charged an additional $1.50?  I understand their thought process but we were not hungry enough to order 2 dishes and waste food.  Also, for a sports bar on a Friday night, I expect beers to be continually full, not waiting 10 minutes in between.  I'll be back for the wings and for a change but the customer service definitely will be remembered.",0
"One of my favorite aspects of this Central Phoenix wine bar is that it is still somewhat ""undiscovered,"" aka not teeming with hipsters and young professionals on a Thursday evening after work. It stays busy, but not jam packed. 

Their Happy Hour is great, nice $5 small plate options, and you must try their cherry lemon drop martini. Seriously delicious. Get a ride from someone, because you'll probably want another :) 

The decor is cool and they play French movies on a large screen in the back of the restaurant. I also have a special place in my heart for their awesome sweet potato fries! This place is a great option if you want a nice glass of wine and a bite to eat in Central Phoenix but don't want to brave the Postino crowds.",1
"Love this place, it's on our dinner rotation. The owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars. Great place and cheap too. Try the #100 its the best ever.",1
"I'll be back! 

Laura certainly doesn't need my review for help, but all of these people are correct.  She is meticulous, easy to be around and takes joy in her work.  When I read all of the 5 star reviews, I sort of thought they might be written by friends because they were so gushy.  I found her via Yelp.... and loved her! 

$20 eyebrow wax, takes credit cards.",1
"Holy manfest '07.
I think I was one of the 20 women (not including the waitresses) in Tilted Kilt yesterday.
It was raining men.  And I liked it. 
A few minutes after entering the bar, I knew exactly why I was surrounded by a sea of men- the waitresses were barely wearing any clothes. 
Let me clarify: they did have tiny skirts on, even tinier tops and their bras were hanging out, so I guess that constitutes as clothes.
The outfits were cute, but extremely revealing, so much so that even I had a hard time looking our waitress in the eye and I know the guys around me were having the same problem.
The bartenders (all men) were all pretty cute. And wearing kilts.  All I kept thinking yesterday was that they must make some pretty damn good money to warrant wearing a skirt to work.
The food is pretty good too and their menu is extensive.  You'll find the usual apps, sandwiches, tons of salads, chicken fingers, wings and so on. 
But the real highlight of Tilted Kilt for me was when I found little purse hooks underneath the bar. I thought that was awesome. 
Way to look out for the ladies Tilted Kilt.",1
"I went to Pei Wei last night for a casual girls' night dinner.  It was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following:

-it's cheap
-it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups)
-there is plenty to choose from on the menu
-for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc...

That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.

I'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is!

PS - shout out to all the girls that came out last night - I had fun seeing all of you and can't wait for the next one!",0
"Don't go to Dos for authentic Mexican food or stellar service, you'll be disappointed.  Go to Dos for a fun atmosphere, good Happy hour and cheap ""bar"" food... then you'll be pleased!  Dos usually hits the spot after a hot day at the baseball game or for a first stop before a night out on the town.  It has all the essentials, food, ATM, toilets and a huge selection of booze!",0
The food was ok.  Waitress forgot my guacamole.  Wait staff continually bumped into our table.  Great wine list.  Nice decor.  I may or may not try again.  Not impressed by the food. Id go up to Narcisse or True Food instead.,0
"I went here with a party of 4 on Saturday night and it was surprisingly dead.  Not that that's a bad thing because I don't like crowds.  The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like you're in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiter's first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok.

I was pissed we couldn't get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf?

I'm a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didn't like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst I've ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!).

Here is a rundown of the food:

* bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top
* tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella.
* pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels.
* burger - pretty solid but nothing special
* mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again.
* tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.

The main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time. 

I was going to give this place 3 stars but I just can't.  They try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique, have fresh ingredients, and have a local twist.  I will return.",1
Have been to Pita Jungle twice before. Feel the wait staff do a good job. Always friendly and good service. Best hummus in town. For s dollar more get the bigger plate of hummus but ask for extra pitas (39 cents each) and some extra cucumbers and tomatoes (99 cents). Not a fancy place but certainly someplace you want to try out.,1
One of my favorite places  to get Indian food. I'm vegan so I love that there is so much  to choose from. My all time favorite is the chili gobi and vegetable manchurian. I'm so glad Udupi reopened.,1
"Growing up near this little hole in the wall, this place was a constant stop for my family. It's really good, greasy chinese food that basically tastes like you would expect it to. Now that I live farther away I still have cravings for their delicious orange chicken and chicken fried rice. If you're nearby during lunch try out a lunch special, really great prices!",0
"Blue 32 wins my MVP award. I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run, and loved every moment of it! 

Despite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and black-out World Series Championship daze (that will probably continue for at least another month or so), I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching.

Here are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here: 1. Food - This is the best bar food ever! You must try their onion rings, they are crazy delicious. Also if you aren't in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well. 2. TVs - Sports fans, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to TVs. Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant. No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32's TVs.

Go here for a game and you won't be disappointed. I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games. Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and you've got to check this place out!

P.S. GO GIANTS! =)",1
"Soft opening, so still working out the kinks. Food was deelish. 
Scallop poppers- crispy and spicy; not at all greasy
Honey chicken-a little sticky but so good
Teriyaki chicken-subtler than other places' teriyaki, but much better flavor and chicken was tender
""tootzi"" roll- bursting with flavor and rolled perfectly
Nice touches with cucumber water, upscale Asian decor, unique glasses, menus, plates, etc.
Will definitely be back.",1
"Stopped in Sunday for lunch after a high recommendation from a friend of mine in San Diego.   She claimed it was the best sub she's ever had so I had to try it.  Unfortunately my sub came up short with lack of taste and toppings.  When we pulled up I noticed it was super busy and was thinking man they must have great subs for it to be so packed.  Was lucky to get a booth inside but it wasn't as clean as others have stated in other reviews.  I had to take one of their comment cards and wipe the table of all crumbs on the ground as others had obviously done from the looks of the floor.  I had the Chipotle Cheese Steak sub that I split with my husband.  The bread tasted ok, but it wasn't fresh out of the oven. They skimpt on the steak and hardly saw any onions at all on it.  For the price of the sandwich I really was expecting to get more.  The sauce was the best thing about it but I was wanting more of it as well.  I won't be going back.  Sad that it wasn't a better first impression.",0
"My eyebrows definitely needed some love...I've ignored them so long that they're starting to resemble 2 fat caterpillars and I'll soon risk a uni-brow if something isn't done stat. 

Did you say FREE waxing? I'm a sucker for free stuff. 

The center is very sterile - not only in a clean and sanitary way, but also void of any personality. It's a chain though and they're trying to go for the 'European' vibe so I'll let them off the hook. 

The gal who did my wax was really nice, wore surgeons gloves, and carefully applied this purple gooey wax to my face, waited for it to dry, then pulled it off. It hurt a lot less than regular wax, and the fact that it was purple made it just seem cooler all around. I walked out 15 minutes later with clean brows and an appointment for my next wax. Definitely a good find.",1
"Brackin's is my new favorite day drinking spot.  The bar itself is located perfectly within a tucked-away area in the Old Town Scottsdale mall area.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, and when the owners swing by, they really make an effort to get to know you.  Prices are also very relaxed, with bottled beer landing right around $3 for domestics.  All in all, if you are looking for a spot to hang out with a couple drinks, maybe enjoy some live music, and do some people watching; I would definitely recommend Brackin's.",1
"great food, freaky good service, fantastic atmosphere.  Highly recommend sitting on patio, inside looked a bit loud.  Patio is fantastic, it is one of a few in Phoenix where it doesn't overlook a parking lot.  This is my new favorite place to take visitors.",1
"Typical unpretentious dive bar where you can meet a friend after work, play pool, watch sports, whatever...  There's a pretty big food menu too.  I had the nachos once and they were quite filling and tasty.  Nice happy hour specials also.  I heard it was a place to watch Ohio State sports but it was pretty dead when I went there to watch a football game.  However, it was kind of nice getting a prime spot in front of a huge tv and the service was really good.",0
This is an awesome family owned business. We've had consistently fresh and delicious food each time we've been here. They homemake things like their ranch dressing to take them to a different level than other places. Highly recommend this place. Prices are not bad either.,1
"This review is a little late coming, but just got myself some fabulous chocolates and remembered how addicted I am to the passion fruit ones. It's a good things they're so pricey or I would probably eat an entire box.
Julia Baker also did our wedding cake in 2010. The cake was a beautiful three tier red velvet. It tasted amazing, we still get compliments on it. Julia and all her employees were a joy to work with, the tasting appointment was one of our favorite parts of wedding planning. Would definitely recommend.

Lost a star because they are a tad bit overpriced. Also the design on our cake was the wrong color, our wedding color was an olive green and the cake design was a bright almost neon green and we had asked for an olive or dark emerald color. If there wasn't a million other things going on I might have stressed about it but as it were the cake tasted great enough to make up for it.

They didn't last too long at the Montelucia, which is usually when I'd stop in for a treat. I'm not sure where they moved but I know that you can buy the truffles and chocolates (seriously try the passion fruit) at AJ's Fine Foods in the area.",1
"Having a record store in the Memorial Union always made me nervous.  Nearly everything in that building is specifically designed to rip students off and I didn't think that Hoodlums could possibly be an exception.

Fortunately, that assumption was incorrect.  Hoodlums had a diverse selection, awesome sales, and an incredibly knowledgeable staff.  The went well beyond the pop charts and were always helpful.  The atmosphere was nice, particularly once they moved into the basement.

The store suffered smoke damage in a fire last autumn and the store is not going to re-open in the union.  On their website, it states that it should reappear in the future in another location and I have my fingers crossed.",1
Super cool coffee bar with a great outdoor patio for little ones to run around!,1
"Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time. UH-mazing! Every type of candy ever created and more candies that you've never even heard of. Best part about it was that it was super affordable. It was like a mini-costco of just candy. 

I ended up going twice on Saturday. Love it!",1
"I have been here at least 10 times and have never had a complaint.  The staff is friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is lovely.  

My favorites - the LB lavosh and spicy cottage cheese.

I will continue to come back to Local Breeze again and again!",1
"I am always on the prowl for a good burger so when I heard there was a new burger place in Tempe I knew I had to try it out.

The boyfriend and I went to Lobby's on a Friday night. It was not busy but the location doesn't really lend itself to busy. So we were able to walk right in and order. It's an order at the counter and grab a seat kinda place. We both ordered cheeseburgers and got an order of fries to share. I liked that the burgers were not pre-made frozen patties. They threw down two hunks of beef on the grill.

The burgers were tasty, a nice size - not too big, not too small - and the fixin's were fresh. So was the bun. 
The fries were crinkle cut but they were crispy and good.

The atmosphere was fine, good for a quick sit-down and the staff was friendly.

I hope they can survive in this location because they are worth a repeat visit for sure.",1
"I love Stax. They introduced me to the world of quinoa. Their quinoa black bean burger is sensational. I do the ""Build your own burger"" and get garlic aioli and the house ketchup. I am a big fan of their sweet potato fries, as well.  The service has always been great and the prices are reasonable. This is a good alternative to Delux, if you are in downtown Scottsdale.",1
I have been to many Thai restaurants in the Valley and this is the one that I aways go back to. Their roasted duck is consistently good. Get the Ped gang daeng (801).,1
"Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.

Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!

Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.

My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.

I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.

I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!",1
"I wish I could give this location a big fat ZERO.

But you can't.  But I can let everyone know how horrible it is.

For starters, their automatic doors do not even work.  I just find that appalling.  How can your doors not work on your store?  How are people supposed to get in there to shop.

The manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk.  I asked for help and all I received was attitude.

For a struggling supermarket that filed for bankruptcy, I would think service would be one thing you could promote at no cost.  But, not here.

I don't think it will be long before this location closes.  RIP!",0
"Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm! Half price appetizers and good drink prices. I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles.

And pretty much everything I've had there is good. I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing. It's right next to the movies so it's a good place to meetup too.",1
"Okay now this is a large chain and on average it's okay to good!  and I have been to this place many, many times, but I have to say the last time I went there for the happy hour hot wings (they were dry, over cooked) then I had ordered a steak and seafood combo (Cajun) something but after my second brew I thought it was me, so I had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty!!!!  It tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food, but my waitress assured me that could not have happened ""because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made"" (Gross, that did it for me) I  was outta there with the quickness...",0
"Zupas officially opens today! I was invited to their VIP catering event a few days ago and was able to get a sneak peek. 

The soups are very good; I tasted all of them! My favorites are the wild mushroom it is very creamy and has a great flavor. The shrimp and sausage gumbo is very hearty with just a little New Orleans kick! I recommend them both! If you enjoy tomato soup theirs is a tomato basil and it is yummy!. One thing I really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it! Bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from!

I had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good. You can get a 7.99 combo of any 2 items soup, salad, sandwich. By the way it's not 1/2 sizes with that combo either! I got a full panini and full soup.

The soda bar is nice to you can create your own drinks!

The ingredients are fresh and the employee's are very friendly. 

They also cater which is a big plus!",1
"Big fan of their SW Chicken Caesar salad and fire roasted tomato soup. My favorite sandwiches are the chicken panini, the turkey cranberry, and the teriyakki chicken wrap. I love both wildflower and Paradise but Paradise Bakery has the best cookies. And although I do not get it very often because its a killer in calories, the chocolate cheesecake brownie is to die for!",0
"Love this place.  Bring some patience because the wait is sometimes long and there is little seating.  The outside patio is excellent in the fall and early spring!

But I gave it 5 stars for a reason - and that is because the awesomeness of the food absolutely outweighs the wait time.  I acknowledge that this is a personal choice - but if you go and try any of the sandwiches, you'll likely agree.",1
"I am from NYC and have been in Phoenix for a few months! This Native NY'er is within walking distance from my hotel. I've been going their for about two months on Friday and Saturday nights for food, drinks and the karaoke. The food was OK, the drinks specials were good and the service was also good. The problem is that when a confrontation erupted at the bar the staff did not respond quilckly to notify the police. So, I ended up geting injured and when I asked them to call the police the did not, I had to. And after the episode they said they hoped It would not affect me not coming back again! Not even a comp or something! Just an I'm sorry what happened! I will not be returning at all. I looked over my nine charges on my statements and seen I had spent over $300 their. There loss!",0
We've eaten at this location quite a few times. We've always enjoyed it. The pizza is great and the employees are friendly. We also threw my son's 6th birthday party here in sept. Our hostess assigned to our party was great and very patient with all the kids.  My son said it was the best party ever. We'll definately be having more parties here!,1
"When we first got here I felt disappointed until I realized the zoo is much larger than it first appears. Particularly worthy of checking out - the lions and tigers. Also do not pass up the monkey walk. The little squirrel monkeys are fun to watch. 

Be sure to shell out the extra bucks to feed the giraffes. It's a unique experience to be so close to these large, yet gentle, creatures. Definitely my favorite part of my visit.

Visit Date: 11/19/09",1
"One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix. Always an upscale, posh vibe, but with very generous prices on entrees. Good looking people throughout this bar. 

The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now. 

Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays-- great drink specials too.",1
"I used to be a Los Sombrero's local. Started going (1998) before they were in their current location. The past few years Los Sombreros has gone hill. Increasing prices and food not as good. Marg's are subpar now. Los Sombrero's is no longer living up to what it used to be. Food is still good, just no longer great. All great things change and I am sad to see Los Sombreros change for the worse. 

The original chef/owner Jeff Smedstad has left and started Elote in Sedona - I must try there as I here it's what Los Sombreros used to be.",0
"Mmm!  Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes.

I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.  I'm a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didn't have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy.

I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.  It was fantastic!  I can't wait to go back.

...also, I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for ""making the drive to their location and to compensate for high-gas prices"".  A memorable gesture!",1
"nice location , good service but a little slow. been here twice so far and both times the food i would give 4 stars but both times they screwed up our orders and burger was cold, they did take off 20 percent for the issue and that was nice.. overall i enjoy the food and would go back.",0
"My friend refers to this place as ""Hitler's Bunker"" but I choose to see the romantic side of Kazimierz.  I love the dark, cool interior with the large comfy sofas and chairs.  

It can be daunting to find a bottle of wine since the list is incredibly vast.  I usually settle for a wine flight like the French Kiss or I open up the book to a random page and swirl my finger around until I land on a bottle in my price range.  The flat bread pizzas and fruit and cheese trays have been nothing but impressive.  Some of the waitstaff can be a bit surly but most of the interactions have been quite positive.

All in all I think this is a superb place to take a date after a nice dinner so you can unwind.",1
"Third visit was lower than second, which was lower than first.  Excellent service, but declining food quality.  Bacon was chewy, eggs ordered ""over hard"" were nearly raw in the middle.  Manager was rude to me and snapping at the help, who were doing a wonderful job.  Must have been having a very bad day.  I might try them one more time, but probably will move on to better places.",0
"Hip hop sandwich shop.  Not a traditional dining experience.  Food was great, and prices were very great.  Everything on menu was under $10.  Mac and Cheese is worth ordering as an appetizer, and the BLT was rediculously delicious. 

I look forward to going back again, and probably again.",1
"After 6 years of searching I have finally found Laura!  My brows have never really been ""bad"" per se, but not great either...I have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches, and Laura did just that.  After only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance. Its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference! 

I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointments...and she always has great music playing in the background too!

Thanks Laura!",1
"I have never written a negative review but unfortunately I think this place needs to get it together. It is in a location that never seems to be successful. I drug my husband over excited to try it and hoping to see an improvement. No such luck. No vegetarian entree, not really kid friendsly, small portions, pricey. Not what we were looking for in an evening. Love to support new restaurants but wont be back. Hope they figure it out and make it work.",0
"Saw this place on Triple D so I decided to give her try. My expectations were high and when I arrived I was shocked that on a Thursday morning the line was extra extra long. Had to wait patiently which when it comes to food I don't like. 

But needless to say the wait was worth it because when I got in there I was served quickly. I ordered the pork chop, eggs, and hash browns.  The pork chop there is fabulous and the toast and home made grape jelly was good. 

I would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone who is in the downtown area of Phoenix. Make sure to try the bacon too.",1
Wow. Best breakfast I had on my recent trip to Scottsdale. Ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash. Waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically don't do side dishes. That sweet little angel of a waitress made my day! Best corned beef hash EVER! Have I mentioned how awesome the waitresses were? And damn pretty as well. Double score.,1
"I ordered the BBQ sampler.  Chicken, pork, beef, and ribs!  yum!  

Then I washed it down with their red cream soda and root beer.  yum!

Me = SATISFIED!",1
"I'll agree that this is a great meet up place in the city. Nice neighborhood, adequate parking in the structure behind, and a greta atmosphere with great service. The menu is interesting and I'd come back to try more but here's what our first visit was like.

As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone I'd go back.

My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. I'm talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, it's one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Here's what it reads for the ""meat"" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ];

So, the takeaway here is stay away from the Gyro. 

But, Hey!  Gyro IS a pita. I expected a reasonable execution. Heck, make a Gyro meatloaf and slice it up at least. 

Yes, I'm bitter.",0
"I visited Carly's for a weekday lunch when I was downtown for work. Here is the rundown:
1) parking is horrid - common downtown, so take the lightrail (the stop is on Central and Roosevelt) or bring a fist full of quarters for the meter
2) it is crowded! well it was when I was there
3) the service was pretty good considering how swamped it was and I told the nice server I was in a hurry and she was able to take my order from soup to nuts in maybe 10 minutes even though their credit card machine was down
4) I ordered a gyro and their orzo pasta salad, the gyro was mediocre and bland but the pasta was wonderful

I will definitely try Carly's again when I am not rushed, the interior is hipster, funky, low key and the staff was very friendly.",0
"I always enjoyed coming here after a long night of work. The staff is amazingly friendly and always made my time here great.

The sliders are yummy and their appetizer platter they offer is great. You can choose between a variety of different munchies. 

Over all I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a low key, bar atmosphere.",1
"the pedicure was nice, I will give them that... but lady must have wanted 2 close shop early that day as I told her I wanted a pedi & an acrylic manicure when I first walked in. (She asked another customer to come back the next day while I was getting pedi). Needless to say, I didn't get my acrylic set, and towards the end, I could tell she was 1/2 arsing it... and they were a lil pricey... I mean, really, $5 for taking off my nail polish? I would give this place 1 star, but they did do a good job on the pedicure. not returning here...",0
Decent food at not unreasonable prices. The service is good. What is up with the hyper aggressive pigeons on the patio? The waitresses actually pass out squirt guns to the the customers to fend off the ever persistent waves of the foul fowl. At the end of your patio experience there is a certain sense of camaraderie shared with the other patrons.,0
"I've only been here once, and for good reason. To put it nicely, the service was seriously lacking. I walked in and nothing. They didn't ask if I needed help looking for something, greet me, or even acknowledge me until I was about to pay. I guess the magazine the cashier was reading was VERY important. I've been to several comic book stores and I don't need someone to hold my hand, I would just like common courtesy. On the positive it was a organized place and the selection was pretty good.",0
"If you like beer, you'll love Papago.   They have a huge beer selection and the prices are very good.  When ever I'm in Scottsdale, I make it a point to visit them.",1
"Elmer, I love you.

I have since I was a senior at Chandler High. Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and strips...and they were dang good. 

If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it.

Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro. And it is always so good. Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always fresh...thanks man.

And bless your little Mexican Heart, you serve corn dogs...so I can even come here with my crazy picky kids. 

I love you Elmer. I always will.",1
"I have only been here once and it was for a quick drink before heading to a movie but this place is my kind of hang. 

If you are a laid back bar who supports local artists, has a huge selection of boozahol and plays music that makes my heart skip, well then I guess I just love you. Plus, its on the same street as my favorite Jobot Coffee, how could I not like The Lost Leaf right? I really love that it is a really old house turned into a bar. The artist inside me wants to shoot tons of photography there. Perhaps one day I will be ""that girl"" who brings her huge slr camera to the bar. 

I will need to go when it is last friday to hear some jams and revisit this gem of a bar. This is the kind of place I'll miss when I no longer live in the PHX.",1
Julio G's lunch menu offers some very delightful dishes.  I recommend the beef flautas special with rice and beans. The wait staff was very nice and efficient.  Good group restaurant spot!,1
"Ok, im not getting the great reviews on this place. I FINALLY made it Lamar's before they closed for the day and tried a couple donuts. I have a few problems here. The big one, can we please list that ""only the donuts with holes"" are $5.49 for 6? Its a bit deceptive to just list the price of 6 and ring up the donuts and have them turn out to be well over $7. Makes me want to buy my donuts from someone else. 
   Second, these donuts are WAY over priced and they are average at best. The maple bar tastes like you are eating spoon fulls of sugar they are so sweet. And the rest of the donuts I tried were pretty stale. This will be the first and last time I will be going to Lamar's. Give me Krispy Kreme or anyone else for that matter. Thank god for Lamar's we dont have Spudnuts in the valley because they would be out of business.",0
"These dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand. They are honest and very smart. They don't take my insurance and I still go there (lets face it, dental insurance doesn't reimburse much, so it's only like a $15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning). I would never go anywhere else!",1
"The mall of malls, for sure! So many designer boutiques, so little time! On this trip, I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were! I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent. I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shopper's bliss :)
This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and I'll be back :)",1
"I love Lulus cupcakes! They always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles. This is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better. 
I love the raven! The Sales people are nice.
 So yummy! And I love that the place is pink!",1
We were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned. We all LOVED it! (that is saying a lot!) We ordered off the online menu and I called it in (she was VERY friendly) it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious!!! It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!,1
"The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.

I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:

Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, ""sorry, we don't serve your type here."" Mushroom says ""why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy).""",1
"Very nice views of Phoenix. 

Not a very challenging hike but very enjoyable. Gets steep at the very top but a couple of hard steps will get you to a nice view",1
"The last time I was at The Vig, they tricked me.. You see, they have these glass doors that they open up in the back of the restaurant when its nice out, and sometimes, when you go through those doors from the outside to take a trip to the loo, they close them on you, so like an asshole, you attempt to walk back outside the way you came, but instead you bash your head and knees into the glass window in front of 35 people. Be mindful of this.

But hey, at least they had the most amazing wine specials that night and I was saucy enough to laugh it off and take a bow. And then I hid in the bocce ball pit for the remainder of the evening where I somehow acquired 200 bruises. 

I love the Vig. Even when I'm embarrassing the shit out of myself.",1
"I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. 

The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.  

As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.    

My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?""  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.  

oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.  

Tommy Bahama and I just didn't work out at all.",0
"I flew out of (and into) this airport for the holidays. The process was painless once inside the airport, but their setup with the roads, ramps, and terminals is so absolutely convoluted. I've never been to a more confusing airport with regards to traffic.

That being said, once inside, it was quick to check-in and get my bags checked. I also was traveling with my puppy who was so warmly welcomed by everyone, staff and otherwise. They had no issue with him being out, unlike other airports.

A huge perk is a dog park they have outside Terminal 4 to walk dogs before/after flying. Made me feel a lot less nervous about the 5+ hour trip across the country, and I'm sure it made my dachshund a lot happier too!",1
"Meh... I am surprised to read all the reviews about the clean store everyone else wrote about. In my experience, the toppings area looked like it had all merged to become one big nest. There were also speckles and swipes of fro-yo in all places imaginable... floor, counters, scale... And, I wanted to try a couple flavors, but there was no one around to help. Also, the checkout lady was soooooo dreary! With her monotone listlessness, she made me feel as depressed as Sylvia Plath! (just kidding, but she couldn't have been more doldrums if she tried)

I usually go to Yogurtology at Town & Country mall (on Camelback just east of the 51). That place is always amazing... Pristine clean, neat, organized, always a peppy guy by the machines with little sampler cups, a guy who had one too many Red Bulls and is nearly throwing at least one sample of every single flavor at every single person who walks in the door, with a funny, witty little quip and a great personality and WAY too damn much energy. But it's nice.

THAT is what I had in mind when I discovered THIS place. I was excited. It was so much nearer to my house... great location (stupid layout though, prone to human traffic jams).

I really, really want to like Yogurtland, but I just can't talk myself into it. The fro-yo was good (aside from the fact that I had trouble getting toppings without being too grossed out since it was a mess), but that was about it. All in all, they're lucky I felt generous today and gave them 3 stars, because I really had to talk myself out of giving them only 2.

"I have read several raving reviews of this place.  I was disappointed the first time so I went back again thinking I had an off experience.  I was still disappointed.  I had the carne torta the first time and the cubana the second.  The food was okay.  Not bad but not filling and not as good as some other places I can name off the top of my head.  The first time the torta came with chips and the 2nd time they came alone.  For 6 or 7 bucks Id expect a little more.  Here are a few places with much better tortas: Los Reyes De La Torta (7th st & Hatcher), El Gallo Blanco (Central & Indian), and El Nopalito (24th st and Thomas).",0
"A perfectly good place for a chill Friday night dinner. I absolutely loved the atmosphere. Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! 

The chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. 

The service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait. 

We just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview. I enjoyed my experience there. While it's not a place that I'm dieing to try again, if someone suggests Mexican, and we're nearby, I'd recommend it.",0
"Walked in during late lunch hour. Did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins. When I finally got sat down, and served my salad, I found a hair in it. Got no apology. Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away. You can't pay me to go back here. The waiters are rude.",0
"my son loves the splash pad! His dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while I can run in the store or two that I need to! There are quite a few empty retail spots, hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well,",1
"I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasn't very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubio's and the Blue Burrito just didn't stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba.

This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.  

The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that ""punched in the stomach"" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).  

I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often! 

P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know!
(ku-doh-ba???)",1
I seriously can't get enough of this spicy goodness! All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else. I've been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam! BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection. I'm actually craving it as I type this.,1
"I want to like Turf, but the food is just okay.  I've only been here twice, but it was not mind-blowing.

I'm not fond of the shepherd's pie here.  It is the most bland version I have had... even in this town.  

The wings, however, are pretty good.  I've eaten wings here with a couple Harps and have had a decent time.

Surprisingly good is their seared ahi tuna.  It is pretty weird to think an Irish pub would do this well, but they do.  A friend ordered it and after shaking my head and saying there's no way it could be good, I tried a bite and I had to eat crow.  

Turf is typically a stop on the pub crawl, so I will definitely be back again for boozing.",0
"very laid back, very clean. This was my first piercing since I was a little kid. I had my tongue piercing it was very professional and they answered all of my questions. I went to this place specifically because of the good ratings they had online. My friend also had a tragus piercing here that went seamlessly also. I felt very safe and comfortable.",1
"Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After 
Cited as ""the best pizza in America"" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. 
My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. 
When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another ""slice of heaven"". 
And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, ""Well, the wait hasn't changed"". 
Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, ""Are you cooking tonight?"" To which he replied, ""No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore."" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. 
At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! 
So what makes for the ""best pizza in America"" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!",1
"My boyfriend and I tried this place last year and we haven't been back since. The food was really unspectacular, they weren't really that hot. The price is a bit high since there's a restaurant by the same name on Southern and Dobson that serve much better food for less. The decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural, it does not appeal to their clientele. Lastly, the staff was not nice.",0
"The boy and I finally check this place out last night. 
It was everything I imagined it to be. Great view from the semi-outdoors bar area, lots of beers on tap, and nice patio area. It was a Monday night so they weren't very busy, which was nice, I wasn't in the mood for a crowed. 

When checking out their menu online I saw they have my favorite beer on tap, SeaDog Wild Blueberry. It was delicious! Completely different on draft, but yummy all the same. They also had an Apple Cider on draft, my pick over a pear cider any day, that I could have in my Black Velvet (cider and Guinness). I was a happy camper. 

Only downer was that they closed a bit earlier than we would have liked, but no worries we will just have to come back again soon to try some more beers. 

The bartender was great, she let us try anything we wanted before committing to a full on pint. I tried to get the boy to be adventurous, but he stuck with the Stella, not bad at all, just a little boring. Oh well ;-)

I am looking forward to checking out Stand-Up Live soon as well, and the live bands they have at Copper Blue. I also hear they ahve a pretty awesome Ladies night on Thursdays, saweet! Menty menty more trips in my future, I can just see it. :-)",1
"**********This Time We Didn't  Do Carry-Out**********

*********Brown Rice instead of White ......... ALSO $2.00**********
The Soups are TERRIBLE.",0
"The food is good and the location is perfect. A solid breakfast spot in Oldtown. Everything on the menu looks fantastic. I went the healthy route this morning and went with the Quick Start Conscious. 4 egg whites, broccoli, tomato, fruit and cottage cheese. Phenomenal for a healthy breakfast out.   Breakfast club also brews a pretty solid cup of coffee that gives me a pretty good buzz for only having two cups.

The only real negative is the outside seating. It seemed good in theory on a cool day in Scottsdale with temperatures only in the seventies. However, being right on Scottsdale Road, it was hard to hear the people I was eating with because of all the passing traffic. I'd advise that anyone dining here eat inside (where it unfortunately can also be a little loud since the place is always busy).",1
"My wife and I were downtown with some friends, and decided to check this place out. I ordered a pasta lunch, and chose Penne Alla Campagna and another penne with tomatoes and Mozzarella. Meh, it was just okay. The food was just okay, kind of bland and a bit overpriced. I did snag a small slice of pepperoni pizza from one of the kids at our table that was actually the best part of my meal. Would I go back, nope no sir",0
"This would most certainly be ""my"" coffee shop if I hadn't already established myself as a regular at another local shop. This brand-new, independent coffee shop has spent the money to look really nice (it even has a fountain inside!).

But what money can't buy is community and unfortunately this shop doesn't seem to have much of that. Granted, building community takes time and/or energy. For their sake, I really really hope it works out in the long-run.",1
"Great activity for kids. It's clean, spacious and safe.",1
"I like the lunch better than the breakfast at ""First Watch"", which is a bit ironic I suppose. Perhaps it should be named Second Watch?

But on to what I do like...
The ""Not Guilty Your Honor"" veggie wrap is good. It comes with a side of hummus, fruit and potatoes. Big meal!
The ""Burrito Vera Cruz"" breakfast burrito was pretty good. The Vera Cruz sauce is a mixture of salsa and hollandaise. I've never had it before trying it here and it was actually pretty tasty!
Mango iced tea is good! And they'll give you some to go if you ask!

Somethin about the potatoes just doesn't cut it for me though... And as I mentioned earlier, the breakfast just isn't my favorite. I just don't dig their omelets much.

Sign up for their email club to get a buy 1 get 1 free meal coupon.

Note: If you're vegan, order the veggie wrap and substitute avocado for the feta cheese. Get a side of salsa too.",0
"The food was flavorful and plenty of it. Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud. My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots. It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor. I had the lamb and jalapeño dish, which was kind of greasy. You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe, which goes well with the food. I'd be happy to go back and try something different.  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King, you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume.",1
"Burger was good, bun really soft and veggies were fresh. Sweet potato fries were very good as were the rings. I knock them for not having cheddar cheese, cant really have a stellar burger without it. The burger quest continues.",1
"I finally found a reasonably priced salon and a stylist who understands what I want.  Very happy with the service.  Also, the waxing lady is very nice...I think her name is Maria, does good eyebrows.  Only downside is that sometimes it is hard to get an appointment on short notice...but that's my fault for waiting until I can't stand it anymore to get my hair cut.",1
"Other then the chips and salsa (5 stars for salsa) the food is good, but not so much that I go out of my way to eat there. The fajitas are delish, with mushrooms and the meat always tender, but the price makes me cringe. At over $20 there are so many other places I rather eat. I usually opt for a cheese crisp with green onions and green chilies and a side of guacamole (which is always yummy but pricey) and I still pay for all that $15 plus what ever we are drinking.... I love the overly rustic atmosphere, but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub.... Some of the servers are not the friendliest, but these are mostly the family that work there and have been there forever, so don't take it personally....
But overall it is a Scottsdale landmark that is fun to bring out of towers to and the food is overall good.",0
Just tried this place this afternoon. Very friendly staff & great rates with no commitments. You don't need to worry about paying some $25-$40 co pay like at a regular Chiropractic's office each time you visit. It's $49 a month and you get four visits a month. It's not like massage envy where you have to sign a contract for a year and its hard to quit. This goes month to month. Try it out once for $19 if you want. This company is really growing. So stop by and see for yourself!!,1
"We love 5th and Wine and recommend it to anyone that asks, the appetizers and wine specials for Happy Hour are some of the best in town. Let's start off with the fact that every glass of wine on the wine list, that's right every glass, is just $5 during Happy Hour from 3 - 6 pm.

Did someone mention appetizers? Yep, 5th has you covered there too. Ever tried Fried Pickles? Love them! But I have to admit it took some convincing to win us over... thanks Scott! The fried pickles are thinly cut, fried to perfection and served with a creamy horseradish sauce for dipping.

But what 5th and Wine is really known for at Happy Hour is their Bruchetta. They have 6 types to try but may we recommend this selection of our favorites: Apple and Brie; Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella; and the Steak and Horseradish. It's a great threesome! As someone mentioned last night, the bread is not too hard, very flavorful and toasted just right.

"FnB is how every restaurant should be. Unfortunately this will not happen because Pavle Milic, who runs the place, cannot be at every restaurant. 

This is a small, friendly restaurant in my hood, that just happens to have some of the best food you will find. I always feel welcomed & taken care of by the staff. I've come here with friends, but I've also come alone & felt totally welcome. I like sitting up at the counter, and I've actually met some really great people to chat with there. Pavle & his wife run the place, & they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there.

Chef Charlene does things with food that make it amazing, & these are things that I myself could never accomplish. My main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu. I just wish I had the funds to eat here more often.

In conclusion, fabulous food combined with wonderful service make me feel lucky to have FnB in my neighborhood. :)",1
This place is great for a big group of people. We originally thought we were going to have 6 people. We ended up having 11 by the time everyone showed up. The staff was more than happy to accommodate us. The Kota Athenian chicken is very good. The price range is moderate. All in all a fantastic place.,1
"These are not real French treats. I'm surprised some of the reviewers say they've been to Paris. First of all, they're not macaroons (those are Jewish coconut cookies) they are macarons (one ""o"") and these were the most amateur macarons I've seen. The feet are big (the feet are the rim of the cookie) and the cookie body itsself is airy and thin whereas a true macaron is light but doesn't actually have air pockets in it (the cookie dough is still present throughout). The filling is not ganache like it should be - it's a buttercream like you use for cupcakes. 

Chocolate croissant was decent so I'll add a star for that.",0
"I was visiting Tempe for Ironman Arizona and came down with pretty acute foot injury three days prior to the race.  The friendly receptionist at Dr. Natcher's office understood the predicament I was in and managed to fit me into Dr. Natcher's schedule within a couple hours of my call.  Dr. Natcher's is clearly both a great doctor and a great person; she is extremely competent, friendly, and sympathetic.  As an  runner and cyclist, she is also in tune with sports injuries and the mentality of an athlete. She quickly diagnosed the injury and prescribed an aggressive treatment protocol.  I was in good shape on race day (due to her treatment protocol) and am so very thankful to Dr. Natcher for putting me in the position to complete the race in fine fashion.  I was paying out-of-pocket, and  was very pleasantly surprised by the cost of the office visit.  I can't speak highly enough of my experience with Dr. Natcher.",1
"was super duper busy when i ordered. but then again, they were a fast food place, and i waited for my To Go order for 25 minutes. They have 5 or 6 people inside their kitchen. And a lot were waiting for their food cos there were some mixed up. Will go back though cos I know those things happen when it's a busy day. The food was bomb specially the hotdog!",0
"I love the fish tacos from Rubios, I always order them. Well sometimes I get the shrimp or Salmon tacos and I also love that black salsa chipotle sauce and the chips are delish here.",1
"I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza STILL tasted horrible.

Barely average fast food quality and taste. Avoid!",0
"My girlfriend i love, love, love this place. Excellent food, beers, and wine to enjoy on premises.   Friendly, helpful, and funny staff.  A wonderful grocery to shop from, and an amazing selection of cheese and wine.  It's a total foodie destination.  This place is fantastic.  Ahwahtukee (and Phoenix in general) needs more quality driven, food and wine centric places like this.",1
"Just a quick review to reiterate how truly great this place is.

They've got soda, lots of soda.  That's right, I said soda! They've got root beer, sarsaparilla, freaky foreign sodas, teas, waters and other things. 

I love this place, I have no complaints. The only thing that would make this place better would be the addition of beer. Man, if these guys hooked up with the dudes that run the beer section of Topps  Liquors it would be unstopable!",1
"For some reason or another this macy's has a better selection of shoes than the one at Scottsdale mall. In the past year I found a pair of Calvin Klein sandals for half off, and they carry the higher end, younger brands- which is great Nordstrom's selection tends to be for an older crowd.",0
We went there right before my Grandma's 100th birthday.  There were about 20 of us.  The place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didn't have a final count of people.  The place was busy but I know why.  EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it.  Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much.  We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place.  Extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had!  The staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat!,1
Another new great place in the Arcadia neighborhood  to grab some great food and select a drink from the extensive beer and wine list.  I think there were over 60 beers and 40 wines to choose from.  I thoroughly enjoyed the tomato and candied pancetta bruschetta and the lamb kefta...yummy!  Definitely check this place out when the weather is cooler and you can enjoy the view of Camelback Mountain from the patio.,1

Love it.  The wines are good and they have drink specials ($5 glasses!) and the place looks great, and it's light railable!  The panini was good, not special, but the creme brule made me forget all about it.  And work.  And oil spills.  And life.  Thank god my body's innate intelligence didn't forget about breathing or bladder control.  Those stayed intact.

And the bruschetta what what!",1
"Pho-yuck this place! 

I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese. I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house. 

The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it, it was literally served on a plate of grease. 

The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor, the rice noodles were slimy, the spring roll was loaded with grease. 

I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.

The service was horrible and I will not be back.",0
"I really enjoyed my stay here!

We used a groupon and I will stay there again when I visit Arizona.  The rooms were very tidy, bath and body works collection available for shampoo and soap.  

I loved how the pool was open all night as well.  The pool and hot tub did need a bit of scooping because there was some debri in there but nothing terrible.  Towels were available as well as water too for the guests.

The front desk people were very pleasant and gave us an early check in no problem.  

My fiance and I wanted to go down to Mill avenue and were pleasantly surprised when the front desk said there was a 24 hour complimentary shuttle that would take us and pick us up.  The driver was very helpful with advice on places to go and also tips to keep out of trouble. :)

We went to Milagros for a margarita too, and the bartender was very pleasant and the drinks were not crazy expensive.

The hotel is very close to Arizona Mills mall and other places in Tempe.  It was worth every penny!",1
Great food and very friendly service.  Happy to recommend!,1
"I LOVE love LOVE Coffee Bean.  I have been in love with Coffee Bean for years.  I am so bummed out that they are not all over the place like the ""S"" coffee store.  

One of my favie drinks are the Pure Cholocate Ice Blended with whip cream and Green Tea Latte.  The service is always friendly, perky, and fully of sunshine.",1
"Three-star service, but five-star ambience=four estrellas. Let's face it, marina restaurants don't have to push too hard to succeed. Competition along the shoreline is minimal. When the cooler runs low on the boat, Lakeside Restaurant is the only show in town. You can tie up at the little restaurant dock, where the sign warns of a 30 minute limit, which is laughable given the snail-paced service. Sit on the patio and toss a few crumbs to the waiting ducks and, further down the food chain, the circling iridescent big-mouth carp. Feathered, scaled, and furry scavengers vie for patio scraps. The water is clear and calm, and the view stunning. The coffee is weak and watery, if plentiful, and the omelettes are big and fluffy, if bland. The heavily inked wait staff is polite if a little rough around the edges, but props to folks who are sturdy enough tackle a full-time wilderness gig like this. Note: these are the best restrooms within 20 miles.",1
"After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots. 

As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)",1
"A very  good sandwhich shop!  My boy and I stopped in here after a movie at the AMC.  They have a neat concept with the bags on the wall where you mark your items.

My only wish is that they had cold sandwhiches as well as the toasted variety.  I am not always (rarely in fact) in the mood for a toasted sandwhich.

The italian sandwhich I got though was delicious.
NOM NOM NOM",0
"Consistanly great steaks and flavor for sure.  Today was our maybe 10th visit to Texas RH and we keep coming back.  Today's waitress Stacie was an absolute DITZ and let's just say it's a good thing I was in a good mood.  My Ribeye was as tender and tasty as I expect, wife tried the Ribs for the 1st time and they were tender for sure.  Bring your appetite and some time (if you come Fri/Sat after 530) as I am sure you will enjoy as well!",1
"We attended this restaurant for an early seating at 5 p.m. and were immediately impressed with the atmosphere and professional staff.   Both were first class.

We decided to sit at the counter overlooking the chefs preparing the food and we were glad we did.  One young fellow was more than happy to answer any questions we had regarding the preparation as well as the presentation of the food.  It really was fun to watch the whole process.

We decided to go straight to the entree instead of filling up on an appetizer beforehand and we were glad we chose to do that.  We each ordered the Kobe Vaca Encebollada, which was a grilled Kobe skirt steak nestled on a bed of caramelized onions.  Alongside the steak were three slices of potato about a half inch thick and these were topped with a guacamole type mixture as well as other toppings.  They were absolutely delicious and I was so sad to reach the end of those.  The steak was cooked to absolute perfection and I was determined to clean my plate because it, too, was just so scrumptious!  It was a very ample portion and we did clean our plates and definitely had no room for dessert, unfortunately.  As our cocktail, we followed another reviewers lead and ordered virgin mojitos, which were $9.50/ea and they were delicious and also sufficed as a dessert stand-in so the tab wasn't too crazy at all.  Well worth it for that delicious steak.

We did dress up for the occasion and were glad we did as everyone was dressed casually but nice.  It's fun to have the whole experience for a special night out.  

We look forward to returning soon.",1
"Yes, I am a fan. Particularly of the brunches! They bake their pancakes which makes them ooooh so good. The King's cakes are delicious and are baked with bananas and chocolate in them and served with peanut butter (which I'm personally not a fan of). The portions are very very generous. On a nice day, the patio is great. Comfy seats, evap cooler outside, misting system. Most people don't know about their brunches I assume, since the entire place was empty when we were there at 10am. The dinners are great as well. The pulled pork sandwich and their pizzas are surprisingly good! It definitely has a commercial feel to it, but I believe it's a local business which I'm all for.",1
"My super close, local taco shop. For me, consistency is key, and Filiberto's is always a step above most other restaurants ending with ""to's"" in that regard.  I'm fairly mental for their Chicken Soft Tacos on corn tortillas. Larger than a typical street taco, they are almost sized more like a mini burrito - Shredded Chicken, a red pepper sauce, lettuce, and melted cheddar = AWESOME. Tuesdays they are only $1, all day!  Finally their Adobada tacos are a bargain at thrice the price. Avoid the Chili Relleno burrito, however. It may be one of the worst things to ever get passed through a drive-thru window.",1
"While I don't like to hype places up (because really, how GOOD can any one place be) ...How good can one burger joint be over another, or how good can pizza be over another pizza place (when weighing the ones that are all generally Good in the Public Opinion).  Now the word around town is that The Grind is Sofa_King Great.  I will say about The Grind that when you're up for a Burger, this place hits the spot.  I've been here once before August 2010 (don't remember what burger I had but recall it was good) and the other night I had the Peppercorn Burger and it was as good as it gets.  I was starving and really hadn't eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot, but make no mistake, it was really good and I do enjoy this place for the atmosphere, service, and quality of food.  My friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot.  The sweet potato fries (we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries) and they were good.

As for some other areas to review: The atmosphere is nice.  It's casual and not too dark and not too light inside.  (That's how I like it).  There's multiple flat panel TV's above the bar, so plenty of games on at any given time (That's also how I like it).  The service is fine (although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service.  That's often going to be the case with most casual establishments - so sometimes it's good, and sometimes not to our satisfaction).  Such is Life!  Anyway, back on track here, the Wait staff and Bar staff have been worth the 20% tip both times.  No complaints by me about this place, however I do see some 2 and 3 star ratings on here.  

Where I will dock 1 star and sort of agree with Kristi D.  She mentioned the large photo of Sheriff Joe Arpaio on the wall (while I sense that Kristi doesn't care for Sheriff Joe, I'm neutral about him), but I agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in The Grind.  I'd much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall - and not photos of Sheriff Joe, Mark Grace (for those who don't know, he's a former baseball player), and the Mayor of Paradise Valley, all holding their burgers.  Who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers.  I think I'd be more ok with having these photos above me, but they are HUGE enlargements and a bit overkill.  And they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause.  Look, I'm all for causes and shit, but I wouldn't spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local ""notables"" holding a burger.  The whole concept is pretty stupid.  But hey, I'm generally uptight and been doing photography 20+ years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall.
 
Side Note:  For those who might have previously had ""Liked"" The Grind on Facebook but no longer have their page as a Like, it's because they apparently had their group page hacked, so they had to start over.  I found this out when I Liked it the other day noticed there were only about 165 Like's, and certainly I knew this place was way more popular than that.  When I commented that, they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over.

"Had lunch at Zinc for the first time recently right as they were opening.  Considering they were not yet busy, we had pretty mediocre service.  To begin with, we were not offered bread.  Since it was our first visit, I wouldn't have necessarily assumed we would get bread, but I noticed other tables had it, so naturally I felt slighted.  And then the cardinal sin of serving.  I was maybe 25% through my meal, when our server appeared with our check and asked if we would like dessert.  Well, I don't know.  I haven't really eaten yet.  My husband wasn't even finished, and he eats like he's still in the military.  Needless to say, I just took the check and short-changed her tip in return for short-changing the time I was apparently allotted for eating. 

As for the food.  I had the macaroni au gratin with smoked ham as well as their up sell of parmesan truffle fries.  I liked the mac and cheese.  Not the best I've had, but pretty good.  The fries were okay.  But I've never understood the concept of dressing up plain 'ole french fries and serving them with ketchup.  If I'm not going to get a nice aioli or some other special dipping sauce, I'd rather just have the fries sans all the other crap.

I wouldn't necessarily object to a return visit if I'm in the area, but I won't be breaking down their door.  Just as well, I doubt they would care.",0
"Great ice cream, but still just ice cream. Really enjoyed the salted caramel alongside a scoop of sweet corn. Feel a little silly for driving from Phoenix just for the taste but no complaints.",0
This place is an experience.  I can't stop thinking about it!!!  I love the weird odd flavors (Basil Lime?)  and everything tastes so fresh and organic.  It's nice to have something like this close by our house!  A true guilty pleasure.,1
"Had a friend invite/take me to lunch here at The Mission.  The physical place was great!  I had the arepas which were good, not great.  My friend had the tacos, which immediately upon being served them he realized he'd have to order something else (small portion).

My portion for the arepas was plenty as the venezuelan sandwich itself is filling, but also came with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries, which were good.  Actually the ketchup/dipping sauce was awesome now that I think of it.

Price -- hmm, a bit overpriced for lunch in my opinion, but I suppose that is Scottsdale.  That's really what was the difference between a 3 and 4 star for me here.",0
"My girlfriend and I were hungry and wanted to try something new, so we hopped on the netbook and fired up Yelp. We tried Crazy Jim's, and boy was this a good pick. When we 1st rolled up to CJ's my girl was like ""I don't know about this!!!"" I said ""lets just go in and take a look, if it is clean inside then lets try it"". Once inside the place was small but quaint and most important it was CLEAN. So I ordered a veggie pita and got the pasta salad as a side. The food was ready pretty fast and I had envisioned something like a sandwich that you pickup and eat but it was all laid out over my plate. The pita was very good and I give a big thumbs up to, the pasta salad was kinda plain. My girl has a greek salad and she liked it but wasn't too crazy about the dressing. I would definitely go back to Crazy Jim's and eat. As a matter of fact anytime I am craving that veggie pita, your boy ""E"" will come to visit. 

ps. Our server was great also, friendly, fast and helpful.",1
"They must have had a slammed lunch as I came in around 1:30 ( by the time I found my way back from the old station) and for a new place the counters were dirty.  
I hate when the counter help is eating in the dining room, I feel like I am inconveniencing them.  The vegetarian choices are limited and the Pho was good for 8 bucks.  I have eaten Pho at another place in Mesa and enjoyed it more. 
I won't run back to this one but if someone else was paying and wouldn't cave to other suggestions I would not die of it either.",0
"After driving by this place about a million times I finally remembered it when the old ""Where shall we go to eat"" question came up and I am now definitely a fan. I asked the server (Chico - he was great and seemed to really love working there) about his recommendations and tried the Salmon Spinach Enchilada which will be difficult to move on from when I go back. It was absolutely amazing and I tried my hardest to finish my plate. Only reason I did not give this place five stars is that the ambiance in the back room was a bit lacking. It was more cafeteria-styled and just not very warm and inviting.
Regardless, I know that I will be back and definitely introduce this place to out of town guests!",1
"He's been the top vote-getting General Dentist in Phoenix Magazine for three years in a row for a REASON, folks. He has an office in Chandler and in Mesa but even if you live in Minnesota, he's worth the drive.",1
"During the work week I have to eat out for lunch quite a bit and I get tired of paying 10+ for lunch. I remembered hearing something about Boston Market having a $5 lunch special so I figured I would go check it out... Finally there is a place that has good, somewhat healthy and well priced lunches! Your choice of carver sandwich with soup/salad and a drink, they have soup and salad and I can't remember the others but it was a pretty nice selection. 

You pay more at McDonald's for a combo and this is way better! If you are out and about for lunch I would highly recommend going here. I'm sure most people have eaten here before so the food won't be a big surprise but the price is GREAT! This will definitely be a go to for me.",1
"I don't often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just looking for a good bite to eat. This time, though I feel I should if not to balance the ridiculous number of 4 and 5 stars bouncing around for this place.
The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class. 

I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.

The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before. 

In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review. 

I am not planning a return anytime soon.",0
"This place is great. The Pizzas are single serving or post salad and some of the best Pizza Ive ever had. Salads are good and and service is excellent.

"Even though I am officially in my 30s, I look like I'm still in college, which made me feel slightly less uncomfortable when I walked into The Clubhouse. Yes, it is near ASU, and yes, it is an all-age venue, so I should have expected that the club would be filled with 18-20 somethings. But just because I look 21, doesn't mean that my internal reality made me feel a little out-of-place. But, I was like, whateva!

It is somewhat of a dive bar trying to be a club but failing miserably. Like a nerd trying to be punk or a cheerleader trying to be emo -- it somehow didn't work for me. It felt like I was in someone's basement turned rocker's haven. Black walls, haphazard decor, and one sole stinky quasi-couch that looked like it had been salvaged from some dump. 

The stage was at the front of the club, and the bar in the middle dissected the under-21 crowd from the over-21 boozers. Unfortunately, if you wanted to drink, you had to stay on the over-21 side of the bar. That sucked because you barely had a view of the stage. WTF?!  Shouldn't the paying lushes get a better view than the youngsters who only paid to get in the club? Stupid. I have to say, though, the sound system was a helluva lot better than some of the other small music venues I've been to.  That's a plus.  

Finally, this last annoyance will definitely show my age, but having to stand the entire time I was there was horrible. My feet hurt, dammit! And, I just wanted to sit down! But, I'll suck it up the next time because there are some great bands that play here, and for me, great music can make any situation better.",0
"I'm usually a big fan of dive bars but wasn't impressed, at all.  One of the kegs was empty so my friends didn't get their ""favorite"" beer, not a huge deal but not a good thing for 5pm on a Friday.  The servers seemed really overwhelmed and was probably due to the fact that there were only 4 for the entire place and it was really busy.

On a very positive note, my friends said that the food was really good for bar food.

This might be a great place for any day and time other than happy hour on a Friday.",0
"yum yum yum. I love Oregano's Pizza! I've always loved Oregano's... but especially the last time I went. There was a long line outside and the wait for us was 30-45mins, which I thought I was going to dread...but the servers were really nice. We were able to order drinks in the waiting area and they even came by us several times to give out pizza samples.",1
"When I walked through the swinging doors around noon on a Sunday, I walked into Hooterville.  Think silicone, fake tans, bleached hair and  teeth and caked-on makeup.  And the men here overdose on testosterone: full of bulk and attitude.  Think sideways baseball hats, torn jeans, flip flops and gold.  Even at noon on a Sunday, they were on the hunt.  

Joining me in alienation was my San-Franciscan friend.  We represented the world of natural size and color.  To bring ourselves comfort and escape in this fake world surrounding us, we discussed environmental concerns.  

I got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  Commensurate with the theme here, this was the biggest breast I'd ever seen.  The sauce was super hot and tasty.  The baked beans had a southwestern flare - with crushed pepper.  My friend got the chili, which he said was slightly spicy hot but not temperature-hot.  

I didn't attempt the bucking broncho, for many reasons, but one of them being that there was nothing on it to hold on to.  Too difficult for a delicate northerner like me.",0
"Bookmans is Great!  They probably don't need another positive review but so what.  I use Bookmans for recycling books I've read and for buying used books for myself.  All I can say is that I like everything about the way they do business.  They have great people working there.  The store vibe is very positive.  Their prices are very fair and what they pay for your used books is incredibly fair, plus you know that you've made a positive contribution to our society by recycling books that others can enjoy.  Do yourself a favor and stop in.  Enjoy!",1
"I've only hiked Camelback once, but I felt so accomplished (albeit winded, and mere minutes away from passing out).

We started the hike at 6 in the morning, and got to watch the sunrise while we made our way up the trail.  I thought it wasn't going to be a bad hike, but things get tougher about two-thirds up.  Things starting getting vertical at some points, and I wasn't really prepared for that.

It was totally worth it once we got to the top, though - gorgeous, 360 view of the Phoenix metro area (and really, much more than that).  And watching the sunrise with someone special is pretty awesome too.",1
"I love Mexican food. Today I ate half of a taco and simply had to stop; not in a good way either. The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper. The beans were flavorless. The rice was hard and lacked any flavor. Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste. 

The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.

The service was average, but I found it odd that my waitress didn't find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted.",0
"I've gone back a few times since my last review. Every single experience has been fantastic! The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!! Sooooo freaken amazing! 

Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect! 

And the fried cheese curd...just get it! I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!",1
"Terrible rolls. The Dragon was so so. The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food. Seriously, it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible.",0
"I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)

The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  

We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.

We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.

We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.

Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  

I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:

1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  

2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.

Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!",1
I really wasn't impressed with the service or the food.,0
"It looked like shrimp and it taste like shrimp but it wasn't shrimp. It looked like chicken and it taste like chicken but it wasn't chicken. It was all tofu and 100% vegan AND it was all amazingly great.  Even Amy's mock pork was surprisingly very pork like and I love pork.  You see, I love meat and it's very seldom that I go a day without meat in any given deal. However, this full ""mock"" meat experience was pretty cool and enlightening.  Not only was the lil establishment very clean but the owner was super cool and informative.  Although I don't see myself converting to full veganism anytime soon, I'll definitely be back to try a few more vegan-mock meat dishes. 
Boba Juice is also my new go to place for a much needed icy cold smoothie with boba of course. I've tried a few variations and my favorite is the taro/coconut smoothie, add boba.  I swung by Boba three days in a row for a smoothie and that's a pretty solid indicator that I like the place.  Yay, I am a fan!",1
"We popped in here for a brew while walking around heritage square.
The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive.
Note: if you just want a brew - you can order it inside!
We went with a local Hefe and it was great!
The options for noshing look great, but we were headed for dinner so we didn't get a chance to try them out!
See you there soon!",1
"I found this place when we needed a place to meet for a business lunch.  I had the smoked BBQ chicken which was good but that seems to be all I get when I go.  I've tried some of the other dishes but haven't really liked them.  My wife loves the fried pickles which I'm not a fan of.  The portions are huge but there does not seem to be anything special I can remember besides really large portions.  I suppose the biscuits topped with sugar smothered in honey butter are good but I also want to live to be at least 50 and they are not worth dying for.  As unimpressed as I am with the food, the service is very good.  I've been there a few times now and have always been pleased with they way they treat us.  Everything from the speed and attentiveness has been good.",1
"I haven't been here in quite a while, but when I was coming here, they had a jazz band doing rock and alternative covers (their name is The Latest, though I don't think they play here anymore). The place is totally trendy, but I really see that as a good thing here.",1
I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location. The staff looks miserable and are SLOW. The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back. Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean. The rice was crunchy like it wasn't cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy. Never again!,0
"Love this place!  Was in phoenix 3 weeks for work.  Ate here 3 times.  The squid salad is amazing!  They also have sushi, bibimbap, and tons of other items.  Must try!",1
"Intimate ambiance with good farm to table fare. Good presentation and wine pairings. Outdoor area is nice, though as others have pointed out, there's basically no lighting back to the parking lot after dark.",1
"I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were ""socializing"" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)",0
"Alright this is the deal of deals, 2.75 for students and Im not sure if its a quarter more or not, but less 4 dollars. half an ice cream cookie sandwiches, trust me its enough.  

Its a great pick me up for something sweet on mill

Cookies are made their along with the good ice cream, and if your not into that they have italian ice.

Place is small, but is packed with flavor, and smells like fresh cookies.

Recommendation: If you love cookies made into sandwiches",1
"I have a fond place in my heart for this establishment

I've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ years

I've lived all over the world

I always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA)
1.  Skim Milk
2.  Mexican food
3.  Tokyo Express

Now pay attention

If you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should order

An all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl
5 extra sides of spicy sauce
A small salad
2 extra sides of salad dressing

Ok, so I REALLY like sauce.  Really.

This place makes me want to cry I love it so much.",1
"Uh-oh. Where am I? 

The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. 

Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. ""Don't worry,"" I told my friend. ""This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street."" Oh, little did I know. 

Let me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. 

The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. 

We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. ""Onward!"" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. 

A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us ""lost,"" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. ""Let's ask somebody,"" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, ""Will this trail loop back around?"" ""Where do you want to go?"" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. 

We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.

We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. 

Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. ""Let's hitch a ride,"" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. 

That's when a car slowed down. ""Ugh, creep,"" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, ""We can take him."" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. 

We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. 

The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. 

We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.",0
"This place is great if you are looking for something sweet and are in Scottsdale. I had the tin roof sundae and it was out of this world. I love sweet and salty together. Sugar Bowl is also open late so its a great place to go if you are hungry or drunk or have the muchies and need something good to eat. The service, however, is a little slow and I would never dream of going during normal hours (I have been late at night) with the amount of kids that are probably there!",1
"(aka. SKETCHY TEMPE with BONNIE G, Part One of Three)

I was in Tempe. I was having coffee. I was sedate. I wanted to see if anyone wanted join me and discuss Kafka or something boring. And so I called up the town's most famous resident to see what was goin' down.

""Um, YOU need to see sketchy Tempe. It is time. And I will be the one who will show it to you. Meet me at Time Out Lounge. No, wait. Meet me at Monkey Pants. Yes, Monkey Pants!""

And so I did. 

Monkey Pants! Sorry folks, but this name is nonsensically awesome. I walked in and sat myself at the round bar, joining a smattering of other patrons sitting there by themselves, each staring into nowhere in particular. Well drinks for $2.50, served in a standard kitchen glass. Nice! I proceeded to watch the football game and was soon joined by my Tempe tour guide.

We were approached by the bartender to do discounted Patron shots....but only if we wore sombreros. There was barely anyone here on a Sunday night, and I'm of the kind who doesn't care anyway, and the thought of me and Bonnie G sitting at a desolate stripmall bar with sombreros on is kind of ridiculous and great at the same time, but shots were not on my agenda for the night. Alas.

I then got a royal tour of the place, including the great leg lamp (actually it's two legs, not just one!), shuffleboard, pool tables, couches with a cozy fire being played on endless loop on a big screen TV, ample board games and another section with tables and chairs, which is where we sat, under the painting of the teddy bear in Richard Simmons gear. 

Other patrons were seated all over the large space, so everyone had their own private area in a way. I actually really dug this. I'm not one who needs a place to be crowded to enjoy myself or feel like ""it's happening."" Sitting around a fake fire with pints and board games with a few friends is more my speed these days anyway. So I may sound decrepit, but I'm really not that old. I swear.

Sure, Monkey Pants has frat-party gimmicks throughout the day, but this place has no pretense whatsoever. How can you even take it seriously? Even it doesn't take itself seriously. 

I mean, it's just sitting there. In a strip mall. In Tempe. With a painting of a teddy bear wearing Richard Simmons workout gear on the wall and a stack of sombreros sitting next to a popcorn machine. Waiting for you to leave your critical mind behind and enjoy the now.

And enjoy the now we did. 

All thanks to my Sketchy Tempe tour guide.

4 stars.

"So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house, in the middle of the desert, no less! Who would have thunk it.

Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale, where great coffee is few and far between.",1
"I hate having to give out three star reviews. For me, 1-star isn't the worst possible rating you can an establishment, a 3 is. Because 3 stars means it invoked no reaction to you, neither joy or disgust, no pleasure or pain. 

I'd rather eat at a really shitty place that I'll remember than a so-so eatery that I'll forget the moment I get back into my truck.

If I want mediocre ""take it or leave it"" food I'll just cook for myself, kthxbye.

As BFeF's (Best Frienemies Forever), Clarice W and I frequently have lunch together in the Peoria area. The decision on what to eat is usually made using the following criteria: Where haven't we been that we can yelp about?

Our last lunch involved us going to Hope Kee and getting all wrapped up in their cutesy snack section and coming in late to work. So we needed somewhere relatively closer with no Hello Kitty gummi lips to distract us from our voyage back.

Clarice suggested Casa Filipina, a Filipino place by the Lenny's Burger somewhere near but not necessarily 35th Avenue.

We were welcomed in by the staff and taken immediately to a nice cozy table by the window. We were given our menus by the excited and talkative waiter I would come later to know as ""that fucking guy"". 

At first I was a little troubled reading the menu. I was once in a relationship with a Filipino girl that was so tumultuous and unloving that when I seriously thought of breaking up with her that my first thought ""but  man, I love her mother's cooking..."". 

But aside from the adobo and lumpia, I saw nothing else on the menu that I could recall from all those awkward awkward family dinners.

I can't tell if this means there's more to the cuisine than I'm aware of or that said ex's mother was, as well as a good cook, a fucking liar. 

Either way, I'm glad I left her in the end anyway.

I ordered the Dinguan, which translates as ""chocolate pork"".

Don't be fooled by the name, all you saucy foodies out there thinking of that Iron Chef America where they made savory dishes with chocolate.

Chocolate pork is actually pork cooked in pig's blood. 

I'll repeat that.

It's pig's blood. It's called ""chocolate pork"" because the blood takes on a brownish-black hue after it's been cooked.

After hearing this from that fucking guy, Clarice changed her original order (we even order the same thing! aren't we just the cutest!) to the Bistek Tagalog, which she was familiar with and knew she would like.

All the entries come with at CFB is a side of ride. I'm not sure if it's jasmine, white, or saffron, because I always opt for noodles when given the option. 

And if you get that fucking guy, that rice doesn't even come with soy sauce. After serving us, he disappeared into the bakery, talking it up with some of the other customers. Clarice didn't get her soy sauce until after we had finished our entrees and were on our second helping of rice. 

Thankfully my chocolate pork came with a lot of sauce and I was able to dribble it on my rice. 

That's right, muchachos. We trannies prefer blood on our rice. You think about that the next time you try to tell us what bathrooms we can use, amigo.

I couldn't taste the pork. All I tasted was the blood. They could've just dumped a quart of blood on my rice and called it a day. The texture was nice though.

Clarice wasn't as fortunate with her dish. While I've tried to stay away from beef (it's enough of a commitment to keep my vegetarian brother off my back but not interfere with my eating habits), I had some of the Bistek, and it was passable. It reminded me of beef jerky, with its dry spicy roughness. Good, but not sure if that's how it's meant to taste.

Moral of the story: Clarice's entree did NOT make its own gravy, which made eating her rice a little inconvenient. 

And seriously, JUST rice (really good rice, but seriously, how hard is it to make good rice)? Even my neighborhood so-poor-it-steals-its-recipes-from-other-restaurants Chinese place gives you an eggroll or wonton with your meal. 

As the place is so fucking proud of its desserts, we ordered some. Clarice got the Creme Brulee and I got the mango tart. That fucking guy was in the middle of bringing Clarice her spoon when he caught the attention of another customer, so we sat for a good few minutes waiting to dig in. In the meantime, I managed to come up with a name for the color of the filling in my tart : burnt earwax. 

My tart was about as tasty and edible as that term would imply.

Clarice's creme brulee was good, albeit a little cold by the time that fucking guy came with her spoon.

On our way out I learned that the bill had to be over 10 dollars before they would accept debit.

After I imagined beating every one of the staff near to death with a rolling pin, I got an eclair to go.

What I got was a bunch of whipped cream between two pieces of rock-hard pastry that you'd get at Fry's. Essentially, a diabetes sandwich.

Casa Filipina isn't good. But it's not bad.

That's the proble",0
"Outback is a great restaurant. You can count on the tasty food and good service. They are reasonably priced and consistently deliver a quality product. This location gets busy during dinner time, but I've always had a good experience.",1
"This place far exceeded my expectations and is far better than staying at a Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn. This place is QUIET, CLEAN and for the money, you can't beat this place. It includes a HOT breakfast each day which means real eggs and hash browns served to you at a sit down cafe. This alone saves about $10 per person per day while traveling!

This place has THREE pools (nice if you don't want to hang out near the bar), basketball court, laundry facilities, restaurant, plenty of parking, free wi-fi, full kitchen, great housekeeping service (they cleaned our dirty dishes!), and a very courteous front desk staff.

The only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes. But for the peace and quiet, I'll take that trade-off anyday!! 

This place would be excellent for hosting reunions because of the pools, basketball courts and several sets of bbq's on central courtyards.

If you are looking for a fancy place, this isn't it. But it is an incredible bargain, comfortable, and very quiet.",1
"Typical dumpy yet fairly clean little sports bar in a strip mall setting. Get your tires changed next door at Discount Tire and grab a few heinekins while you wait. Beware though, they call it coppers because it is owned and frequented by Cops and for some reason there are a lot of people missing limbs that frequent the place.?. hum. ho.",0
"Unpretentious in Scottsdale?  There are only a couple of places that can achieve this in my book, and Mabel's is one of them.  I had been wanting to go here, but just never got around to it.  So when a friend was in town for work mid-week, we went to Mabel's for a drink on a Wednesday evening.  The place was pretty empty, but the drinks were good and the staff was nice.  The atmsophere is very swanky, with plush furniture, pictures/paintings of naked women on the walls, and ads for Mad Men.  I would love to go back on a hot night to check out the food and the crowd.",1
"3 Stars only because the house margarita and guacamole was so good.  The food was decent (fish tacos), however the patio atmosphere was a bit sad. I understand this is more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no place settings, condiments, etc... Just cheap metal tables and chairs. Also - there was no music out there, just this incessant humming of a back alley generator.  

The service was a bit sporadic out on the patio as well. We were asked by three different servers if we have a server yet. Not much in the way of organization. 

Maybe management just hasn't gotten around to fully organizing and furnishing the patio yet. I hope they do, because they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them lots of potential.",0
"I have not been to the Outback in years as past visits have, well, sucked. I am not one to complain, I just never go back if I have a bad experience or two. Seriously, there are too many good places to go out to eat to return to business who don't focus on their food. 

So my boss loves this place and she wanted to go and of course as she is the boss I agreed to return to the Outback with her. 

I have to admit this place has changed. Our server, Bree, was excellent! A server can make or break your meal and Bree was on her game. 

The food was really good, OK, I am super picky and was ready to hate it as I have in the past but tonight was different. I ordered the teriaki marinated sirloin. It came perfectly cooked at medium with sweet potato, salad and bread all for $12.95. 

Maybe I got lucky and came here on a good night but I am glad I did and will definitely return.",1
"In the mood for a little snack? this is the place. Don't remember what I ordered (my indian friend helped me), but it was good! and also try desserts!!",1
Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.,1
"I have been to FEZ twice now, when passing through Phoenix. First, the decor is amazing, an oasis of urbanity amid the heat and sprawl of Phoenix. Excellent lighting and decoration. And I love the food, a mix of Mediterranean and American fare. This last time, I had a grilled-chicken sandwich with pomegranate vinaigrette, goat cheese, sliced pears, dried cherries, and field greens on ciabatta. My dinner companions had different sandwiches, and all were good, but one of my companions said he thought his sandwich was just a tad over-sauced. The sweet-potato fries were a real treat. I plan to make FEZ a regular stop when I travel through Phoenix again.",1
"Mesa Amphitheatre is easily my favorite concert venue in the Phoenix area.  You can see and hear from anywhere in the place, and the grassy risers were such a good idea.  The sound was excellent for the two shows I've been to there.  Really just an overall nice, peaceful place to see a show and enjoy the Arizona weather.  Parking isn't too bad and neither are the lines to get in where they check your bags.  To top it all of, getting out of there was a breeze both times I was there.",1
"A very nice pizza.  I haven't made up my mind which is more authentic, NYPD or Ray's.  Both, have the thin NY style crust, but NYPD makes me feel like I'm waiting for an E train to Queens; whereas Ray's feels more upper east side-ish.",0
"It has been awhile since I have visited the Dubliner. The only reason I haven't frequented the place lately is because I don't live near them anymore so I can't just either walk home or call a cab for 5 min ride. However there drinks are strong and cheap! Either that or the bartender was being very friendly on the few times I have visited :) The food is not to shabby either. I mean you can't possibly mess up fish and chips. Hmm fish and chips. So go, check it out, but remember if you have too many, call a cab. Did I mention that their drinks are strong and cheap! #winwin!",1
"So wifey and I decided to check this place out for our monthly date night. It's a cool little spot around 12th st and Oak, in the middle of a neighborhood. The decor is very modern, but warm and inviting. We opted to get an appetizer and a few of the small plates rather than the larger plates they had. They had a balanced but approachable wine list, I had an awesome Tempranillo for under 10 bucks a glass!  We opted for the crispy shrimp and okra for the appetizer, which came with this spicy banana sauce and this cool yogurt sauce.  I really really liked this dish, the okra was great and the shrimp were succulent and perfectly cooked. Not sure about the banana sauce, but overall a great dish. We then decided to get the stuffed dates with crispy Schreiner's Chorizo and Manchego. It came with dressed spinach, prob one of my fave dishes in Phoenix right now!  We also ordered the macaroni and cheese and I forgot to mention the toasted bread and roasted garlic we ordered. The bread and garlic was just okay, nothing special.  I, surprisingly, was not a fan of the mac and cheese either, it seemed very grainy (I know it was chock full of parmesan so that's probably what it was, but it was just unappealing to me). Overall this place has potential. I'll definitely go back, especially because we got out with 3 glasses of wine and 4 small dishes with tax and tip for under $70.00!!",1
"Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.  Great outdoor seating, amazing-truly amazing mussels.  Wholeheartedly recommend, perfect ""date night"" too.",1
"They say you never forget your first.  Well, Postino Central was my first Postino and I remember my first sip and bite like it was yesterday.

The atmosphere here is very sexy at night.  Candlelight and sexy music add to the already chic ambience Postino has.  

The food?  Bliss.  I can still remember how the creamy ricotta and sweet figs on my bruschetta tantalized my tongue that first night.  I can feel the velvety red wine at the back of my mouth and drizzling down my throat.  

Parking is a bit of a hassle, but they have valet for a reason.

If you're stuck waiting for a table, squeeze in at the bar and grab a glass of wine (or three).  People watching is almost as fun here as eating.  

Now that there is a Postino in the East Valley, I am hoping Postino Central will get a little less busy... if only to serve my selfish purposes.  I love everything about this place and I hope to be back soon.",1
"Had dinner there the other day. Again - I love the design and atmosphere. Service was good but the food... not worth the $$$ they are asking for. Starting with the kids option - I ordered the pasta with marinara sauce which the server told me will have short noodles for easy pick up by a small toddler, it was made of long wide noddle, even after cutting it was not fit for a child. I ordered the grilled cheese which was okay, really not tasty as it should be. 
My friend and I shared the rock shrimp which was awful, tasteless and the shrimp was not cleaned through so we had some crunchy sand like experience. Then we shared the corn flat bread which looked and tasted like airport food. 
We decided to leave and got our check - for what we got paying that much was a big disappointment. They didn't even take the kid pasta dish off... $5 people... really? 
I will not go back unless it is for drinks only. The two stars rating is for design, location and an okay service. Food deserve ONE.",0
"Good flavors, fast service.  Love their green curry.  Great happy hour where appetizers are 1/2 off the reg price.  The downside is that most of the appetizers are deep fried.  I like lunch better than dinner as they offer a nice salad with the meal.",0
"I will preface this by saying that I went here a couple years ago for lunch and thought it was very good, which gave it an extra star over my true opinion of my dinner there last night.

The BF and I went here before seeing Louis CK for our anniversary. We were seated right away, so that was nice, but it was like 5:45 so that isn't too shocking. We sat outside, which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so I'll give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isn't enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didn't taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination.

 Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they don't do that... hmmm). We sat down at 5:45 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show (we were walking). So the experience wasn't a good one, BUT I would be willing to try it again, as I did have a very nice lunch there a few years ago.",0

Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the ""peacemakers"" were before us!  

Now that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!

Bravo Thirsty Lion!",1
"So, not following my own advice (ahem, NEVER RETURN), I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?). HA! Big mistake. Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.

I'll keep this update short and sweet:

$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.

Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. 

Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.

Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky. 

Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here. NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!",0
"Still love their product, but their online ordering process just doesn't work.  First time, my order was sent to the wrong market.  Second time, I was shorted a package of chops.  I checked the bag before I left the market, so it was only a minor inconvenience.  Third time I ordered bacon, which was listed as available on the web site, and then contacted and advised it was not and may not be available for a few weeks.  Since I paid upon ordering, I had to go through the hassle of waiting for a refund.

I've also noticed inconsistency in portion size which is a problem considering you pay by product, rather than pound.  Boneless chops should be roughly 6-oz each, yet I've received 4-oz chops at times, resulting in 50% less product for the same price.  Not a deal breaker for me, but something to consider.

I continue to purchase from these guys regularly, but no longer try to order ahead.  And I do wish they would have bacon available more often!",1
"Great restaurant!  I had the brisket sandwich and loved it.  They bring out fresh cornbread before the meal which is a bonus and small little donuts for after the meal.  The restaurant has a great decor and is a very pleasant atmosphere. If you want some good ol fashion barbecue- try this place out, you won't be let down",1
"Decent farmers market with several friendly vendors.

Look for the jalopeno peanut brittle, the incredible maccaroons, sweet republic ice cream and crepes from torched goodness! lots of yumminess and it is dog-friendly!",1
"After bad experience, I will never return.  It is terrible since they didn't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but can't even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians don't patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day.",0
"Second visit to L&L.  The first was at lunch with a group of moms second with my family.  The service was excellent which is saying a lot.  They didn't have to ask what we needed they surveyed the table and kept the meal moving.  Which I appreciated since we had the three kids with us.  This is not traditional chinese, so get the asian nachos.  They are a giant appetizer very unique and quite tasty.  EVERYONE enjoyed their meals and the happy hour deals are pretty good.  I see more visits in my future.",1
"Bacado. Yes, you read that correctly.... The ""Bacado"". It is a glorious concoction consisting of an avocado and bacon omelette with cheese on top and served with an English muffin and country fried potatoes. Decent black coffee and good service.
Delicious.",1
"Maybe it was an off night - it happens to the best of us.  I've hung out at AZ88 before several times, but on the night I plan to review the place they were so off.  AZ88 Buffalo CK Sandwich -- I'll eat one or two buffalo CK wing, but to make it a sandwich, I can't recommend.  Too much sauce! Also, make sure you chew fast because after a while the buns begin to go soggy - umm mushy bread with CK cover in buffalo sauce.... (Toast the CK it'll dry some of sauce and give a crispier texture)  Service was off too!  I had 1 beer and 2 waters -- that's all.  If you know me I like a few bottles and at least a jug of water with my meal :) - I know I can't get enough H2O!  I understand the place is popping, but after being seated, there was almost no direction for the wait staff.  Ambience is always cool and love the layout and the feel of the place.  Better luck next time! - Enjoy!",0
"Great Happy Hour. Get the TACO BASKET~!
Thursday-Mexican Beer $3",1
"I was blown away at the sheer NUMBER of books and magazines. Then when I looked at the prices- that was even better. There were books I found that were brand new and had no markings or tears, and they were still at half-price! Not to mention, if you're nerdy like me it has the 'old book' smell throughout the store. Reminds me of a rainy day in the library. My only complaint is the grumpy employees.. I get it- your job might be boring, but at least smile and return the ""hello"". As for their product knowledge, where everything is located, etc... I cannot complain. I will be back again and again. Let's just say books are an addiction of mine, and I don't want help quitting.",1
I second Sarah's review. Try the 49er flapjacks and Ron's Special Southwest Eggs (they come with nearly diaphanous potato pancakes). Don't forget to hit the ATM -- there's a Wells Fargo at 68th and Camelback.,1
"For my first time it was pretty decent. Just as everyone said it is pretty pricey. I had the taco plate which consists of two tacos, seasoned rice & refried beans. My bill was 11.57 for that. Pretty steep considering that usually runs $7 most places. But I can say 3 hours later I am still full as if I just left the table. The chips, salsa, & refried beans appetizer was a great start to meal as well. My friends have already planned the next visit in which I will try the swirled strawberry/mango margarita which is 24 oz for 6.99. Sounds like a steal. I hope the flavor is above the price.",1
"We've eaten at Arriba a few times now.  I really don't care for their food, and service is slow more often than not.  The first time we went we were there it took a good two hours!  And that's not because we're slow eaters.  We did stop in for happy hour last week though, and although their margaritas aren't the greatest, they're decent enough!  They ofter a 12 oz. house margarita for .99 or a 24 oz. grande for 4.99.  Why people would pay five times as much for a marg twice the size, I don't know.  We each had three .99 margs, ate the chips, salsa and bean dip and our bill came to 5.94.  $6 and I left with a full stomach and a buzz.  Nice!",0
"Should be called The Bad Egg. Bottom line, the hotel's free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there. 

We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated. The staff was pleasant enough. We were seated, given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet). We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didn't try my potatoes. Blech. Even with the comp, the total was over $15 for one special and two coffees. Very hight priced for nasty food, poor service, and loud/uninspiring atmosphere.",0
"Always clean and accommodating to any workout schedule.  I work near by so it is very convenient to go at lunch.

Great amenities, even a pool, and classes.  Wish there were a few more yoga classes or classes geared to those of us that are out of shape/beginners, but I'll get there.",1
"Golden Panda has a special place in my heart; the part I clog with orange chicken. I'm sure its not the most authentic Chinese meal, although i don't know, but i consider it the best Chinese take out in the area, solely based on this one item. 

Although I get the same thing every time i have on occasion tried other items that people with me have ordered. All the chicken entries are good, the same lightly fried chicken just different sauces (general tso is my 2nd favorite). The beef dishes are terrible. The seafood is just ok. The won ton soup is really good as well and is usually the second thing i will order if orange chicken isn't enough. I cant remember if the pork is any good but the won ton soup has pork in it so i would give it a shot if you like pork far more than chicken. 

The owners and servers are a bit jaded by the high school students that frequent the place during lunch but will warm up quickly if you go in there a few times. Food comes fast by the way so make sure that when you get take out that you let them know if you will take more than 5 minutes otherwise it will be done and waiting for you after 5 minutes. 

The store has few tables where you can eat but for the most part is a takeout/delivery based establishment. However if you do eat there they have Barq's red cream soda on their fountain.",1
"My dentist recommended this place to me five years ago and every since then, I keep a keen ear to any of her recommendations as Shimagamo is the best sushi I've had anywhere.  I've had sushi in CA, NY, TX and HI.   

The fish tastes fresh and the portions are generous.  One piece of advice is to eat at the sushi bar rather than one of the booths, assuming you are having sushi.  In my experience, sushi tastes better served as soon as each sushi piece prep is done rather than waiting for the entire sushi order to be completed.  This place has the best Unagi and an awesome Escolar (which I haven't found anywhere else.)  The Suprise Crazy Roll, served with a sweet wasabi sauce, is always on our Sushi order.

The only con is that this place is pricey, but they do have a daily 5-7 happy hour that contains some great options.  However, the best stuff is usually not on the happy hour menu.  Also, this isn't a place to have Sake bombs.  It's a very low key atmosphere for those just looking for an excellent meal.  You'll likely notice early on how many folks are regulars.  I was told this was the spot where many Japanese baseball players come to have their Sushi.

The restaurant is very non-descript.  It sits in a corner of a shopping mall and is easily overshadowed by it's neighbor C-Fu Gourmet.",1
This place is old but the food is good. The compliments arent that great...such as the basil and bean sprouts they give out. Their soy milk is made fresh and does not come from a Yeo's can.,0
The staff at this location was rude and unfriendly!! Also the store itself was not the cleanest I have seen!,0
"Very good battered dipped fish, cole slaw bland, fries came barely warm. Service is fast for crowd, very nice and friendly staff. I'll go back for the fried cod. Did have to exchange coffee cup. It had some funk dried and stuck to the inside wall.",1
"I came here with me sister Cher, who really likes this place. I'm so used to food being prepared by cooks and brought to me. So, I'm not used to having to prepare my own food via restaurant. I love to cook from recipes, so why should this be any different, right? 

As we arrived there wasn't that many people, I was relieved and allowed me to ask my sister 101 questions about what to do. I ended up making a concoction of beef, carrots, broccoli, rice noodles, sprouts with chef's favorite sauce. It turned out good but I know that I was missing something. I tried some of my sisters bowl and that was really good.

So, this place is a build-your-own bowl, piled high if necessary, and watch it cook right in front of you.

It was a little overwhelming at first, but if I continue to go there, I will get accustomed to the process.",0
"Have you ever tried the chicken rotisserie here? They go fast so you have to be lucky to get one unless you call ahead. Its not so much about the rotisserie chicken as it is about the amazing and creamy and smooth and exceptionally well balanced Garlic Sauce/spread they give you that goes along with the chicken. 

Have I told you how amazing this spread is. If only I knew the recipe...I would eat it by the tub...okay maybe by the spoonfuls. Anyway...try the chicken rotisserie or the chicken taook. Heck if you don't want to eat either of those things...just ask for some garlic sauce on the side with whatever you are eating. You will not be disappointed.",1
"If you're in the mood for a foodie adventure, I've got just the thing. A trip to the Caribbean! Head on over to Tempe and enter A Taste of the Caribbean restaurant. The bright yellow and green walls, red floor and outdoor furniture will make you feel like you've arrived. It's kind of scruffy and laid back - this is not the place to come for a quick bite. First of all, you have to make the tough decision about what to order. Oxtails or goat? Jerk chicken, of course, or do you want the milder brown stew chicken? Fish? There's snapper, tilapia, and shrimp. The menu is divided up into Caribbean Favorites, Friday and Saturday Menu, Lunch Specials, Rice Bowl Specials and Plate Specials. If all this has your head spinning, you're not alone. Our server, part of the family who own and run the place, seemed equally confused. But she was charming. Just accept it, and the slow service as part of the experience - don't worry, be happy.

     We ordered oxtails ($11.95) and Eggplant Curry Shrimp ($9.95). The oxtails, in a brown sauce, were fall-off-the-bone tender, fatty, as oxtails are, and totally delicious. The accompanying plantains were caramelized and a little crunchy. Perfection. A huge mound of rice and peas filled the center of the plate - moist and beautifully seasoned. And finally, a side of cabbage. There must have been a little sugar in the cooking pan, because it was sinfully delicious. Served on the side was a basket of roti, a homemade flatbread, similar to a flour tortilla but much softer. It was so hot we burned our fingers trying to pull off a piece. We had finished off the oxtails when the eggplant dish arrived (they were supposed to have come out together - it's a good thing we like to share). Be forewarned, this curry is not for the faint-of-mouth. I wasn't expecting the degree of heat - my nose started running and my eyes watered. But it was pure bliss, with flavor layered on flavor. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, although I wouldn't have minded a few more, and the eggplant was so tender it was almost melting into the gravy. There were also some pieces of potato, which had not been mentioned on the menu, hiding in there. The heap of rice and peas helped mitigate some of the heat. As you might have gathered, between the roti, the plantains, the rice and peas,and the potatoes, this is a carb-lovers paradise.

     Two odd things: a wide variety of Caribbean sodas are sold here, but no ice tea. And the rest rooms are in a different building than the restaurant.

     The only disappointment was dessert. I got a pineapple tart to take home (I couldn't have eaten another carb if my life depended on it). Our server had said it was the best of the two desserts available. Uh-oh. The tart was really bad - a smidgen of decent pineapple filling wedged between layers of leaden dough, tough and greasy. I was glad I hadn't eaten it at the restaurant, because it would have put a bad ending onto an otherwise extraordinary meal.",1
"This place is sweet, I highly recommend it.  When you walk in the door be sure to look down at the floor because you're standing on a fish tank - pretty cool.  The decor is very trendy and the atmosphere is chill.  We had a drink at the bar on a Weds. night before heading out to the patio for dinner - not overly crowded which was nice.  The sushi was delicious - quality pieces and very fresh.  My only complaint was the bathroom sink - while very cool looking, the faucets don't work unless you slam the handle in and then the water just sprays out sporadically.  This was a little messy but the rest of the experience was great.",1
"If you're looking for a lunch salad/Sandwich, this place is great.  Not too busy, but that's good because it's very quaint.  The roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat.",1
"Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for.  We've been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded, which is a shame.  Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good.  It's like a Dennys-type place, but I think the food tastes better.  I've honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I don't think that's what you go here for :)  The prices are very reasonable.  Once again, pies are TO DIE FOR! We've had their strawberry pie (x2), pumpkin pie, peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently, their mixed berry pie.  We're going to be moving across the valley and I'm actually a little upset this location won't be coming with us.",1
"BLAH is really all I can think of.  Blah, Blah, Blah.

Everything tasted the same.  Everything!  I got an open chicken burrito which is basically a burrito in a bowl, opened.  It had chicken, rice, cheese, peppers, onions and the shell.  

I ate a piece of chicken, tasted like the grill.  I ate some rice, tasted like the **Burnt** grill. I ate an onion, tasted like the grill.  I are a pepper, tasted like the grill.  I ate the cheese, tasted like a burnt grill with cheese on top. 

YUCK!  I ate about 4 forks full and was so disgusted I had to chuck it.

Fail of an airport dinner to the max!",0
Great place.  Hard to see behind Carl's Jr. on Southern Ave but is Worth finding!,1
"This place has been here 7 years and we have never been. Are you kidding me? The food is excellent. The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there, which is most important. I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich. YUMMY!!! There are many choices for salad toppings. There us nothing I like more than a huge, fresh salad. I chose to top my salad with avocado, tomato, bacon, edemame, feta cheese, and whipped balsamic vinaigrette. I really think this was the best salad I have ever had! They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing. I chose the chicken pesto sandwich. The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl. The sandwich was excellent. My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich. This is one huge sandwich! It was difficult to get his mouth around it, but once he did, it was awesome!! Typically, we don't like coleslaw, but it was really good, especially combined with the tender pork. We will return to the Market Bistro, again and again. 
Loved it!!!!",1
"I found this place based on Yelp reviews so I feel obligated to add one more 5 star review to the mix. I needed to get a chain fixed on my bike and was not looking to spend a ton of money or hours trying to fix it myself. So I stopped by and had them take a look at it. 

They recommended a full tuneup to keep it in tip top shape and spent the time explaining and demonstrating why it is deserving of spending money beyond the chain repair.  I ended up passing but didn't feel like they were trying to take advantage of me. Since it was close to closing time I left the bike with them overnight and got a call late in the morning the next day for pickup. It has been as good as new ever since. 

Having my fair share of riding in the Valley of the Sun I'm sure I'll be back soon for some inter-tubes or a spare part for whatever craigslist bike I happen to be riding around at the time.

Protip: Check out the unique bike artwork they have around the place. Also they have a small BMX (?) track in their ""backyard"" you can ride around and do jumps on anytime.",1
"We were gifted a Groupon for Fuego and had the pleasure of dining there on Friday night. We did not have a reservation, which would have helped us sit outside, but we were seated inside right away. The host was very pleasant and welcoming. 

Much has already been praised about this little gem, and I agree with all of the accolades regarding the atmosphere, the service, the food...it was all wonderful. 

We had the Fuego salad, which was huge and lovely (although I would have liked some diced onions on it; maybe I'll ask next time), the tortilla soup (husband raved about this), the Pulled Pork with cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and maple-glazed carrots, and the panko-breaded chicken breast with creamed jalapeno corn and maple-glazed carrots. 

In all it was delectable. The entrees were succulent and nicely plated. I particularly loved the creamed corn, which was perfectly spicy and helped clear by sinuses (I succumbed to a bad cold the next day, so maybe I need some more!).

The only thing I would not order again is the carrots. I didn't feel these added anything to our dinners. The maple taste was pretty subtle, to the point of being nonexistent. Also, I think that if you're going to put yourself out there as an upscale restaurant, go the extra mile and use real carrots instead of the bagged ""baby carrots"" that you can find so readily on cafeteria lines. It will look better. 

Our waiter forgot to charge us for the soup. I pointed this out, and he comped us anyway. I will definitely continue to patronize an establishment that empowers its staff to make decisions like that without worrying that they're going to get a dock in pay.

We'll be back, probably first to try out the amazing-looking Happy Hour!",1
"Went here for dinner, there were only about 6 other people in there on a Monday night. Even with 2 servers for 6 people the service was absolutely horrible. We almost walked out after not getting service for about 10 minutes.  The food itself is decent BBQ. Not great but entirely edible.  I enjoyed the blue cheese cole slaw.  When my dinner arrived the waiter said that they gave me the wrong type of sausage, they left the one they gave me and followed it with what I ordered later which was nice.  The ribs come dry, not wet but they will make them that way for you if you want.  With a crowd like this I don't know how much longer they can stay open.",0
"Dr Natalie is a compassionate, empathetic, caring DC. She listens, takes her time with you and always strives not only to make you feel better, but to keep you feeling better. Her new location is adorable. I highly recommend her!",1
"Better like it hot...these folks do not know the meaning of the word ""mild""! Plentiful, tasty Mexican fare at a good price...always a good bet.",1
"Best value for your money,   Clean, comfy beds.  Quite.  Great breakfast that is included.",1
"They had me at Baked.Goat.Cheese.   The appetizers were phenomenal, we got the Bake Goat Cheese that came with their freshly baked brick oven bread and my bf got the Romaine salad with fuji apple & bacon.  But the baked cheese was by far the better of the two.

Main courses also didn't disappoint we ordered the white fish and hanger steak.  I only had a bite of the fish so I can't speak that much to it, the bf enjoyed it.. it had too much lemon in the sauce for me, but I hate lemon flavoring so it's probably better to take his word for it!   The steak had this amazing sauce that accompanied it that added such a nice flavor to compliment the steak.  Both entrees were pretty good size portions, especially after appetizers. And we also split a side of sweet corn polenta that we couldn't finish

The actual restaurant its self is very open, there is an outside covered patio and a smaller patio for the bar that's out in the open.  

Valet only, complementary

Sat Night wait time: approx 20 mins

Clientele: On Sat night we had a big table of your typical Scottsdale Cougars, average couples and groups ranging from mid 20s to 60s and a bachelorette party of 4 girls who were barely 21 (not the typical place for a bachelorette party)",1
"So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!",0
"I really like this place!  I was surprised to see the other rating with one star.  I have been 3 times in the last 2 months- always for lunch and ordered off the menu.  The restaurant itself is clean and neat, and our food has always been fresh, hot and yes, ""simple""- but really good.  You don't feel overly full (take the rest to go) and it's not greasy or heavy.  Good stuff.",1
"Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me.  Hell, most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there.  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home.  It is so comfortable and wide open.  Even on the most crowded days, I feel like I am on the cast of cheers.  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect.  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge!  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks, they waive the pool table fee. Or you could go for some ping pong, foosball, UFC, or big buck hunting.  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard. If my girl would only let me, I would have my wedding there.",1
"Went there to photograph a concert. Great crowd and fun quirky locals. Loved the dive bar ambience without being trashy/dirty. The lighting for the show wasn't great but the sound was good. Great beers, too. Get the 99Shillings.",1
"I went here due to a Restaurant.com coupon. The menu was expensive, which made me think that it was a fancy place, but it turns out that the food was expensive because it was a restaurant inside a hotel! It was inside the Sheraton and I didn't see any signs outside indicating it was there. We'd made reservations since it was a Friday night, but they really weren't necessary, as there were only two other families in the restaurant. We'd dressed up. We were the only ones.

The restaurant area was really very modern beautiful. They'd made good use of lighting effects and there was a large, full bar wrapped along the back portion.

We ordered the Pan-Seared Cheese (which were basically fried cheese poppers - delicious, but definitely overpriced considering only 4 of them came on a plate) as an appetizer. My date ordered the Baron's Burger (your basic burger), and I ordered the Valley of the Sun Ribs. The ribs were a little dry, but I really loved the ""Arizona croquette"" that came with them. It was fried crispy on the outside with creamy mashed potatoes on the inside.

With the restaurant.com coupon, the meal was reasonably priced, but without it, I would have felt a little ripped off.",0
"The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere, but I really love the food here. I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout. I love the Gobi Manchurian, Vegetable Vindaloo, and Special Vegetable Curry. I also like the weekend buffet - it's a great way to try several different things. Delicious!",1
"Went here before the Jason Mraz concert and the Rock Shrimp appetizer, beers and cocktails were very good, however the service was a little slow. I ordered the angus cheeseburger and it came with a 1000 island dressing and pickles, a glorified Bigmac, what a disappointment.",0
"I met fellow Yelpers Brian S and Shannon M here and learned that it's all about the sandwich.  And feeling like you have walked on to a set for ""That 60's show"" or ""That 70's Show"".  It's pretty clear the owners of Casella's are focused on the sandwiches, not updating the decor.

I had an Italian beef sandwich.  It was great.  And I sat and soaked up the 70's decor as the bread from my sandwich was soaking up the juice.

This place is old school all the way - old school awesome.  F#%*ing A.  Now where's my Trans Am?",1
"This place loses out due to poor customer service, which is a shame, because the food is good.  it didn't used to always be this way.  It used to be good food with a friendly, attentive staff, but then they changed management. 

Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. 

We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? 

So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.  I can get good food elsewhere and not be treated like garbage and overcharged.",0
"luckily, i've only had to take my truck in for service once and had no issues with service or quality. it is always expensive to have something auto related repaired....wish i would've paid more attention during shop class in high school, but oh well...i can't be good at EVERYTHING.

friendly staff. they called a few times to make sure i wanted them to proceed with repairs and had my truck done in a few hours.",1
Went there today for lunch for the first time and had the del Reyes torta. I was full after one half of this monster. But was very good.,1
"I liked this place...it's a little dark.  I went in the middle of the day so there was probably more workers there than movie goers.  And the staff looked pretty bored actually.

3 bucks ain't bad for a movie.  I thought the place was clean and a decent selection of movies and refreshments.  I come from a small town so even this theatre is an upgrade for me.

For three dollars I will most definately be hitting this place more often.",1
"Gotta love Sweet Republic.... great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets. I've loved every single flavor I've had there (peanut butter, brownie swirl, mint chip, salted butter caramel, mayan chocolate, and more). Everything is made from all natural, fresh ingredients (virginia peanuts, fresh mint leaves, etc). 

When I really want to splurge I make my own sundae, you get to pick two flavors of icecream, a sauce, and a topping. 

If you haven't been to Sweet Republic, go! If you're far from Shea & 101, find them at First Fridays downtown, farmers markets, and more.",1
"Be VERY, VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap. I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich, ordered it as a wrap to go. I got home, there's lettuce and mayo and... what this? what's this I see in this sandwich? there's the cut-off fingertip of someone's glove lodged between the lettuce? (At least I hope it's the finger tip of a glove - I'm not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.) Ewwww.... gross.... I didn't finish the sandwich. Memo to self: Don't ever get wraps from Einstein's, particularly not the one on Shea. Disgusting. If it ever happens again, I'm calling a local news station to report it, then I'll call the state health department. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross... if you can't deliver sanitary wraps, THEN DON'T PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Not a place to go if you like wraps.",0
"Their service was above acceptable, but kind of slow. It was Wednesday night around 9pm and only one section in the restaurant was open for just a few groups. Their business looked very slow there. But I suppose it was a probably typical week night situation.",0
"I'm pretty sure these bagels have never seen boiling water, and to be honest they reminded me of nothing so much as the tragic frozen failbagels of my childhood.  I guess our first warning should have been the exceptionally alarming ""CAPPUCCINO"" poster in the window, showing what appeared to be (coffee?) chocolate milkshakes with whipped cream and chocolate. :(

Two stars because it was, technically, an edible bagel, though my husband and I only managed to each finish half of ours.",0
"I think there food is amazing!  However, it is a bit pricey which limits my trips there.  I love the white decor but hate how expensive the drinks are!  I ordered a Key Lime Martini and it was 15.00 for one and served in a tiny little glass!  Come on!

Additionally, last time I was there we went to the bar afterwards and most people were wearing flip flops which drives me nuts!  Take a shower, get dressed, put some effort in!  Save the flops for the pub!  Hopefully, it was just an off night because I really think it is a cool spot!",1
good place to kill an evening. I used to spend my time here many moons ago. good coffee at good prices.,1
"i'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of medium-rare steak. and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at 2am. i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat, because i think it's just psychologically strange. BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, i've had nearly everything on the menu. and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything.

my favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger. i could eat these everyday. it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but don't let it freak you out. it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce. this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware. their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch. their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious. i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos. 

their pita chips and hummus are to die for. they're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus. and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing.

green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head.",1
"Sorry.  I'm from Southern California so I'm used to great Mexican food.  We were excited to try this restaurant, since we had read some great things about it.  However, the waiter was pompous and the food was mediocre.  We were in a party of four and we all ordered different meals.  The guacamole that was made from one avocado was $11.  The restaurant is in a scary location.  We had to park in a back alley.  It was agreed that the experience was a bust.  If you're in the area and want great food, go to Lon's at the Hermosa, Elements at Sanctuary or True Food Kitchen.",0
"Sun Up is my favorite craft brewery in AZ. Brewmaster Uwe is German and brews creative - quality American ales with a euro twist. While there are regular beers, the cask conditioned and strong ales change regularly. Recently they had 4 different kinds of IPA. Central Phoenix highlight - must visit. Order off of the chalk board - seasonal ales are the highlight here.",1
"Home to the Mariners and Padres Spring Facilities, Peoria Sports Complex is a pretty great place to take in the action. I have seen a decent number of games here over the years. Most recently I saw a weekend game sitting out on the lawn. It does not get much better than relaxing on the lawn, watching some baseball, hanging out with your friends, and getting some color in the 80 degree heat. 

The practical details: (1) there are a TON of food options. Maybe too many, if you believe in such a thing. Food of all kinds is everywhere. You can get all the standard ball park fare and some more exotic things, too, like noodle dishes, sushi, fry bread, etc. (2) Ticket prices are good - sit up close for 20 bucks on down to the lawn for 6 bucks. You can't beat it for getting up close to the action (3) Parking is only 5 bucks in the lot, which I think is really decent, but if you want to walk a little further you could find street parking across the street.

BEST DEAL IN THE PARK: $9 for a 32oz. soda with unlimited refills. A large one is $5 and not as big, so if you get even two this is a great deal. On the hot day I was there we filled the sucker up three times and once more before we left. Well worth it.

In short, if you're doing the Spring Training thing definitely come to Peoria. It's super relaxed and one of the best places to enjoy some baseball. You will want to keep coming back!",1
"A hand-job with gardening gloves.....

I went looking for Scottsdale Auto Salon to get a hand wash tint quote on my new Mini today. Finding it out of business, I whipped out my handy-dandy Yelp iPhone app looking for a nearby alternate to at least get the wash done and found Classic Car Spa. 

Expecting to pay a bit more for a traditional hand wash I was surprised to find a machine assisted process. I'd spent way to long trying to locate the place (thank you Google maps) so I just opted for their supreme wash, which includes both interior and exterior detail.

My son and I watched the car move through the process and saw that at least the 'wash part' was done by hand, but they used the same mitts from the filthy truck that had gone through previously. -1 star

After seeing this, I should have watched their 'interior detail' more closely. When I got the car back there were lines of dirt in my white roof, and water spots on the accent chrome. When we got in the car there still bits of chip on the seat and floor mat from my sons spill the day, and it was obvious that the dash and interior hadn't been detailed. (Unless they refrain from using any product what so ever on the interior of the car. The dash and steering wheel were bone dry and dusty.)  - 1 star

I should have brought it up to someone, but my husbands' and sons' hunger won over and we just left. Thankfully all of their other locations are to far out of the way to bother detouring to again.

The staff was friendly, and their waiting area was pleasant with lots of drink choices, although I'm not sure their waiting area was comfy enough for anything longer than a wash.",0
I came here for a Yelp event and had a great time. They have the place somewhat divided into two sections- bar and restaurant. I liked that the patio opens right into the bar so you kind of have an extended bar. The food was really good and the staff rocked. I have been meaning to go back. I'll put that on my to-do list!,1
"My friend and I have been going to camelback spa for about 5 years for our birthdays. this past year we decided to try something new. We went to Desert Ridge Spa for a change of pace - man were we ever sorry we did. the facilites are not nearly as nice as Camelback, the food service sub par at best - while they did make it right - the fact that my friend ordered one thing and was given another and we complained to the waitress her response, was ""oh I was curious at which one of you got the wrong order"" Really?? you knew that and didn't come up to us? I asked for my burger medium and it came well done, I am glad I didnt wait for her to come back and ask how my food was cause it was 1/2 hour before she came back. I was parched for some water. Although they gave us our food for free - it was just inexcusable. Have had better massages at Massage Envy- will not be going back",0
"This awesome park and recreation center makes me wish we lived in Peoria. We were here today for a FRAG (reef tank geeks) picnic and the whole area is new and beautiful with lots of different amenities. We saw sand volleyball courts, a spashground (with critters spouting water) for the little kids, a skate park packed with older kids, picnic ramadas, fishing areas, baseball fields, batting cages, and a duck pond. There is even a Starbuck's.

We were at the group ramada BBQ pavilion, the likes of which I have never seen before. It was a huge covered circle of about a dozen BBQ grills with ventilation hoods hanging above and a cement ""bar"" from which to serve on the outside circle and smaller cement ""tables"" behind on which to do prep work. There were also sinks in the center to wash up. Surrounding this circle of grills were corresponding ramadas with picnic tables numbered for your group. What a fantastic set up! 

Great job, Peoria!",1
"Welcome to Downtown!  Finally a little area with a few great chains.  They also have PARKING!  The parking is located on the east or south side of the building.  We grabbed Jersey Mike's on a Sunday afternoon and took it home to eat.  They are the best subs we have had.  They are packed with meat and cheese.  Might be little pricier then blimpie, but with it due to the over load of meat!
 Check out a Jersey Mike's near you!",1
"Being from NJ I am always on the prowl for my hometown pizza and Italian food. They have absolutely the best cannolis like my grandmothers!  The pizza droops like Ray's Pizza in NY. I'm not a big fan of sauce that has any sugar in it which most do so to many their sauce is awesome. I prefer unsweetened everything.

The service is great and they are from New Jersey!  It's a great place to grab their special 2 slices and a coke for $4! YUM!",1
"HELLISH HELLISH SUMMER WEATHER (March thru October)
it hurts my lungs to breath.

I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay.
The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR, I don't drive, I don't even have a drivers license*!!
~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident,~*~*

I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education.
I graduated with a magna cum laude. I have attended other universities. However, I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.

For example, you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.

Business school was so and so, a lot of repetition.
Very little hands-on and help with internships.
Way too much groupwork and free-riding.
They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.

Oh, and professors rarely teach the courses.
They have their teaching assistants teach us.

Also, there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes.
 Junior year when you get admitted into the ""professional program"" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.

The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)

There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes.
The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.

Also, the classes don't teach you how to think critically, which I think is crucial in college.
Please don't waste your money, especially those of you from out of state. Its not worth it.

Expect to wait in line wherever you go.
ASU accepts way too many people.
It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.

Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need.
The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school.
They are not informed enough to advise you.

I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration.
I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.

Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007.
Gross!!

One thing I liked was the student theatre performances. The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.

The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.

ASU is not the most safe neighborhood.
I have been approached by many shady people.

do NOT live on campus. Especially the dorms on north campus.
They are beyond crappy and overpriced.
You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads.
The ""freshman year experience"" bullsh*t they pull on you, don't buy it.
and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).

I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats), unhealthy (mold, pot circulation), most promiscuous place on campus.

Again, please don't bother wasting your money, especially if your an out of state or international student. 
Hope this helps.",0
"One of my favorites. The crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meat,lettuce,cheese and always filling. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Also like Julios g  too next door for quick take out  or ""no Tip"" casual meal. Self serve chips and mild chunky salsa  are terrific.",1
"Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer. They have free air (for your tires) and water (for the radiator) at every location I've ever been to. Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, aren't TOO greasy and actually taste like food. The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does. QT frickin' rocks.

And BTW, the QT stands for Quick Trip.",1
Awesome!!!,1
"Scratch is an adorable little pastry shop on the corner of Miller and Indian School.  From what I gather, the owner is almost always in the shop behind the scenes creating the incredible dishes and pasteries I have come to love.  I have been to Scratch about four times now and have never had a bad experience.  The place itself is rather small, tucked away in a shopping center right next to a Subway, the home of the $5 footlong.  The decor is fresh and inviting from the pink/grey walls to the framed magazine covers stylishly displayed along the walls (the owner's wife is the model in many of them).  

But, enough about the building and decor.  The food is by far the highlight of the experience (as it should be).  I would recommend any of their sandwiches as the bread appears to be freshly baked daily with encrusted herbs.  Each dish comes with a side salad with the most amazing tangy rich dressing (I think I will have to purchase a bottle of the dressing next time I'm there).  I recently tried the asparagus soup which was deliciously creamy and rich.  The quiche I would also highly recommend.  I've ordered the lorraine as my entree on one occasion but have also sampled the spinach and goat cheese which was equally incredible.  (each menu item is really reasonable, I think $7.50 for soup/salad, and $8.00-$9.00 for most sandwich/salad and quiche combos).

Please, no matter what you do, even if you are so very full after eating a scrumptious lunch or dinner here, you MUST try one of their pasteries (even if taken to go).  I would highly recommend either the milk or dark chocolate tarte.  The fruit tarts also look amazing but I have had the hardest time trying anything but these amazing chocolate tarts.  They are well worth the $5.00.",1
"A trendy looking bar...in the airport, hmmm. Wait, in the Phoenix airport?!? No way, impossible, not a chance. These were all the things I assumed before I actually arrived at Barfly before my flight to Mexico a few weeks ago, and I could not have been more wrong.

I wish I was there longer and actually had a chance to sample some of their offered dishes, which honest to god sounded pretty decent. It's still the airport so plan on paying the awesome prices of $10 a beer etc but at least you can spend your pre-flight time drinking on a cozy leather couch watching tube rather than the alternative Fox Sports bar in every other terminal.",1
"The best example North Scottsdale has of traditional Phoenix sonoran mexican food.  Los Olivos restaurants have been around forever - at least since the '60's.  The food is great if not fancy, and the place is pretty free of gimmicks.  You can get your fix of cheese crisps (aka quesadillas for you CA transplants), deep fried tacos, chimichangas, combination plates with so much sauce and cheese you can't tell what's underneath but it all works together to taste so good.  Los Olivos still plops down the free chips and salsa right when you sit down so you're good an full when that combo plate comes and glad for it.  The atmosphere is more like a nice mexican diner than mexican cantina and service is solid. They often have mariachis playing on weekend nights.  Margaritas aren't great, but the beer is cold.  Don't bother with dessert.  Cheap eats for all the food, especially since you won't be hungry for another 24 hours.  If you're in North Scottsdale and in the mood for traditional Phoenix style mexican food, Los Olivos is a great choice.",0
"I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place, since it's on the way home from work. 

I finally got the chance to stop by yesterday. They've been open about a week now. They are located on the north west corner of Guadalupe & McClintock, between the pet food store and Panda Express. 

Super cute place, has a roll up/fold up door so the whole front of the building can be open, right onto their little patio. You can sit inside or outside! 

Tons of different flavors! I tried the Peanut Butter & Jelly & a mint/chocolate one. Both were very tasty. I ended up going with their chocolate yogurt with some peanut butter sauce, a Giradelli chocolate sauce and peanut butter cups. SO GOOD. A decent sized cup cost about $3.30. 

The girl who rang me up was super nice, and offered me up little sample cups. 

The only suggestion I have is to label the toppings. Yes, most all of them are self-explantory, but a lot of those candy bars look the same all chopped up! 

I will be back for sure!",1
"They don't serve food, they serve sex on a plate. At first glance the place looks like a hallway but it's really a flavor factory hidden away between two buildings no one cares about because those places don't have Pasty's. The service is fast , friendly, and the music is off the chain.  The food is not to be forgotten though, there are so many selections of Pasty variations that anyone with any craving will loose all control of there facial expressions. I only wish the place was bigger, there have been times when I've  had to wait for a space to open up but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  That time allowed me  to prepare myself for the nirvana inducing flavorgasm that is The Cornish Pasty Company.",1
"Food is great.  Really good deal, lots of tasty food for a great price.  My favorite combo is the Pulled Pork sandwich with side of Mac & Cheese & Coleslaw & Kool Aid.  Founded by former NFL & ASU Football player they know how to barbecue I truly recommend everyone trying it out.  The atmosphere is not that inviting yet the food is worth staying and will get you to come back I can guarantee,",1
"This restaurant is truely cultural experience in your mouth---Chinese, Mexican with a dash of Jamaican. Pollo Diablo is fab! Mom and Pop place with some true TLC that goes into the food. The beer and wine was a good selection as well! 

Way to Go!",1
"I really adore this place. They've got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very, very juicy. I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork. Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly. 

Last time I was in, I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now, probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant.

Do yourself the favor. If you're heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike, stop off here and enjoy a nice meal. They have good lunch specials around $7.50 for a full plate with meat, hummus, garlic sauce, pita, and tabouli. Mmmm!",1
"Originally came by to get a watering system for our chickens and ended up buying something for every member of our furry family! They have everything here for cats, dogs, small birds, rabbits, poultry, horses and more! The customer service was excellent, we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well. Both of the people working were concerned with taking their time to help us, not about making a sale, and will even special order some products for us if ever needed. We don't feed our dogs dry food anymore (they now eat raw instead), but when we did, these are the premium/healthiest brands we were buying at a much higher cost at other retailers.

The prices are low, the hours are convenient, the customer service was great, the products are healthy, and the selection was large for how small the shop is, what more could you ask for? Great first visit and we will definitely be coming back again!",1
"Can I review some of the people who go here? Because I know one idiot who would get 1 star.  (But the park still gets a 5)

One dude let his dog pee on me! And the little bugger was fast! He'd prance toward you, and before you knew it, his leg was up and piss was streaming out of his winky cannon! 

My friend was tinkled on multiple times; she wasn't able to jump out of the way very quickly since she was pregnant. Did the man say anything? Only that his dog was only nervous. Are you kidding me?

Alright, I got your number. In return, we very actively encouraged our Australian Shepherd to play with the little terrier. Why? Because the Aussie Shep becomes a drool monster at the dog park, and the little pissing terrier (who only likes to pee on people, not trees or anywhere else in the park) ended up DRIPPING the Aussie Shep's saliva. Sweet! (that was the only time we didn't feel guilty about her saliva marking other dogs).",1
I love this place.Their italian beef with hot peppers is a must. I have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as good.Their prices are as good as you can get. So if you're hungry stop in & get full!!,1
"best breakfeast downtown ... bar none ... it's far more ""healthy"" than I traditionally prefer but the place is beatiful, very cool and has an ADORABLE waitress ;) !!!!",1
"Let's see.....
89 cents at Taco Bell for a taco that has cheese like sprinkles on a cupcake, or a Baja soft taco that has FIVE pieces of tomato in it? 

YOU
MUST
BE
JOKING.

Compare your Baja soft taco to the picture sometime and feel free to yell at the counterperson. Yes this happened. Taco Bell should be sued for complete misprepresentation!!

MEANWHILE at Del Taco..... 

39 cents for a balanced taco with a decent amount of cheese and delicious medium (""Scorcho"") sauce --- THE CHOICE IS CLEAR. Plus the deluxe tacos are CHOCK FULL. I usually get 4 regular tacos and end with 2 deluxe ones.
I've had the double cheeseburger once, nothing impressive there. It wants to be an In 'n' Out Double-Double, but it falls short, like when you were a kid and wanted Levi's 505's for Christmas and end up getting Sears jeans.
Come for the cheap tacos and LOAD UP I SAY!
The burritos are OK too.",1
I'm addicted! Everyone there is so freakin nice. And Maui dogs are delicious.,1
Best happy hour in north Scottsdale! Get there early to beat the crowd. Amazing cuisine and atmosphere.,1
"Who doesn't love $3 well drinks? Relaxed, social, no frickin' paid seating!! Except that I was propositioned to "" Swing"" by some totally gross dude, I Lovd this place to start the evenings!!! Great cheap drinks.  What more do you need?",1
"Love.  It.  Awesome pulled pork, brisket, turkey.  The sides are really good, too.  I feel like it's somewhat expensive, but it's worth every bite, but then again, that's BBQ.  If it's dirt cheap, that means it's not quality meat.

Anyway, the 2-pound potato is great, too -- chives, sour cream, butter....",1
"I LOVE the pretzels! Wish they would bring back the Asiago Dip, but hey, garlic salt and cabs are 2 of my main food groups. Great atmosphere, can always see a game on one of the many TVs, even when my girlfriend thinks I'm paying attention to her! Milk stout is my favorite beer, but the light isn't bad either. Something tells me the others are good too, but it's hard to get me to stray from my patterns. Oh well, I'll leave someone else to review those. All in all, the food and beer is great, and the servers seem to know what they're doing too.",1
"Love love love this place.  Tasty with great prices... who can beat that?  My newest thing is to order a gyro-to-go and enjoy it at home.  I'm a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be. haha

See ya there!",1
"First I want to thank Hula for saving my date night.  We headed out for Postino Central for their wine and bruchetta special on a Tuesday and were disappointed to find out there was an hour wait.   So we headed up central looking for an alternative. I saw Hula and remembered I've wanted to try it for while, so that's where we ended up.  I started with a blood orange martini and sweet potato fries.  The martini was awesome, but I have to say the fries had potential, but they weren't crispy.  For dinner I had the Jamaican jerk tofu.  It was pretty flavorful and the corn cakes and plantains that came with it were a nice addition.   The meal was good, the service was great and the overall ambiance was chill yet urbane.  It wasn't the best place I've ever been, but I'll definitely go back. I love that there are several vegetarian options to choose from, so I'm eager to see how the other entrees turn out with tofu.",0
"AMC Esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new ""Dinner and a Movie"" blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate (that's right, I just referenced Blue Ocean Strategy, get over it).  No, it's not an extremely enlightened idea. I've been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger. Like ""Don't mind this $9 full meal over here, we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold."")

Yes, it's more expensive than a regular ticket. Almost double for the nice seats. But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS. You will regret not getting the $15 seats if you don't buy the $15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home. 

This theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable. I saw The Master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled Bacardi flask if I didn't have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it. I seriously won't go to a movie anywhere else and I guarantee you'll say the same once you go. FIVE STARS.",1
"This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech. 
They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!",1
"Dropped in today for the first time...and can I say it's worth the drive?

No attitude. No c*nty saleswomen like that OTHER PLACE THAT SHALL NOT BE MENTIONED.

Cashier, sales people and customers were all so darn friendly and helpful I don't know what to say other than...YAY! I'll drive the 20 miles here to get my dog the food he needs.

Buh-bye local business pet store that's closer to me and sells the same brand of food I buy for my dog...I'm a fan of the BEAST!",1
Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat. If you want to take your teenager out for a shake or ice cream you may enjoy it :),0
This place has the most AMAZING selection of cheeses. EVER. Boyfriend got me a tasting selection of about five different cheeses for my birthday last year and I was in heaven. Truly amazing variety and all were super yummy.,1
"Great white sangria and margaritas!!!  We went for dinner, but ended up ordering appetizers and a pitcher of white sangria. All I can say is the service was great but the drinks are amazing!!!  The tortilla chips  were fresh and homemade.  The ceviche was so tasteful!",1
"Seriously the best 3am quesadilla I have ever had.  It was big and gooey, with just enough browning on the outside of the tortilla to make it a little bit crisp.  As an added bonus it was kind of cold outside, so it made a great hand warmer as well.  Why only 3 stars?  OK, you do have to sit on some questionable outside picnic tables and I don't want to think about how clean the kitchen may or may not be, but the entertainment value of watching tipsy people stumble around while waiting for their food can't be beat.",0
"In being a bit of a burrito man, I was suspicious that a torta could ever marvel a tortilla filled with meat.  However, all of the hype on yelp and man vs. food was appropriate, as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork, turkey, guacamole, and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich.  The carne asada quesadilla blew us away-- HUGE in portion, amazing meat, and super flavorful.  I was also glad to be one of the few gringos in this place.  People were friendly toward us in any case.  Check out the horchata for some authentic aguas frescas...",1
"Best pizza Ive had in Arizona hands down. My best friend lives in AZ, my friends and I stopped by this place and enjoyed surprisingly wonderful tasting pizza a must try. When I went here they were playing underground hip-hop which I am a fan of. It made it a great atmosphere to enjoy my food. I highly recommend this place I live in California and this place still comes to mind. Great for college students and the fam bam.",1
"Last week was my third visit to NOCA.

Since it was a Thursday, I had the wagyu pastrami sliders.  They were very good.  Thick pieces of meat on nicely toasted bread.  House made chips were great on the side.

Good service.  Top-quality restaurant all around.",1
"This Target gets the job done. Their shelves tend to be in a little disarray, and their makeup selections are generally lacking, but other than superfluous purchases I didn't even need to make, this Target has never let me down.

The grocery section is probably the cleanest and best in the store. I love perusing these aisles.

Their clothing section is pretty diverse, but because the store is somewhat small, it's packed in tight. It's a challenge to maneuver the area.

The biggest perk is its central location to southern Tempe. It's also very rarely busy during the day, which is awesome!",1
Best corned beef sandwich I've had anywhere at anytime. Definitely great portions of food. The jewish sliders are very good especially with the potato pancakes. Too bad they aren't in California because I can see myself visiting this a lot.,1
"Yum, Jersey Mike's! I freakin' love their wheat bread with the little specks of... I don't know what it is but it's very good. The mini sandwich looks tiny when you first see only the bread but after it's decked out and rolled up, it becomes a plentiful sized sandwich. I've tried different sandwiches here... turkey, club (both kinds), italian and cheesesteak and love them all. There's something about that oil and vinegar they top it off with in the end that seals the deal. Other places do that too, but Idk here it just tastes better.

Sometimes I ask for the chipotle mayo instead of the regular and it's quite yummy with a little added spice. 

Also, I like that they carry Pepsi products. I like it better than Coke. And they have Cherry Pepsi, too  :)",1
"OK, Sweet Pea and I love us some Coup, and it's not just because we've been coming here for years- since I lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window- or because we got engaged here (which was incredible.)  It's because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  It's consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad.
As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentine's day which we've been several times and I highly recommend.  It's romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentine's Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentine's Day, they still have the menu, but it's cheaper.  Damn those greeting card ""holidays"".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for ""corking fees"", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle.
Coup, I love you.  You get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service.",1
"Went in on a Friday at about nine for a quick bite to eat. Far underdressed but I was welcomed warmly. Looked for a seat in the bar but it was jam packed, standing room only. Fortunately ran into some friends who let me sit at their table. Was greeted by a server after a few minutes and brought back drink and food menu. Ordered a la Paloma, NY strip medium and broccoli . I was promptly brought my drink, water and silverware. After just the right time my food was brought to me. I enjoyed my steak but my only negative was the plate it was brought on. The plate was so hot the moment it was set in front of me I could feel the heat radiating off of it. I did not enjoy eating my meal while sweating from the heat of the plate and being in fear of burning myself with any accidental touching of it. Not long after that some more friends showed up and we had a very nice 2005 Napa Cab. I didn't browse their wine list but if I do go back I am curious to what they have. Overall it was a nice experience, but I'm not sure I'll be going back anytime soon.",1
Had lunch here with Robyn N. and Rand H. the food here was ok and I liked it better before they did the so called renovation.All they did was add a mongolian BBQ and wash the windows. Some of my favorite things on the buffet were gone so I am dropping them down to 3 stars but still it was a good lunch.,0
"I was quite pleased when I visited Quick N Clean today. I opted for the $6 wash-- though now I can't quite remember what was included in said wash. I felt like it could have been a little bit more thorough in the rinse/dry section, as there was a trail of dirt coming off the back of my car.

HOWEVER-- be not dissuaded by the dirt on my bumper (as I wiped it off, and the rest of the car looked great) because the vacuums at this place? OH MY GOSH! I have never been to this kind of car wash and experienced such suction. They were also an ideal shape for getting into the tight spaces underneath my seats. 

Word to the wise: when you go to remove the hoses from their little canisters, pull with force. I stood there for a couple of moments as I attempted to gingerly remove it, and thought the hose was stuck. I soon realized that I looked like an idiot, and just gave the vacuum a tug, and it came right out. 

Overall, I definitely say thumbs up. I had been hoping for a little rag to wipe out the interior, but am not sure if the rag was part of one of the other packages, so I will investigate again, and let you know.",1
"I really didn't think this place was all that great.  None of the food that I ate was particularly very good.  I think the best thing I had were some sort of sweet and sour meatball things.  Everything was just hard, overcooked, or flavorless.  I wasn't really impressed with the options available either.

The saving grace of this place is the BBQ station and the sushi bar.  The bbq looked 1000 times better than YC's Mongolian freeze-dried junk.  The sushi was decent too.  This place is just middle of the road for me.  I can't blame it for having over-cooked food...it's a buffet.  But still, I've had better.",0
"I love this place. I sit in the bar and as one other reviewer noted, there is always someone interesting there to start up a conversation. The burgers are top dawg, the condiment bar allows me to fulfill my jalepeno quota, the wings are perfection, and the drinks are reasonable. 

When the weather is nice, grab a table outside. The service is a smidge slower, but the courtyard more than makes up for it. If the weather is warm settle in and enjoy whatever game they have playing (if you aren't seeing your team, just ask and they will happily turn at least one set for you).",1
"I've gotten lunch take out here a few times. The only thing I've tried is the drunken noodles. While I think they are pretty decent, I have been having serious issues getting the right spicy-nes. The first time I got them, I asked for level 3 spicy. Their spice meter goes from 0-5. I love love hot and spicy Thai food, however these noodles were practically inedible. Yet, they were so delicious at the same time I devoured the entire thing. And I felt like I was going to die later, as my stomach felt like a fishnet stocking...
The second time I ordered them I asked for level 2 spicy. This time they were not spicy at all. At all!! They were so bland. I mean, they still tasted good, but were missing that drunken noodle kick! So, at this point I don't know what to do. Obviously every cook there must have a different idea of what each number means. 
The last time I ordered from here, I simply said drunken noodles. I didn't specify a spicy level. I figured maybe this would give me the perfect in between spicy that I so desired! Well, when I got them, they were more bland than the level 2. And tasted kinda weird. 
I will give them another try as they are right across the street from my work, and I hope we can work out our spicy issues! 
4 stars for the service, they're really friendly here
2 stars for the food, until we can work out our issues
And 4 stars for the convenience!",0
"I feel the Days Inn Tempe is best described as ""a place where you can purchase the right to sleep for awhile."" 

I booked my 10-night stay on Travelocity for a non-smoking room, yet when I entered the room I almost choked. It was disgusting. I've never had a smoking hotel room before and I will make sure I don't again. They said they couldn't move us to a different room.

My local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew. No big deal, I thought to myself, as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew. Nope. Coors Light it is.

The towels felt like they were made of cow tongue, and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about $500.

I'm awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days, and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby. The dollar store had a corkscrew.",0
"The food's been covered before so all this review will be is further social proof that this place does indeed rock.

  I've missed good veal cannelloni for a while now , looks like I wont need to anymore:)    For once it's not the processed grey stuffing that has one texture throughout  surrounded by an inner tube ( Cough  famous chain)    Erin's  Pollo Piccata was excellent  and the accompanying pasta was perfect.

Sadly  they fed me too well since I was dying to try the tiramisu  but the afternoons plans didn't involve  refrigeration.  Lastly thanks to all that  saw the excellent reviews and kept piling them on it really makes a big difference on how likely we've been to try new places.",1
"I've been here a million times and usually have lunch at the bar.  This is the classic french brasserie style restaurant.  With a nod to Balthazar restaurant in NY's Soho this is a fun place.

This visit I sat at the bar and had the curry chicken sandwich on toasted sourdough.  I think that toasting the bread on any sandwich makes it better.  The sweet curry flavor make this sandwich a winner.

Sean may be the best bartender in Scottsdale.  He is always friendly and very efficient.

Definitely stop in here the next time you're at Kierland Commons.",1
"I cannot believe I am about to say this:
AIRPORT FOOD IS GOOD.

For any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis, you've surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks.  It doesn't matter how much you spend:  the bread is stale or soggy, meats are dry and tasteless, and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality.

I was just shocked when I visited the Roadhouse at Sky Harbor recently.  I had an hour before my flight so I ordered a Stella Artois and a french dip.  I wish I'd had a camera to catch my expression when I bit into my sandwich.  The bread was soft and warm.  The meat was tender and tasty.  The cheese was really good; no joke this was real cheese.  And HOT au jus?  

OMFG I almost freaked out it was so good!  I couldn't wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised I was.  She kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time.  AT AN AIRPORT?  Folks, this is the best kept secret at Sky Harbor.  I will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future, even if my gate is in another termial!!

This place is in the low B gates - try it and you won't regret it!",1
"I must be spoiled and realize that this is not a big grocery store. I tend to think the store is a good place in a pinch for Asian ingredients. Mostly, Chinese and Vietnamese products for those looking for Japanese products might have to go elsewhere. In a pinch it is great, hopefully with local support this store can improve.",0
"Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym, heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere, plenty of planned family events/pool parties. 

Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff.",1
"""You don't need no teeth to eat our meat""

Haha, what else needs to be said.

This place is a solid BBQ joint.  I'm from the southeast and I love pork BBQ.  I was raised on NC style (from southern VA) but I appreciate all BBQ's.  This place is pretty great.

It's inexpensive.  Decent customer service.  Cheap beer.  Very little fat/gristle in the pulled pork which is something I pay very close attention to.  

If you're looking for something quick, easy, inexpensive and delicious give this place a try.",1
"You like hotdogs?  Motor (thats me) says get in your Mommy's oldsmobuick and get over to TEDS!  AND you sissys that like ""sonoran"" style dogs talking smack about Teds, go back to Tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter.   This is old style, 4th of July chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers.  Makes my mouth water.  Ok so visualize and taste this in your mind.  First the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water.  The crispy ice berg lettuce, juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lover's dream.  Real good home made taste.   So now act you like you always do on the 4th of July and get an all beef hotdog.  First a warning.  You will crave their hotdogs after you eat em.  The crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth.  Add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup ""hot sauce"" and buddy you got yourself dilemma.  The dilemma you ask? Is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood!  Try the Italian for a spicy dog.  Don't start with me on the fries and onion rings.  Just make sure you wear your fat pants.  Motor out and going back for another dog.",1
"""We wanted to take you out for your last dinner...so we got to thinking 'what place has specials on a Tuesday?'..and I remembered Chompie's has a special..AND A FOOD CHALLENGE.""

And THAT is how I ended up at Chompie's on a Tuesday.  They were featured on TV (I think it's Man Vs. Food, but I'm not sure) bc of this food challenge of theirs.  On Tuesdays, they have a special - AYCE Jewish sliders & fries with the purchase of a beverage for $11.95.  (Keep in mind, a plate of 3 Jewish sliders + fries is $11.95.)

I was told the specialties here are sliders.  The sliders themselves are a decent size (I'd say maybe it's the same size as the tiny McD's burgers, but taller?).  Jewish sliders have potato cakes in them; Western sliders don't; breakfast sliders are something completely different.

Everything we ordered was ehhhh (befitting of a ""meh, I've experienced better"" rating).  Two things that did impress me, however, were:

1. They place pickles on the table right when you sit down!  I'm not a pickle girl myself, but it's a nice gesture.
2. Everyone here is so FRIENDLY (I mean genuinely friendly!!).  Idk, I think most Arizonians in general are friendlier than the Californians I encounter on a daily basis hahahhaa.  And our waitress went out of her way to split 5 checks for our party of 7...that was pretty cool of her.

I'm glad I went here for the experience, but I wouldn't come back again.  Lesson learned: Don't trust a bunch of post-gym, hungry, non-Yelping boys to pick a dinner spot ;)",0
"Icey iced ice... tasty and refreshing, Rita's delivers.  You can't help but smile as you walk in the door, anticipating the tasty goodness that is lined up in front of you.  They have simple cream ice, milkshakes, gelati, Italian ices, frozen custard, frozen custard cookies... and on and on. 

We stopped by on a random, warm afternoon after passing the new store and noticing the sign... a few samples later, we were sure that we'd found a winner.  My only 'ouch' came when I found out the calories and fat in my Blendini mix.  :-/  Glad I shared it!  We'll just make Rita's an occasional splurge.

Yum... Blendini!  We recommend the Vanilla custard with Toffee. :-D  

See ya there!",1
"I'm apparently not as big into Greek as some of the others have posted, but I can honestly say anyone who's given this place less than three stars probably just expected too much. I had the best Greek salad that I've ever had, and I will agree with one review that it was definitely too light on the feta. 

The service was great, food was excellent, and while it may have been a bit on the pricey side I felt as though it was a great value. Not one of the places I would take out-of-towners and rave about, but a great little spot to hit for lunch.",1
"everytime my sister comes to town we go striaght from the airport to Karsh's.
our intent is to buy bagels and we do, but we can never stop there and wind up with a variety of goodies. all that we have comsumed over the years has been really great. as for service, always with a smile and friendly attitude.
we used to go here all the time when we lived on n. central, but since we moved to the other side of the world it has become a special occasion place. so please open one near us too.",1
"I moved to AZ about five months ago and have had two tragically bad haircuts from two other ""salons."" 

I wear my hair in a short pixie cut and it's very hard to find someone with the skills to do it right so I don't  end up with a mans cut.

I found Epic Salon here on Yelp and decided to give it a try.

I could not be more pleased.  My appointment yesterday was with Chey and she's wonderful. 

I am very exacting when it comes to how I like my hair cut and am fluent in industry terms so I can articulate what I want.

Chey listened very well and understood what I wanted. She totally delivered. 

I am so very relieved to have found her.  And at $26 (cut only, no blow out) it's a real deal.",1
"When you walk in, it's dark and relaxing. The atmosphere is nice, quiet, with alot of dark wood highliting the place. The food is good, but be careful because the price can add up quickly. This will always be a restaurant I go to, with burgers and steaks and spinach dip. The best way to think of this place, is a lower grade of Houstons. It's almost there, but not quite.",0
The Corner Bakery was A-Ok! To me it seemed like an elevated Paradise/Panera. I had the Cobb Salad and it was perfectly chopped and dressed.  The desserts looked really good but a little on the pricey side for me to try that day. I'll be back because I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the great customer service.,1
"Haus Murphy's was my first German food experience ever. The cuisine was OK but it isn't something I'd shove people down to get to. 

I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphy's wasn't quite up to par. 

We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a ""sampler"", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I don't know for sure what types they were, but they didn't taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket. 

The sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which I'm told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants. 

For our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzel's came out and mine was the blandest. My friend's schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy ! 

No biggie, I'm a foodie so I'll eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I don't know if it's just Haus Murphy's, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy. 

I do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach). 

The beer here was good authentic German beer. I didn't get drunk, but I still don't remember what kind I had, you'll have to experiment. 

Service was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphy's was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer.

I ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt. 

To steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: ""That big ass pretzel made me thirsty""!  

Note* They don't actually have it on the menu as a BAP.

Would I return to Murphy's? Ehhh, yeah to try some of the other things, but I definitely can't see it as a place that I would be a regular at.",0

"In response to a recent thread about Boba drinks in CenPho, I said that Rainbow served at least 1 flavor- chai- which my husband found to be ""just ok."" When Hubby asked me this morning if I wanted to ""taste the Rainbow"" for breakfast, I asked him to check on the Boba situation. It turns out that Rainbow listened, and they now will add Boba to any of their drinks. The woman behind the counter said you can call ahead so you don't have to wait. Hubby's vanilla and my strawberry frap that he brought home today were still ""just ok."" The donuts are still really good, and they finally have some stable hours, 4 am to 8 pm.",1
"More like 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because the overall property was so nice.

Good Food, Good Service, Good View (overlooking the golf course).

I had the Chicken Caprese sandwich which was quite tasty, but the burger my mom has was WAY better.  If you go here.... order a burger.  They are big, juicy and super duper good.  It's also super duper messy.  It's a ""fork and knife"" type of burger. 

Their bloody mary is pretty good... a little too tomato-y.... needed more seasoning.

Mom's John Daly Peach drink was refreshing.  Good for cooling off and relaxing after a round of golf.  :)

Tater Tots were served with our sandwiches and they were good... but nothing all that special.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside... but for this type of establishment.... I would have expectetd Truffle Tots or something different.

Their relishes that they offered on the side were 'ok'..... I was not impressed.  They tasted like they were from a bottle.... I'm sure they make their own relish... I'm just saying they didn't taste any different than the ones you get at the store.",1
"Two weeks after I dropped off my computer for service with the Geek Squad I got it back with a new screen and hand rest.  They said 3 weeks and I got it in two!!!  And the open-box computer I purchased to use while mine was in the shop was returned with no problems. 

I was so happy we purchased a new Toshiba DVD player for $40. Who knew that DVD players could be so cheap?  I've been using it all day and it works beatifully.",1
"This was my first trip to Culver's and it came highly recommended. At my friends suggestion, I tried the butter burger deluxe, fried cheese curd and the.....I forgot what it was called, but the frozen custard - basically the equivalent of a DQ Blizzard.
The burger patties were paper thin (thus the reason I ordered the double), the lettuce was crisp, tomatoes fresh, bun soft and buttery. I thoroughly enjoyed my burger. Very flavorful!
I had never had fried cheese curd and had no idea what to expect. The closest thing I can think to compare these to would be mozzarella sticks. They are about the size of a grape, and full of salty cheesy goodness.
The custard was delicious! I had the vanilla with butterscotch and oreos (I ordered butterscotch and brownie pieces, but there was a mixup, but I had no complaints).
I really loved everything I had. The menu is big and I can't wait to go next time so I can try something new. 
The thing I didn't like was the bible verses all over the walls.
Seriously?? It's not that I am anti-religion or anything. I am Catholic, went to Brophy and go to church twice a year. I don't need it thrown in my face while trying to eat with my friends. take a tip from In and Out. Put them on the under side of your cups. Work on your subtlety Culver's.",1

"In town for our 5 year wedding anniversary.  Sushi is one of our favs, so, after doing some reading on Yelp, off we went to Sakana.

I must agree with many other Yelpers...the nigiri is fantastic!  Huge, tasty pieces of super fresh fish.  I'm craving it now as I'm writing this!  I'm so glad I read the reviews and ordered several items from the nigiri menu...it was fantastic.  

The rolls, while well priced, were a little disappointing.  Maybe it was just our selections, but nothing really jumped out at us...everything was pretty bland.  We asked our server for recommendations and everything was a California roll plus this or that.  Pretty blah.  Even the Mexican Caliente Roll was rather uneventful.

The service was awesome.  Everyone was friendly, efficient, well organized.  The atmosphere was rather mainstream, which was fine with me.  I did have to laugh, as the first song we heard when we sat down was a Pitbull song, which another reviewer bemoaned.  The volume wasn't offensive, so it really only served to make me laugh. 

The customer appreciation menu and Kirin beer special is genius.  So many customer appreciation menus are pretty sparse, but theirs is well fleshed out and offers a lot of options.  We each ordered Kirins while we waited for our table (we were told it would be 15-20 minutes, but it was maybe 5 minutes) and got 2 appetizers for 50 cents each.  Pretty cool.  (The scallop poppers were yummy.  The edemame was, well, edamame.  Not a huge serving, but what do you want for .50?)

All in all, a good dinner.  We know when we go for sushi that it's probably going to be a pricy night.  Not at Sakana...it was probably the best meal we had in Scottsdale at the very best price.  If we're back in town, we will definitely return.  I'll just get more creative in my roll selection...or maybe just stick with the nigiri :)  Yum!",1
"Take the whole family and get a nice table outside. The burgers are good, the fried zucchini is better and the the barbecue chicken is amazing...",1
Ok I'm very surprised by the reviews on here. I'm not one to want to write negative  reviews but our food was so bad I couldnt help myself. Maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy. Unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well. Thank God we had a groupon and didn't have to pay full price. Won't be ordering from here again. Disappointing :(,0
"we come here once every two months for date night.  the serivce is generally slow because these are students, but everyone is super nice and tries their best . luckily every issue we've had has been with confidence for the front of house stuff (speaking up, looking at you in the eyes) -- the food is always excellent  generally they don't always offer everything on the menu but it's generallty the cod or sole.   the filet is always fantastic.  desserts are yummy. really everything is good.  the price cannot be beat $15 for a 5 course meal.  don't expect to get a last minute reservation,  it's generally for a few weeks out.  we like this place and happily tell others about it every chance we get.",1
"I like the Bamboo Club, but it doesn't seem to bode well with purists. It is a very Americanized spin on Chinese food, with some dishes it works well and others not so much. 

I struggle with a fierce addiction to Panda Express so I refer to it from time to time, but I feel I'm justified this time. Bamboo Club is like a deluxe version of Panda Express. In fact, their best dish is also the orange chicken, only done much more tastefully than their greasy counterparts. 

It's a little overpriced considering what they are offering (semi-glorified mall food) but, all in all, not bad.",0
"Worst store in the chain - I agree with one poster that it's not crowded but it also is out of items more than any other store.  It also is so understaffed it's impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate, my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway.  I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer, the person looked right at me and said oh we don't carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susan's line is a Michaels only item.  I gave the woman the line name and said no we don't carry that I'm sure.  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer, Oh that must be brand new.  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we can't do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.  so I go up to pay, a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michael's card?  I say sure do and hand it to her.  Oh that's not a Michaels card ours are red.  I explain that it's a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist I'm there quite a bit.  She says I've never heard of that before.  Well it's a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.  My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words I'm not sure,  let me call the manager.  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.  They finally agree to try it and I'm finally out the door just 40 minutes later.  And that's not even the bad part!   I went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time, or custom mat colors are hard to get.   Each time I explain it's a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat.  they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow.  

I wouldn't shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at Power and McKellip's it's a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection.   It's well worth the drive and the cost of gas I live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store.  They have even  framed two other items while I'm still waiting for the Gateway store to cut a simple mat.",0
Good boutique hotel with nice amenities. Clean and contemporary I'd definitely stay here again!,1
"This is a difficult review to write.  My family started eating here when they first opened. We were a once a week customer. Very happy with the food and service, pizza is delicious. 
Then one evening, we placed our order asking for the special we always get, a 2 pizza deal.
When we received our order, they placed 2 medium pizzas on our table. I immediately asked about the pizza size as we had always received 2 large pizzas as advertised.  It turns out they have 2 specials, a 2 medium pizza deal and a 2 large pizza deal.
The employee never asked which deal and the fact that we were there with 5 people should have prompted them to ask me to specify which deal.
I spoke to the owner of this location he agreed to make us another medium pizza to make up the size difference to which I agreed to.
Nearly 10 minutes later, the owner came to our table and told us that if he made us another pizza, he was going to have to charge us for it.
I refused and now nearly 2 years later, we have chosen not to return to this establishment. 
My money is important to me and it should be as important to any business, especially a small local business...
I now choose a place slightly further away, but one that appreciates its customers.
Pizza - delicious
Customer appreciation - needs improvement
Hope some changes have been made over the last couple of years",0
"Would have been 4 stats based on prior visit. This past visit the service was just garbage. Not the servers fault, she should have never been on the floor in the first place. Pretty annoyed that she had to ask other servers for assistance while taking our order. What's the soup? I don't know, Jim what's the soup? Is there cheese on the French dip. I don't know? Karen is there cheese on the French dip? The food has always been great and we will be back. Hopefully I can give them 4 stars next visit? Oh yeah, love the.new location!",0
"I'm from the East coast, so living in Arizona feels like living in the land that Chinese food forgot. George and Son's offers the closest thing to ""Chinese"" food that I have found in Arizona (yes I know this isn't real Chinese cuisine, just look at my picture). PF Changs is not Chinese food, and that is the best I have eaten before I came here. All the other Chinese food that I have found is full of MSG, and makes me sick.

The restaurant is cozy and relaxing, and the staff is very attentive. The sesame chicken is very good. I recommend asking for firecracker chicken. It is not on the menu, just ask for the firecracker pork, but with chicken. It has the right kick to it. I would NOT recommend the orange peal chicken. After eating 1/2 of my plate, I wan't to swear off anything orange for a month. I guess I needed something less sweet with a more varying taste. 

Last time I went in, I had the three amigos, which was very good. This is shrimp, chicken, and beef in a brown sauce, poured over a hot skillet plate at your table. I would recommend any of the three I mentioned.",1
"HUGE fan!

Love Poncho, the birthday strobe lights, the food and the service. 

This is a go-to for my boyfriend and I when we're looking for sushi. More likely than not, we'll opt for the all you can eat option for $20/ person. 

With that comes with miso soup, salad, sashimi, your AYCE picks, ice cream and with a special frequent customer request, this awesome pan seared, naturally fatty sea bass belly and salmon cheeks, which are AMAZING. Not a taste for everyone, kinda bizarre for most. But this will be well appreciated by traditional Asian taste and PERFECT for me. Loyalist here.",1
"Another great Fox concept!  So glad he opened something in downtown Phoenix!

I hosted a large group dinner in the back room and we had an amazing experience.  The service was phenomenal - they even took multiple photos of our group on 2 different occasions.  

The set menu was fantastic.  I really felt like we got a taste of what the restaurant had to offer.  I highly recommend the beet and apple salad, the crab stuffed chicken and the salted caramel pudding or blueberry cheesecake - absolutely delicious!

I went back a few days later for lunch and wasn't disappointed.  I enjoyed the sweet potato tortelli - it was melt in your mouth good!",1
"A very tasty place for breakfast.  I strenuously object to any place that doesn't serve hash browns, but really that's my only complaint.  They have a ton of different omelets/scrambles (you choose) and you can make your own.  Example: spinach tomato sausage bacon with american cheese.  As a scramble.  With salsa.  The coffee is good (I hear from my wife) and the cinnamon roll is a real treat.  Not the best cinnamon roll ever in a million years but a good 8.5/10.  

It is true that there can be a very long wait so plan ahead for sure.  You'll be waiting outside.  

They grill their wheat toast-solid.",1
"We just moved to town and were looking for a place exactly like this.  This bar is not posh, it is not shiny or pretty, it doesn't have a huge menu... and that is all fine by me.  

What it does have is a friendly wait staff, plenty of seating, good/ok live music, and a great bar selection.  

The mix of people that was there the night we stopped in was entertaining... I can't really comment on that, as I still think everyone here in Phoenix is crazy... lol.  

Either way, it seems to have that good old suburban bar feel to it, which is nice and cozy when you don't feel like dolling yourself up and having a fancy night out.",1
"Service was great, and always an interesting time on a late Saturday night.",0
"House of Tricks is a great place for dinner if you're looking to go out for a special occasion. It's not somewhere I'd go on any given night, seeing as how the bill is about $100 for a dinner for two. 

I appreciated the menu having a good deal of seafood on it, as I don't eat any red meat. We had the scallops as an app. - while the serving was small (as expected), the scallops were the prettiest ones I have ever seen! For dinner I had the ahi tuna - it was WAY bigger than I expected, I couldn't even finish it - but my date didn't hesitate to finish it for me. 

We sat outside as the sun was setting. The atmosphere was pretty much perfect except for one thing. We were seating next to the concrete wall separating the restaurant from the street. If you're sitting at the tables next to the wall, I'd say it comes up to your elbows. Anyway, there were ants crawling all over the wall and it made me kind of uncomfortable and itchy. 

Our server was a young guy who could have washed his shirt a few times before wearing it again. Otherwise, he was pretty cool - sort of a 'no sense of urgency' kind of server - but we weren't in too much of a hurry anyway.",1
"Lost 2 stars!  Sat in the restaurant for 15 minutes ... no waitress ... no water ... no nothing.  We left.

Sad part was there was people who left, then came back and got service before us.  The guy who came in after us got seated, hot tea and his order taken while we just sat and waited.  SERIOUSLY doubt we will be going back now.  If you have an hour or so to kill, you can wait for your food/service in there.",0
"First off, it's fast Chinese, and they lived up to their promise on that one, we did get our dinners fast. I am a huge fried rice fan; and I have to say theirs was horrible, stick to plain white or brown rice. However, I had the beef with broccoli and that was ok. It's not like Beef with broccoli is exploding with flavor anyways, so I can confidently say they didn't mess it up. What I do like about this place (besides how quick our food came out) is that you can do the meal deal , typically only offered at lunch, for dinner which gets you the egg roll and crab puff at dinner. I love crab puffs, again theirs was just ok and I didn't care for the egg roll all that much. Overall it was fast, filled me up with a huge portion that I took home lots of left overs; they were open kind of late - until 10, and it wasn't the worse thing I ever ate. Also, they had very friendly service.",0
"I'm glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  I'm not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out. 

Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didn't taste one that I didn't like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!  

$10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.  

It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!  

Will I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!",1
"This ice has the abilty to make you feel COLD on a 100+ degree day - I am hooked on the Key Lime, Alex's Lemonade, and Florida Orange. Very nice staff, friendly and free samples ....",1
"First off, I am not a science person. Unless social sciences counts, in which case, I have a bachelors degree. My boyfriend on the other hand was raised by two Phd holding physicists and studied electrical engineering in college. He has weird accelerometer-type machines in his garage and has conversations that would make the cast of the Big Bang Theory proud. Kudos to the Arizona Science Center for offering exhibits that appealed to the both of us.

We started on the 4th floor at the Solarville exhibit which focused on energy, the environment, and conservation. It talked about individual household energy usage, and ways to reduce environmental impact. The 3rd floor had the Forces of Nature and Technology exhibits, which both offered interactive and informative displays. The 2nd floor was all about electricity, so naturally my electrical engineer bf showed off his knowledge. The coolest part of the museum for me was the first floor at the ""All About Me"" exhibit. It covers the systems of the human body and even has a stomach you can walk through and a giant nose that blows out objects. The neuroscience portion was very interesting, and I enjoyed taking the interactive memory tests.

Admission was $14, not including special exhibits or films. We had a limited amount of time and didn't get to check out any of the extras (IMAX film, planetarium, pirate exhibit). We saw almost all of the museum in 2 and half hours. We were there in the early afternoon on a weekday, and it seemed like most of the school groups had cleared out by then.

Will definitely be back, perhaps for the Adults Night Out. Nothing against kids, but I can only handle so many middle schoolers at time before I want to scream.",1
"I WISH I LIVED IN SCOTTSDALE. I stopped by Yogurtland because I went to Spring Training, and I wish I could have stayed forever. The quality of the frozen yogurt is impeccable. So many flavors! I mixed Raspberry Cheesecake with Vanilla Bean, also tried the PB&J flavor (um, YES!?), Tangerine Tango, and my usual go-to, Tart. Very extensive toppings bar. Good price as well, I just love froyo. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, this will be one of the first places I go to!",1
"Food is whatevers, drinks the same. However, this DnB compared to the one in Tempe is much better if your'e really just interested in getting some game time in. The on at Tempe Marketplace is crazy busy, like 11 people waiting in line to play basketball crazy. When I go to an arcade and am already dropping 20+ bucks to play games I want that gaming experience to be nonstop. However, the drive is really far for someone that lives in Gilbert... so that's really the only reason why it gets a 4 star.",1
"Had to update because we've now tried the pizza! For all the times we have visited we've never tried a pizza (too many other really good options to choose I guess...)

We ordered the Italian Classic (veggies & meat). We ordered it a little well done/crispy and were not disappointed! It was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly! 

Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time!

We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans, potatoes, two eggs and fresh warm tortillas.  It was fantastic! This dish, just like many others (possibly ALL others) is plenty for 2 to share. 

Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day!",1
"Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!",0
"While my visit, to pick up take out was kind of drunken blur, the amazing food I ate from Diamond's after a few hours of harder than intended  drinking were JUST what the doctor ordered. My buddy did all the ordering, so all of it was a surprise, when I sat down to eat.  Quite possibly the best Hot-and-Sour soup I've had IN MY LIFE, and all of the everything else that was ordered, was smack yo' mama good. The fried rice, and lo-mein were divine (especially cuz it was a big diet cheat for me) and the EGG FOO YUNG = EGG FOO YUM. I've had much more bad Egg Foo Yung than I have had good Egg Foo Yung.. to the point that I never think to order it, cuz it usually SUCKS, but SO NOT THE CASE at Diamond's! The lady at the register = super cute, and I kinda like the ""stab joint"" classic chinese restaurant looks of this place.. no windows! YES! :D Five stars... the food seriously speaks for itself.",1
"I am beginning to be hooked on sushi.  Two years ago, I would have told you that sushi was just wrong....but now I am wrong :)

I went to Sushi Eye on Friday with my wonderful and lovely friend. (You know who you are) I was excited to go there, especially with the rave reviews.  At first I was a little put off since I thought that our server was a little bit of a moron with a splash of attitude.  I ordered an iced tea and before it took her over ten minutes to come back so I could get some pink packets to sweeten it up.  (And that tea was dark!)

After that little slip, everything was perfect...(though my miso soup didn't have any seaweed in it...which is odd in my book)  I had the Spicy Scallop and the Philly Roll...both were awesome!  And my friend's California Roll with Asparagus was the best.  I will have to order that next time for sure.

The sushi chef was very nice and the other server there was more attentive.  I loved the menu and it had a lot to offer.  (And since I am don't know a lot of my sushi yet, I liked it that they had descriptions)  The place was clean and I really liked the layout.  I will have to go there again and have some sake as well. :)",1
"This place is more miss than hit, I stop by here for breakfast on rare occasions and the food usually comes out more than slightly mangled.  

The food is usually edible and the customer service at the window is always friendly.  I've never had the experiences that Phoenician C has but I will admit that this can be one of the lower end McD's that I've been to in this town.

Curse you McGriddle!!!",0
"Angel Sweet Gelato is a welcome treat on a hot day. It sits in a small strip in the middle of Mesa Riverview, but if you can find it (west of Logan's), it's worth a stop.

The selection of flavors is large, including a dozen dairy-free fruit flavors that aren't quite as decadent as the dairy gelatos in the left-hand case. I've tried the lemon and all the berry flavors, and haven't found anything that wasn't delicious. The prices are reasonable, and you can order sizes from one small scoop to a big box (all unfortunately served in styrofoam).

There isn't a lot of seating in Angel Sweet, but I've never seen it full. Get a punch card if you live in the area. If you like firemen, this would be a good place to see them hanging out.  =)",1
"Based off of these great reviews i decided to give Z's Greek Restaurant a try. From my experience I give this restaurant an overall four stars derived by their Greek styled atmosphere, great food selection, and customer satisfaction! Z's is a family friendly zone which is good for all ages from kids to adults. There is barely any waiting line plus, the food is dished out quick. Best of all, there is a drive through window which allows easier pickup especially on the go. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never experienced Greek food and is willing to taste a different styled recipe from their original comfort zone. Everything is prepared tenderly, juicy, and well seasoned! Give Z's Greek a try!",1
"Went to the Rooste for a Christmas Eve dinner among a small group (9) friends. I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe. 

Been intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. That's all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. It's not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet. 

You pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring. 
First stop the bar. It's a limited full bar and for this it losses a star. 
From the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldn't book 'em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know you're welcome in your jeans. 

Moments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed. 

Our waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time I'll reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20. 

While waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if we'd like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic. 

The food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didn't hold it's heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idaho's (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice. 

All in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah I'm a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal. 

I highly recommend Rustlers Rooste.",1
"Beautiful Casino. I'm into architect. Yet, if you are a slot machine gambler for the fun of it or not. This may not be a place I would dump my hard earnings into even if it where just for fun. I was out her with my Uncle and although I didn't play. He was having a good time playing 2.5 hours straight. Yet, as I followed in from one slot to another after spending a lot of his money down the drain. I noticed that not only did he not get any winnings, but no one around was winning either during the entire time he played. Really?!?! Not only was he in the hole, but many others. Very ODD that I noticed this. Also, no one was working the floor asking anyone if they'd like a drink. Perhaps, I may be used to how Vegas does it?

I'm curious for other feedback from other attendees at this place. Have you had any winnings? 

We initially came out her for the Vietnamese Concert and Show. I would provide a rating for that, yet it's not a regular performance at this Casino. So I will refrain.",0
"This by far has to be the best Filiberto's location. I have been to the Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler, Prescott, Mesa, Gilbert, Tucson and Casa Grande locations. 

-Clean salsa bar with chunky and smooth salsa options.
-Free chips, most places will charge you for a small order.
-Gold Peak green tea!
-Smoothies and juices
-Video games, tv's and free wifi
-Fruit filled churros 

The tortillas are fresh and the place was actually clean, shocking. For what it is, this is a good location to stop by at if you are in the mood for this type of mexican food.",1
The server could have been better. She spilled a coke on my lap. This made me late for my movie. The wait was so-so however the food was cooked to my liking. I will go back.,0
"I love this restaurant. Very cheap, very clean, the food is sooo good. My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks, sometimes twice once a week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The environment is very comforting. I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food.",1
"Pleasant, courteous,  low prices and your clothes are ready the next day! What more could you ask for!",1
"These guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out. Great decor and hot, hot waitresses. 

We had lunch and it was pretty quiet. Good service. I'm sure things get crazy at night, though!",1
"This is simply a poor substitute for the Los Dos Molinos in South Phoenix.  It is a pale shade of itself.  The salsa is spicy, but it doesn't have any of the same excitement.  I think its partly the downtown location in a strip mall, (not that 98% of restaurants in Phoenix aren't in strip malls).  But the Mexcian Pizza and Chicken enchiladas just didn't have the same loving kick and spice.  When you are craving Mexican downtown, this'll do in a pinch.  But make room and time to head out to the original deal, the one with 5 alarm salsa and huge patios.  Margaritas the size of one's head and bring a group of friends to indulge!",0
The veg burger is fantastic - make sure you ask to try all the different aioli sauces especially with the tots!,0
"Can i just say, i hate everything about this store. If youre too lazy to go to goodwill and dig it out yourself for a third of the price, then i guess this is the place for you.  

If you are trying to sell anything, good luck.  Their askew sense of fashion will make most of your goods obsolete unless its tacky 80's regurgitation.  The chick actually told me that the band t-shirts i was trying to pawn were too outdated while i had a bay city rollers  and rockos modern life shirt in my hand off their rack.

They are incredibly overpriced, the staff has an elitist air for some reason (which you think would be hard to pull off in a tutu, leggings, and cowboy boots).

Saving grace, they have some killer old punk and skateboarding t-shirts on the cheap for guys and gals. But the only time i even go here is when the boyfriend decides to go thru eastside records vinyl catalog in its entirity. 

its like a plato's closet for lady gaga.",0
"This review is for the food only.  If you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that aren't food related you'll have to check out another review.

I love LGO.  The food is absolutely top notch and I love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things you've never heard of like their Venice Beach Burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs, tofu chorizo, spinach, and other goodies.  It comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic.  I eat breakfast here all the time and I have never been disappointed.  Also, if you're in a hurry grab one of their pre-made granola/yogurt/fruit parfaits, Yum!",1
We ate there last night and were very pleased our meals and service.  The ribs were especially good.  We would go back again.,1
"This place is pure crap! The players are sub-par and un-entertaining,  (especially Mike Clement and Julie Martinez).  , and the door men are ridiculously cheesy, and rude. 
I'm a regular at piano bars all over the country when I'm traveling (Pete's Piano Bar in Austin, Howl At The Moon in Scottsdale) and The Big Bang in Tempe is a terrible destination. Save your tips and bar $ for the aforementioned places and take my word for it.",0
"Bring a flashlight. It is so dark inside you can not read the menu. But the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations. 

We all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate. They recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag.

The wine list is extensive and expensive.  If you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating . 

Great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint .",1
"I was seated at the bar. A very nice young man was working the bar an provided good conversation.

I was offered a DELICIOUS chicken, bacon, bleu cheese amuse. Yum!

I ordered a pine nut pesto pizza, which wad delivered by the chef! :)

The crust was perfect! Thick enough for structure and substance, but thin enough to ""hide"" behind the flavors of tomato and pine nut pesto.
The cheese was also just right.

Delicious!

I also had the chicken panini, which was fantastic! The bread was a bit hard, but I think I was too busy talking and let it sit too long.

All in all I'd definitely recommend L'Academie if you're in that area of Scottsdale.",1
"From my door, it's a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.

Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on ""special.""

The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from ""freezer to fryer"" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.

One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons ""how is everything?"" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.

In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen. I'd rather go elsewhere.",0
"That's Amore is awesome! I'm glad to see that a nice, clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized. It deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor. It's a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot.",1
"Basicly i would let anyone know i like it, never heard a wiper of a bad experience here.  

Def a fan, i work very close by and if i really need they would deliver, yeah their that nice.  
How can i put it Ladybug House of Sandwiches or Sandwich shop for short what a great place in phoenix to take care of the lunch fill with out going to Subway, (not saying i don't go there).  
When I need a real sandwich I stop in here.  

They are a lunch spot so they close early and will have specail summer time hours.  

Why ladybug house of sandwiches well, great meats choice of differnt breads and its like what I love the ladybug theme.  and just what you think of ladybugs their nice not pests, pretty and would make a cool friend.  
Small note, i put my business card in their bowl once and actually won!  I got half off for the whole office, thanks ladybug ladies your the best.  

Once again Kevin, lets you know whats real, kind of like me

"I saw this place on a Food Network series in November. When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training, I knew we had to stop here. It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car. It was in a sketchy area in the town, and far enough from the freeway. When we were there, the workers gave us samples of the different foods. I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo. The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor, and the jade red chicken was also very good. The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy, which was a good thing for me. This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips.",1
"This place seems to get better every time I visit. The first time was a Friday night out with the guys. We met up for dinner and I had (and loved) the pulled pork and sweet potato fries. After dinne we got our drink on with a live band. The waitress was helpful in getting us drunk off a variety of liquors. And the shots kept on coming! It was a blast. The second time was more laid back, just grabbing a beer with a girlfriend. It was a Tuesday and the place was pretty busy. The next time me and the girlfriend showed up completely wasted and they had an Irish band playing. It was a perfect way to end our night after clubbing at the gay bar! We had a baileys nightcap and everything went dark from there. Awesome night!",1
"As I mentioned in my previous review, Maizie's was my favorite spot with the first Urban Wine Walk.  So it makes perfect sense that if the UWW Returns, so do I.  Well, return to Maizie's that is!  We started there this time and enjoyed all three wines they were tasting.  Their pizza and bruschetta bites were great.  And after we quickly inhaled the samples, we decided to get more food.  

The menu is pretty huge and everything sounded and looked delicious.  Yes, we were eyeing everybody else's plate as well; the bar seats are good for that!  After ooh-ing and ah-ing over what we saw, we decided to split the spinach and artichoke dip that came with chips and pit bread.  It was great!

The best part about Maizie's is that they just seem to do things right.  Friendly, casual service so you feel like you're among friends.  All sorts of specials listed up on the boards so 1) you don't have to feel dumb asking and 2) you don't have to feel even dumber when you forget and have to ask again.  Beer of the month (always fun to try), 20% off beer or wine to-go (what is this, Vegas?), happy hour specials (you had me at ""daily""), the list goes on and on.

Good food, great energy, small, cozy inside and an nice patio space too.  I have only been twice now, but have have fabulous experiences each time.  A few more times, and they win the fifth star, easy!!",1
"if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasn't awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a ""Rock"" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe.",0
"My wife and I were looking for a dinette table. We looked at many places and ended up at the RoomStore. We found a great table and decided to purchase the item. 

The salesman was nice and didn't provide too much pressure. 

There is a LARGE selection of items-couches, tables, chairs, dressers etc.

My problem was that we bought the table and had a deferred pickup due to moving into a new home several weeks down the road. I placed a small down payment to reserve my item. After several weeks, I contacted the RoomStore to pick up my item since I just moved into my new home. My item was not in stock and was told to call back later in the week. I called 4 days later and was informed the item was now available. 

Today, I went to pay the balance of my purchase and take home the table. Small problem, the table and chairs are not at this location.  I was given the choice to pick up the item at the distribution center 30 minutes away or wait until until Tuesday. I wish that during my several contacts during this process that someone would have told me that I wouldn't be able to pick up my item here or wait several other days. I was not happy! Now I have to go back once again to pick up the table and chairs.",0
"We stumbled upon this little place in a worn strip mall by accident, but it ended up being a very happy accident. 

Yes, it is true that the decor will not be gracing the pages of fashion magazines anytime soon, but this is a clean, no-frills kind of place. There is also no point in coming here if you are pressed for time, because it is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination. Most importantly, the food is good. Really good. 

The menus must have changed since other reviewers visited, because there was no Arabic on the menu. Everything is in English. I had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice. Both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that I have had at Fattoush many times- but this one was so much better. The falafel plate came with falafel of course, a questionable salad, pita that looked homemade, and some of the tastiest hummus i've ever had. It was a huge amount of food, but it was so good that I was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers. The lamb was apparently very tasty also- i'm not much of a lamb fan, so I didn't try it. The accompanying rice was very tasty though- very complex with many different flavors, but none of them were overwhelming. 

At 7.99 for the falafel and 9.99 for the lamb plate, the prices are more than reasonable, especially when you consider that each entree can easily end up being two meals. 

I admit that I am partial to Middle-Eastern food and rarely meet a falafel that I dislike, but this was definitely one of the better examples of the cuisine in the metro Phoenix area. I will definitely be back, and maybe next time i'll try the chicken.",1
"This little taco shop gets 5+ stars! 

The fish tacos were out of this world, breaded and fried to perfection. I also tried the al pastor taco that was marinated well and you can taste the marinade in every bite. I also tried molotes for the first time. The cilantro salsa and red salsa was homemade and oh so good and spicy. The quesadillas are like cheese crisps. I am so disappointed that I did not find this place earlier since it's so close to home. 

I have to try the other items in their menu soon. Price is very reasonable as their tacos range from $1-$1.50.",1
"It's true, there is a real bull and a slide. This place has been around forever, I think my parents used to go there back in the 70's. 

I can't say much about the food since I've only been here for happy hour, which was pretty decent. Their HH  included top shelf for 3 bucks and some cheap beers. They also have appetizers on the HH menu, sliders, quesadillas and potato skins, that sort of stuff.

Pretty nice view and going during happy hour you can see all the people sitting in traffic on the 10 and cheers them from the balcony.",0
"If you are a beer snob, stay at home trying to make it yourself.  If you enjoy a decent local beer in an old chandler building with a nice atmosphere give this place a shot.  The owner used to be a brew-master at Four Peaks Brewery which is a local favorite in Tempe.  

I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.    

The food is always good.  It is a bar so don't expect 5 star cuisine.  The fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well.  I haven't been disappointed with a meal yet.  Even when busy service is decent.  Enjoy the beer, watch the game and let it all unfold.",1
"I am a shoe addict.  I also appreciate a good bargain.  Whenever I am bored and have a little time on my hands, I like to take a walk through DSW.  I think it is kind of like playing ""dress up"".  You can try on anything and everything.  Such fun!  This location is one of the better ones I have visited.  It is well-organized, and the stock turns over regularly.  It is one of those hit or miss places - I will either leave with nothing or with an obnoxious amount of new footwear.  You just never know.  It has a fairly large clearance section as well - if you have the patience to look, bargains can often be found.  Definitely sign up for their rewards program - you will receive coupons regularly - yay! 

Happy hunting!",1
"I dream about their chopped salad...I, too, would use it as my screen saver if I didn't share a computer.",1
"This goodwill is Alright, I have been to better. Their selection is okay, cleanliness is okay and organization is okay. All goodwill's prices are the same, as far as I know. The staff is helpful and I never have trouble finding somebody if I need help.",0
"I was very impressed by their website and their services, and setting up my files for my cards was super easy and straightforward. I ordered samples before my cards...three weeks ago.

Haven't received anything yet. Now I know that the turnaround time on cards is between 12-14 days, but I didn't receive any confirmation that they'd been shipped, or what method they were being shipped through. Luckily I was able to call them and talk to people who straightened everything out, but I really get a strong feeling that they're a very small company that's still trying to learn the ropes.

The biggest problem I had was that my shipping and billing addresses are different. There's a box where you type in your shipping address, then it takes you to the billing section. When I got my order confirmation, I noticed that my billing address and shipping address were listed as the same at the top of the order, then lower down in the order section was where I had typed in my correct shipping address, yet it was partially cut off. I called them about it and they assured me that it was shipping to the correct address, however once I called UPS and had them reassure me that my cards were coming to the correct address, I received another email from Taste saying that the reason my samples weren't delivered was because I didn't give them the correct address. I looked back at my confirmation receipt and the correct address was typed into the bottom of my order. It was a matter of not paying attention I guess.

Suggestions would be to either pay closer attention to their customers entire order, or to work on the billing/shipping page instead of leaving it as a box to type words in, especially if it's not going to be read.

Pros are that they get back to you very quickly and make sure that your custom order is correct for print.
Cons seem to be the shipping and customer care portion.

Will I order from them again? Possibly. But my trust has definitely been tested.",0
Cholla Trail is a lot of fun and moderate hike. Echo Canyone is a lot of fun but also more challenging. Overall both trails are so much fun and a great workout.,1
I went there for happy hour.  The chips and salsa were good.  I was a little disappointed in the service.  We had to ask for everything.  I sat there with an empty glass for quite some time.  The bartender could have been having an off night so I will give them a try again.,0
"Was not satisfied first trip, service was awful and place was deafening.  But we thought food was worth trying again.  So, now that the place has been open and matured it is much better.  Our sever was good, the place was about 1/2 empty which made the noise level much more bearable.
Food, very good.  Not chicago family run good, but for the valley very good.
I asked for my shrimp to be spicy and it was.  Hsb can't handle so hot and his curried duck was mild as requested.  The mustard wraps, unusual and tasty.  Hsb loved the peanut sauce.  Chicken and lemongrass salad, good flavors.  We will be back.",1
I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.,0
"Went in to pick up lunch. I ordered the bean & cheese burrito (per Yelpers recommendation).
It took a LONG time for my order to be ready, next time I will definitely call ahead. The price was awesome and the food was really good. 
I anxious to try more items on the menu!",1
"love. Love. LOVE.

How can you not fall in love with this store the moment you walk in is beyond me. It's like entering that magical fairy tale land your mind goes to every time I start to sing or sit down at my piano. And that's exactly what a music store should be. It should bring you to that creative center where the outside world doesn't exist. 

First and foremost, the staff is extremely friendly, both on the phone and in person. I've spent I don't know how much of their time having them assist me in finding sheet music and they've always been a gem and even gone so far as to go google searches for me while I was there and give me some additional leads. It's just an awesome amazing experience. 

They also never seem to mind me going in and gawking at instruments for hours on end. I always tell myself someday I am going to learn a new instrument, and going in there causes me to think of at least 10 I want to play... especially when I stare at the drums.

Go to Milano and experience what a music store is supposed to be.",1
"I do love rum and should review the Rum Bar separately but both the Rum Bar and the Breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome! 

Great recommendations from the waiter... Brown Stew Chicken and Jerk Chicken are really good... really spicy on the jerk chicken but thats somewhat expected and perfect for me! I'll take my plantains baked over fried any day! SO GOOD! Really great place to go for not so typical food! 

The entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way.  Their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu, environment and service, which is rare to see in restaurant employees. Not to mention a perfect location ... very walkable to other nearby bars and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix!",1
"Id say 3 stars but since the have menudo everyday and prepare it at order I'll go 4. Street tacos are good so is the carne asada.  Typical gringo ""Mexican"" food.",1
"I'm giving Yoli's 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location.

Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.  Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.  I ordered the Morning Monte.  It was delicious.  My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others' plates and everything was excellent.  My favorite item was the chorizo burro.  Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.  The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also.

Another really great thing about this place is the prices.  I don't think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.  Very reasonable for the good quality food you get.

After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.  We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also.  I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.",1
"Amazing quesadillas !!!! I had the steak, mushroom, and cheese as recommended by our server and man was I impressed! They are not the standard kind that I am used to. Fried and covered in lettuce and green sauce. The al pastor burrito was so hot and tasty as well. This is now my new favorite cheap delicious mexican joint! I wish the salsas were better and didnt all light my mouth on fire but hey, the food is awesome anyway and didnt need the salsas.",1
"Stopped by for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. Did not realize that the place had just opened (or at it appeared that way). Quite crowded with patrons, a bubble machine, and a DJ. 

It was bit loud with all the commotion, but still within reason. The menu is compact, but offered all the usual suspects. I went for the Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of cole slaw. I dumped the cole slaw on top of the pork and went to town on the sandwich. Meat was moist and smoky. The sauce had a hint of of kick. Very tasty.

The service was a bit slow, but the place was pretty much full up so I expected it to take a bit of time.

Good joint. Would return.",1
"Ok, so iv been a Starbucks junkie for years....until i discovered dutch bros! This location is my favorite, although they are all good. My favorite thing about dutch is you can order ANY blended drink sugar AND fat free. You cant do that with any frappes at starbucks. You cant beat their customer service either, all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat, always greeted with a smile! I once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new one..they exchanged my drink, apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge. added bonus is the stamp cards, so if your an avid coffee drinker like me, you'll be saving some money to. Quick drive-through for on the go.",1
"It had been a few years since I last gave this place a try. It hadn't blown me away as I had remembered, but I was still up to giving it another shot.  I must say that this place is much better than I had remembered. I stopped in for lunch and there were several people eating in there at the time. I ordered the Luncheon Special #3 (Cashew Chicken served with an egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, and a fortune cookie) for myself and a #1 special (Qwik special chicken which also came with all the additional stuff mentioned above) for a friend to go.  Each dish was only $6.25 a piece and were both ready in about 7 minutes. I guess the Qwik part wasn't just a clever name, they actually do cook stuff up pretty fast there.  I brought the food back to the office and tried my lunch. Yes, I also made sure to give my friend his lunch as well.  It was a dark meat chicken, white meat can be substituted, in your typical brown sauce with veggies and cashews. However it was done well. No one ingredient dominated the dish and there wasn't a ton of sauce. The egg roll was crispy and flaky and filled with veggie goodness as well. I like the fact that they will deliver as far south as Camelback, north to Cactus, east to 60th street, and west to 96th. They are open until 9:30 pm seven days a week which is nice as well. I went back to try some of the soups and the dumplings and I have to say that while the soup was good, the dumplings may just be in the top 3 that I have had in Arizona. They don't have that ""just unfrozen"" taste that many restaurants have. I think I would have given them that fifth star had they had both scallion pancakes and noodles w/ sesame sauce on their menu, but alas they do not.  I look forward to going back and trying many of their other dishes.",1
"Just went for my first time last night with ""the ""girls"". Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out.
Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine, the make-your-own cheeseboard and the to-die-for pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza. It was topped with fried sage leaves -- different and delicious. Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate. Sublime! Can't wait to go back and try other dishes - definitely made it to my 'Restaurants to Frequent' list :)",1
"This is a Mom & Pop Mexican restaurant on Tempe's east end, the food is awesome

"First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay, she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt we'll go back.",0

Always fresh and perfectly prepared. This is the only place my husband will take Japanese visitors from out of town. Enough said.,1
"I stayed here in March'10 and thought the place was alright, nothing to rave about but here was my experience:
PROS:
1.  Location was good for what I was there for (work)
2.  The nightly rates were really cheap (this had to do with my company more than the establishment though)
3.  Easy enough drive to/from the airport
4.  You can almost bypass Phoenix altogether getting to Scottsdale.
5.  Their was plenty of shopping places about a mile and a half up the road (think Best Buy, Target, McDonalds, etc...)
6.  A pretty happening restaurant/bar up the street that gets two thumbs-up
7.  The rooms were actually really spacious and nice...it was like having a luxury one bedroom apartment scaled down for size (full kitchen, massive bathroom, den seating area & king size bed in a comfortably sized room).
8.  Hot tub was rockin' & nobody gave us a hard time about having glass bottles out there.
CONS:
1.  Once I checked in, I had to lug a ton of stuff over to a room in the one of the back buildings and I couldn't see my rental car (maybe I'm weird...but I like to have my car close by)
2.  I unpacked and got situated to find that the internet in my room wasn't working (Must have!), called the front office and they had to move me to an entirely different room (mind you I just unpacked...AGH!)
3.  I ate dinner a couple times with co-workers in their lounge, & while it was good...it wasn't great, so we all ate at the restaurant/bar up the street the rest of the time.
4.  Be aware, you stand a decent chance of see spiders looming around...so you have been warned, but otherwise it's real clean.

I'd stay here again pending that I got the same room rates that I did last time, but it's my understanding having talked to the girls at the front desk that we got booked at unusually low rates.

***Don't get sucked into any of that ""time-share"" crap...they don't push it like some other places I've been...but it's NEVER a good investment***",0
"Great early bird specials on wine and mini-pitchers of beer before 5pm, only $5.  The food is very good and taylored to a wine menu.  A very nice place for a date with your wife or significant other.",1

"Surprised to have a good sushi place like this in Fountain Hills.  Can get expensive, but eat in or take out is always great.  Fun to mingle with the chef while making the sushi.",1

Staff is friendly and very knowledgeable.",1
"If you can look past the giant Meth billboard right outside and the general uncleanliness of the entire establishment, it's pretty wonderful... especially if your intentions involve eating a whole lobster, like myself.

Gourmet House of Hong Kong has the cheapest whole lobster dishes I've ever found, anywhere. I don't mean a measly, mid-western, tourist trap restaurant kind of lobster, I mean a damn good, meaty, savory, juicy morsel of deliciousness.

It's served a number of ways, but I usually go for the black bean sauce style. Then, I eat like nobody's watching, vow to never let my boyfriend see me like this, and usually end up getting sauce on my face, clothing, table, neighbors, etc. Go messy, or go home.",1
"Sure the food is good, but out of my last 20 take out orders they got it right maybe once.  The people making the food look so high you would think you were at Cheba Hut, but I just love that damn Broccoli and Wisconsin Cheese soup!  Their fresh dark rye bread is always great.

I enjoy the Italian quite a bit and the wife LOVES their tuna salad.  Great healthy place for food if they aren't too high to get your order right.",1
"A little pricey for my liking, but good nonetheless.  I really like the feel of the restaurant: part Cuban, part Puerto Rican, part Spanish, all classy.  A guitar player jammed away in a completely non-annoying way while we ate our meal and, to me, that is an accomplishment.

Our Calypso Chips were outstanding.  To die for.  One of the best appetizers I can think of at the moment.  For my entree, I ordered the Ropa Vieja which was made up of the most perfectly tender beef and tasty rice with beans.  A little heavy with the peppers, however.

Does anybody else think plantains smell like feet?  My date pointed this out and, although I was surprised, I'm inclined to agree.  That won't stop me from putting some into my stomach as soon as humanly possible.",1

"Inexpensive, tasty, fast. The gentle peanut dressing on the pre-meal salad gets you started on a simple, no-frills meal with exactly one option from all of the classic dishes you expect at a Thai restaurant in America: massaman, red, green, yellow, or panang curry; pad thai or chowmein; meat or vegetable rice plates. There's nothing extravagant in spices or food choices, but you can order the spiciness level to you liking.",1
"If you haven't shopped at a Fresh and Easy, the simple way to describe the store is it's like Trader Joe's.  Only Fresh and Easy has a modern feel to it instead of the hippie co-op atmosphere. For being a relatively small store, it carries a very good selection at very reasonable prices.   The thing they're best known for is the prepared meals that are relatively healthy, and only take minutes to heat up. 

One of their best features is their reduced priced on perishable foods. Almost everyday you can get a great deal on steak, beef, chicken or fish that's a day away from its pull date. As long as you're not picky, it's well worth it. 

The biggest problem I have is with their produce. For a place with ""Fresh"" in its title. I've notice that fruits and vegetables I buy from Fresh and Easy tend to expire pretty fast.",1
"Contemporary atmosphere.  Good range of Italian offerings.  Attentive wait staff.  Portions generous.  Price reasonable.  Food fine.

"ok, so really. how can you go wrong with burgers? i guess it's a just little absurd to me that people dress up to eat a burger. or that people choose to drink a glass of pricey wine instead of say, a root beer float with their burger. speaking of which, their rootbeer float is too pricey for what you get....

at any rate, i took my brother to eat here once upon a time, for kicks and giggles. see what all the hype is about. we were actually seated really quickly on a busy night, and quickly ordered our burgers. they were good. that goes without saying. and i really enjoyed the decor and the fries in the mini shopping cart! yes, something so ridiculous it is adorable. i don't really like having to order fries separate, because i think they should just come with your burger, but i digress. the burgers were juicy, came out fast and piping hot, cooked to our specifications, and surprisingly, not too much more expensive than my childhood fave, red robbins. ok fine, at least their fries had yummalicious dipping sauces.

i'd go again, just not on a busy night. and maybe i'd dress up a little more. but then i'd feel crazy - like, why am i wearing a dress to eat a burger? but i do like those fancy-schmancy burgers... i guess i can suck it up.",1
"I absolutely love this little spot! It's a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find. I've been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years. Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone, this is the first place that I head to. Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.

The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.

The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )",1
"Dave at Dave's Ashtanga is the best yoga teacher. He is kind, considerate, patient and a very nice person. He will take the time to show you a yoga move or asana. He is very knowledgeable about different subjects. What I like best is once he said, ""here you can do nothing wrong.""",1
"During my five-day stay in Tempe/Phoenix, I honestly did not have a single bad meal.  Every restaurant and coffee joint I stopped at gave me great experiences.  I wanted to end my trip out to Arizona with a good dinner, and I found myself at Dos Gringos to hopefully find that last meal out west.

Honestly, the name sold me pretty quickly.  Obviously, I'm not going to expect fine cuisine and classy dining at a place called Dos Gringos, but being a fan of dives and being one with my fellow man, it sounded like a good place to experience.

Despite it being chilly at night now this time of year, it was still an experience upon arrival.  It's like the tacky, somewhat tasteless, lampooned Mexican version of TGI Fridays, with a whole bunch of crap all over the walls, and a whole lot of hand-painted placards with sayings that make all of our inner-14-year-olds chuckle and appreciate.  The parking was free and plentiful, and I'm always a fan of the grungy, Christmas lights hanging all over the place kind of decor; my kind of style for relaxation and no-nonsense.

There were TVs everywhere, which was nice to watch some Sunday Night Football in the process, and I sat wherever I pleased.  Service was from a cute petite blond waitress who was quick to take my order, deliver my beer, and bring my food when it was ready.  I ordered an enchilada, and two ""street"" tacos, which were corn tortilla apparently.  Don't take my word for it, being an uneducated in Mexican food, east coaster, but I thought it was great.  Definitely different than the kind of ""Mexican"" food I can get in Atlanta.

Overall, I can't say that I had a bad experience.  The food was filling, not really expensive, and tasty to my tastebuds.  Beer, football on a mild evening in a place full of 56 pieces of tacky Mexican flair and a waitress with a great smile, and I can't complain.  Solid, adequate way to end my dining binging throughout the Phoenix/Tempe area.",1
"Mini burgers aren't a new idea or anything, but I have a habit of showing up to a restaurant starving and over ordering, so if a place can take care of the portion control for me I'm pretty pleased.  

The food is great - normally I get a Buffalo burger with sweet potato fries, and sometimes I'll toss in a Sloppy Joe for sentimental reasons, but the bartender Marshal has got to be one of my favorite parts. Always friendly. 

Comfortable place that's great for happy hour or as a stop during your normal Old Town rotation.",1
"Where are the managers????   It took 1 1/2 hours for our meal to come out at 8:15 in the evening.  Items came out at different times so we couldn't all eat at the same time.  The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didn't cut the ends.  Waitress just took it away and did not comp us.  Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu.  She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables.  Food was WAY over priced, and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud.  One of the worst dining experiences in a long time.  Paid $70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry.  HORRIBLE!",0
"Some of the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I prefer to get takeout since the inside is a little...eh... but who cares if the food's good! I love the crust, crispy and slightly chewy. The pizza can be a little greasy sometimes (but hey, it's pizza), but as long as it doesn't soak through and make the crust all flimsy (which has never happened with the pizzas I get here!) it's nothing that a paper towel or two can't fix! I'm not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says they're pretty good.

The staff has always been super-friendly, and they actually remember me, even though I only come in once every couple months!",1
"Why do you bring in the best bands and then torture me?

Parking is freaking ridiculous, at least I have been enough times to know to leave my car on Mill and walk.
Your security people are a bunch of freaking jerks who take their power wayyyy to seriously - take off my shoes? What kind of weapon or drugs can I be hiding in my open toed 2 inch heels?
Your sound SUCKS - seriously sucks. For all the fees you charge on top of tickets - buy some new speakers already.
The bathrooms are gross
Drinks are reasonable so you get 2 stars

"Sadly, my mom fell down a wet grassy hill walking her dog on Monday night and broke her ankle in two places. Ouch! She was rushed to Scottsdale Healthcare North in an ambulance and texted me on the way to alert me of her injury. Let's just say I hopped in the car without blinking and drove up to Scottsdale from Tucson as quickly and safely as possible. 

When I first arrived at the hospital she was in a very small room, directly off of the ER waiting room. Seriously, I thought  this was a closet, no joke! Jay, the RN, came in several times to check her blood pressure, take her to get x-rays, etc. You know....the typical hospital drill when you break your ankle! Anyhoo, he was so kind, gentle and had my mom in stitches (no pun intended - HA!) with his witty jokes. I could tell my mom thoroughly enjoyed his company and care. He was so wonderful and really helped take the pressure off of what was going to happen next....surgery! 

Shout out to Jay...You are awesome and thank you so much for going above and beyond to take such great care of my mom!

After five LONG hours of being in the ER, my mom was moved to her own room on the Orthopedic floor...FINALLY! (Side note, all rooms at Scottsdale Healthcare North are single room occupancy. This is such a fabulous accommodation!!! That means no fighting over the remote or loud snores coming from the other patient.....YAY for mom!)

At this point I knew this was going to be a long night and an extensive journey. We arrived at her room (on the 5h Floor) and were pleasantly surprised by the immediate welcoming of the evening nurses. They quickly got her settled into her room and made sure she was comfy. The room was small but super clean so no complaints there. 

A little while later we were told that my mom was going to have surgery sometime in the early morning but didn't have a confirmed time. Let's just say we both too tired to care because by now it was going on 2AM! 

I left the hospital and headed to my mom's house for a few hours of sleep before I returned in the morning for her pending surgery. Got there around 8ish and still no surgery time. Ok, at this point my only complaint was the waiting and the unidentified time of her surgery. This seriously went on all day until finally at 6pm she was wheeled down to pre-op. Again, more waiting as the anesthesiologist had a crisis situation with another patient. At this time I was fortunate enough to meet Dr. Nelson who was performing the surgery on her ankle. My impression of Dr. Nelson was that he was very warm, compassionate and informative. He asked for my phone number and said he would call me directly after mom's surgery with an update.....and he did! 

An hour or so later my mom arrived back at her room from recovery. All went well and it was time for sleep. I returned the following day (Wednesday) and waited her release. Ugh, more waiting.  My mom was finally released Wednesday evening around 8pm with no problems or issues. YAY, we are going home. 

Overall, the experience at Scottsdale Healthcare North was pleasant and satisfying and I'm so thankful for their excellent and professional care with my mom! The doctors, nurses, physical therapists and aids were amazing, caring and extremely helpful. You can really tell these people are passionate about their job. Fabulous job Scottsdale Healthcare North!!! 

Oh, one more thing.....
Note to mom - no more slipping down wet grassy hills!",1
"Hmm-Didn't love it, didn't hate it. I was indifferent.
I like the decor and if I could give it a half a star just for having an outdoor dining area, I would.
The menu left a lot to be desired for me. We went at lunch time so I don't know what the dinner menu looks like.
It was just ok. Nothing blew me away. It's nice for people watching and has a really nice location.",0
"A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim.",1
"ok, let me be straight with you. i hate paying full price for anything. yes, i'm one of those people. i love a coupon. i love a discount. and i absolutely love a bargain! but i don't like to feel dirty when i leave a store. i felt really, really dirty when i left this store. ewwwwww. this is a yucky ross. dirty, dirty, dirty! the floors and clothing racks were filthy. i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black ""stuff"" on my hand after touching a clothing rack. the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was. parts of the store's floor were sticky. many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them, presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on. selection was meager, there wasn't a single shoe, bag, wallet, sock or home decor item that caught my eye. the trip was a waste of an hour that i'll never get back. never, ever again.",0
"So going on vacation in a week and wanted to get a brazilian for the first time.  I gotta say the technician, Christine, was great!  She tells you what to expect and tosses in a little humor to keep you comfortable.  It was very clean, the wax isn't to hot, and the technician never double dipped.  I found the place very clean and comfortable.  Pricing is just right too.  I like that there are options to buy it for a year and go anywhere they have a shop.

I did get told about product as others reviewed.  However, I didn't feel pushed because Christine explained how it can be used and why.  In addition, she told me of other uses for the product.  

It was an all around good experience that I would recommend to any friend wanting to get waxed.",1
Great eats at this joint. New York strip was awesome! Pear salad was bomb and service was superb. I'll be back march 10th!,1
"Stonecreek is a nice place to play, and the price is fair.  I do like the layout.  Fun but not gimmicky.  The scenery is nice, too.

I will have to agree with others about the ball vacuum (aka creek) running right through the middle of the course.  

The staff also seemed nice enough when I was there.  I'm not sure what others were complaining about.  Overall, it's a decent place to play, and its location makes it ideal if you're meeting people from the other side of town.",1
"We were so disappointed!  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.  It was nothing like the one we have had home.  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didn't have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I don't know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :(",0
"I absolutely love, love, LOVE the ambiance and decor of Modern Steak. It's beautiful. 

Came for Arizona Restaurant Week 2010. I would have never, ever picked this restaurant based on it's name. I do not eat steak, nor will I ever eat steak, but my friend wanted to go so I agreed since there were non-steak items on the Restaurant Week menu. I'm so happy we did! 

For the first course, I debated between the crispy shrimp and the chopped salad and based on the waiters recommendation, I ordered the chopped salad with avocado, crispy vegetables and parmesan. Loved the huge chunks of avocado in it! 

For the second course, I ordered the tortelli (a version of tortellini). It was the perfect size, not too big, not too small. Enough for one person. It was delicious! It was stuffed with artichoke and cheese and was heavenly. I wish I had the recipe so I could attempt to make it at home. 

The dessert of Peanut Butter Cup was equally delicious. It's not what you'd expect it to be: it's smooth and creamy with a hint of chocolate, but it's damn good! I was so full from my meal and couldn't finish all of it so I asked the waiter to scoop it out into a to-go box for me and he laughed, but happily packed it up. I didn't wanna waste any of that peanut butter goodness! 

I'm so surprised in Modern Steak. I'm glad I gave it a chance, despite it's namesake. I'll definitely go back and tell all my friends about it too.",1
Fine for an overnight at the airport. Not a vacation destination. Needs a full restoration. Breakfast included.,0
"I'll preface this review by saying that I've never been a fan of hospitals. My experience with hospitals growing up was always to visit friends or relatives that were sick or recovering from accidents, and I've never felt 100% comfortable at the site of blood, dealing with disease, or ""scary"" situations.  For these reasons, I really respect doctors, nurses, and all of the staff that work at hospitals to help those in need on a daily basis.

All of that being said, I've seen my fair share of emergency rooms in the last few years, and for the most part, I've had decent experiences, even as the patient.  I've actually been to this Scottsdale Healthcare location three times already in the past eight months: twice for scares with the pregnancy and once for a breastfeeding class.  This is the hospital where my OB/GYN delivers, so naturally, this is where I'll be heading when Baby Mess is ready to enter the world... and I'm confident that I'll be in good hands when the time comes!

I've heard great things about the facility itself, especially the labor/delivery area, from other friends that have delivered here.  And from my experience to date, the staff has always been great as well.  Parking can be tricky, but they do offer complimentary parking during the week... and the breastfeeding class I took was very informative.

Bottom line: I don't think any hospital will ever be at the top of my list of ""fun places to hang-out,"" but if you or someone you know is in a situation where medical help / a hospital is needed, you can't go wrong with Scottsdale Healthcare.  Fingers crossed, I'll still feel this same way after I deliver this baby!",1
"I used to work here so it had to be good;) Honestly, I would say it is the most friendly place I had been to. Cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers. The prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful. I just wish it was a Marketplace instead.",1
"I've been here a couple of times when I was in college, and once or twice since I've graduated. A memorable time while in college was my friends 21st bday on a Thursday night I came here on a party bus with some people (including some guy from the Real World) and they had a fountain of champagne with strawberries. All you can drink is definitely a bad idea for me because I felt the wrath and had to call into work the next day. But it was a whole lot of fun! Recently I came here with my bf and some friends and I must say I had a great time. I was happy to have a little more than annoying house music all night. They played a wide variety of music that was fun to dance to. I also loved the pussycat dancer that dances above the DJ, it's pretty cool when the two way mirror reveals a bed and sexy burlesque dancer! The bartenders are pretty cool and I didn't have to wait very long to get service. I think PCL is a decent bar based on my experiences.",1
We drive a little out of the way to go this target because it's clean and is surrounded but many other stores we frequent.   It's usually pretty busy so plan to park a bit further than most.,1
"There's 1 casino my tia wont go to, but she doesn't remember the name of it. Guess what? I think this is the place... 

I thought Wild Horse Pass Casino was already open. No! Not until Oct. 30. I think Wild Horse needs to reword their billboards. So we drove a few minutes down and ended up at Gila River Casino. Next time, I'll pass! 

Super small, lame security and the machines suck (literally, the machines inhale your money like it's water). I spent $50 within 3 mins without winning anything. What made me scratch my head was the set up of the machines. You'll see a row of .25 cent machines then a random $5.00 machine in the middle of it! Or a row of $1.00 machines and a random $25.00 machine thrown into it! What the heck? 

Again, I'll pass on Gila River.",0
"I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over the Labor Day weekend after viewing some items on their website.  I was extremely under underwhelmed by the service I received and do not plan on returning.  

When I arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance.  Besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty.  I spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple ""Hello"", even as I was viewing items directly in front of the counter.  When I was leaving the store she did break long enough to say ""Bye"".

I believe it is very important to support local business but I will not spend my money here.  I did find several items I wanted to buy and made note of the artist. I have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels.  I do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location.",0

"UMMMMMMMM...can I just say that this place needs to get more action!  The pizzas here are FANTASTIC!!  I discovered this place because it opened above SACKS.  It is around the corner from my house and I am so thankful it is.  The whole restaurant is open...I wish it had a little more space, but that is ok.  First, the Tuscan Pie is to die for!!  It has prosciutto, Gorgonzola, apple, arugula, a fig marmalade and balsalmic vingerette reduction sauce drizzled on top...at least I think that is what it is...I need to check the menu...but anyways its FABULOUS!!!  I wish I could eat it everyday!  I tried their Moroccan Pizza before they took it off the menu and it was awesome too!  Every single salad is great and the wine and beer selection is great too!  The staff is so nice and friendly.  I get this to go all the time and bring it home...and I have shared this with my friends too.  I love good Italian pizza and its great!",1
Dr Norton and his staff are friendly and professional. They have made my 3 children feel relaxed and comfortable. I highly recommend this office.,1
"I had Smashburger for the first time a couple of days ago and I was not impressed. My burger was way too greasy. The smashfries were good but they were greasy as well. I'm not expecting for my burger to be dry but there is a major difference between juicy and greasy and they crossed over into the land of the grease. And they were heavy handed with the salt. Unless I want my sodium intake for the week in 1 day, I would suggest that they move away from the salt.

They are similar to Five Guys in that they have no combos but they have more options. I can see what the appeal is and maybe the cook was having a bad day but between the grease and the salt I will not be going back unless I have a death wish.",0
"You are seeing a continuing trend here. When it first opened it was a 5 star place but since then the pizza has been inconsistent and going down hill. The last pizza I ordered, the crust was soggy and it had too much yeast. The cheese was also too rubbery and tasteless.

I grew up watching 90210 like many of us ""old folks."" They had the Peach Pit. Do you remember that place. Well Jimmy and Joes is the pizza version of the Peach Pit. Yes, me and my 30's felt age inappropriate when I arrived. And I immediately felt like I was in high school again when I went to grab a tiny ketchup cup to grab some wing sauce and they said it was 60 cents. Another person walked in and they gave him a hard time because he didn't have his coupon on him even though he read the coupon code over the phone. It had that high school vibe..you know the one I'm talking about the...""I owe you 3 dollars and I'll pay you back tomorrow."" vibe.  That vibe is felt when you park there. There is limited parking as it is and whatever parking they have, there are signs that limit you to 20 minutes parking almost implying they don't want you to eat there. I was too afraid to take napkins because I'm sure it had some price or limitation attached just like everything else there.

I've eaten here several times and I've reached this conclusion: eat at the place but don't pick up pizza here. JJ specializes in the one slice and drink. Their short slices are done well and if you don't eat it hot when it comes right out of the oven, it loses it's flavor fast. I've picked up pizza and it's almost like two different pizzas. When I picked it up, the cheese was exrtremely rubbery and the crust was so chewy like steak. This is a great place for a short lunch or a business lunch but I wouldn't order several pies if I was hosting a Superbowl party or had people over.",0
"I had been wanting to come back for a while.  I love this restaurant.  Last night we had a magnificent meal.  I started with the St. Francis Lemonade, a perfect cocktail to start your meal.  There are so many wonderful choices.  They are featuring a special menu for New Years, however you can order from it ""a la carte"", so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad.  It was delicious.  I love the combination of dates, goat cheese and orange slices.  I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops.  WOW, they were so sweet and tender.  They were served over a bed of black lentils, so amazing.  The portion was generous, 5 scallops, I am glad I didn't order the side of sweet corn polenta.  I ended up ordering dessert (yes my hubby twisted my arm, NOT).  I had the usual, Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake.  I had a bite of his and it was great.  I cannot guarantee I won't stick to my usual dessert, but it was a closed one.  I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live.  It is such a great place.",1
"Off the chainco's! lol

Today my friends and I pondered what to eat.. a good sandwich was was we decided on but where? Looked right here on yelp and it came up.. most the reviews were good so we went for it. WOW.

I like to ask for a knock my socks off never been here suggestion and he offered up the cheese steak, with peppers and mushroom. I went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish.. he handed me a sample of the tortalini and I was in heaven.

Service was polite, the place was busy but not crowded, it was clean, and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order.  Took about 10 minutes to arrive, not bad.

I thought the price was fair  and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling.


While eating my buddy joked the place was off the chain.. and should rename itself to ""off the chainco's"" lol

Highly recommended and cant wait to take others here.

"This is the best venue in the valley for what is intended to be; a midsize venue that attracts national touring acts, with a standing room only intimacy that you won't get at a place bigger or smaller. I saw Clutch here recently, and it rocked my balls off. I didn't drink at the place (took care of that before and after) so I can't comment on drink prices. Parking did suck, but there was a structure across the street for five bucks. One downside, going to the website to check out upcoming shows is tedious. The calendar is soooo hard to sort through, I would only go there to get more info on opening bands not listed on ticketmaster.com",1
"Old Town Tortilla Factory does a fantastic job with Mexican/New Mexican cuisine.  The chicken pinwheels that were supposedly featured on the Food Network or something are phenomenal.  There's a good variety of entrees featuring different types of seafood and meat, and plenty of southwest flavors.  The margaritas, served with a little shaker of extra, are excellent too.  My mom actually drank a whole one, which, maybe you don't know my mom, but, trust me, is saying something.  The ambiance out on the patio (when it's not too hot outside) is quite comfortable and cozy, with the fountain and the strings of lights.  Also, they have homemade flavored tortillas, with different flavors featured daily, but sometimes the waitstaff doesn't seem overly eager to give them out.  Had to deduct one star for service.  Other than that, I highly recommend this place.",1
"I went to Susie's for lunch the other day. I got it to go, as I was alone and don't like to eat at restaurants by myself. There was only a few people inside and the food seemed to come pretty fast if you eat in. 

I probably waited about 20 mins for my to go food. I thought the restaurant was in need of a remodel. But they don't seem like they have the greatest hours, as they close at 5pm. So it is a lunch place, not a dinner place.

I got my food and took it home. I live not even a mile from this place. I ordered Sopes. They had shredded beef, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and salsa. I thought they were very comparable to the ones I have had before, which were homemade. 

I would like to go back for lunch, but as I'm not home much for lunch it might be difficult! Definitely worth a second chance!",0
"We had lunch here with the In-laws today. Highlights: the wait staff is awesome. Fast, friendly, fun; everyone here is ON it.
Lowlights: the food. It's not terrible, but kind of meets expectations of a diner in a strip mall. Weak coffee, white bread, smaller portions, nothing was particularly great. Nothing really sucked; but was just mediocre. They must be doing something right, it was crowded and my in-laws like it. I'd rather go without eating than visit here again.",0
"The interior is very industrial and charming; furnished with iron beams, brick walls and simple hanging lightbulbs. The lobby area has special imported drinks and other trinkets. There is always a line but it usually goes pretty quick because you're distracted by all of their deserts and miscellaneous goodies on display. I've never had a meal that wasn't awesome here. I usually find myself eating the simple but delicious Liberty Joe with their special spicy sauce and then finishing the meal off with a home-made snicker-doodle. Whatever you end up ordering, I'm sure you'll end up enjoying Liberty Market as greatly and as frequently as I do!",1
"I had my first experience with Matt's this morning. A friend of mine had seen it on Diner's, Dives and Drive In's (or something along those lines) and was excited to try it out. The wait was about 20 minutes(arrived at 9 am) and seating is very limited but worth it!

I'm all about the breakfast food so I was excited to try somewhere new. The menu is limited but covers all bases. The coffee (a special blend just for them) is local as is everything that they serve. I swear the bacon tastes better when it's from around the corner.

I decided on the belgian waffle and a side of hash browns. SUPER YUMMY!! I appreciate the note on the menu that they only use butter and extra virgin olive oil... No trans fats here! The hash browns were a bit oily but tasty overall.

As I was leaving I saw a huge stack of pancakes on their way to a table... I know what I'm getting next time!!",1
"I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, there's a good variety of ""ethnic"" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and they're just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out. 

Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials 

They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!",1

"My husband got back today from New Jersey (what a relief he isn't stuck in Hurricane Irene's path anymore!) and since we were in the neighborhood we figured we'd go to Over Easy.  Read my most recent review on how that went (ie, a bust.)

We stopped at Starbucks at the Safeway next to Over Easy and got our kids a pastry each while we figured out what we'd do.  I turned to trusty yelp on my droid and they said that not only was Taylor's Cafe open, they do breakfast, and they were only about a mile from where we were.  We decided to give breakfast one more try, called Taylor's and put our names on the list.

When we arrived it was a little hard to find, but we called and they told us where it is.  The decor is cozy and inviting.  We waited at the bar for a few minutes while a table was readied, the manager was very attentive.  I told him what happened at Over Easy and he was horrified.  We live in Avondale, we're willing to drive for a good breakfast and also pay a bit more for good food and good service.  Let me tell you, Taylor's Cafe really turned the morning around for us!

My kids each ordered an apple juice, and one got chocolate chip pancakes, the other got strawberry waffles.  Their kids menu is $8 each, but the portions are huge, it's easily something an adult would put away.  I stole a bite from each, they were very tasty and there was enough for doggie bags.

My husband got a build your own omelet with 3 different cheeses and chicken sausage.  With his omelet he got 2 choices for sides, so he chose hash browns and cottage cheese (he almost went with a bagel but was pleased to hear about the cottage cheese.)  The chicken sausage was an interesting option that we had not expected.  He also ordered a mocha, which at $4 was about the size of what you'd get at Starbucks, and my husband said that it was on par with their quality.

I ordered the Joe's special, intrigued by the list of ingredients.  It was flavorful and delicious.  The country potatoes were very tasty.  I ordered the homemade raspberry lemonade, it was tangy and sweet, really tasty on a hot summer day.

We came to the decision on 4 stars because the food was good, but not out of this world.  They have fantastic options for the health conscious, and it seems to be popular with the patrons of a local gym because there were tons of people coming in work out gear.  There is plenty of space (you don't feel like sardines in a can), the staff is polite, competent, and professional,  and the ambiance is nice.  We will definitely be coming back.",1
"I'm not normally a big fan of Italian food, but after marching six miles against 1070 in the Memorial Day weekend heat, I decided it was time to slang my Groupon on the table and carb it up.  And, fortunately, this was my favorite Groupon find yet.

Aiello's is in a beautiful building.  I don't think a building has ever detracted from my eating experience, but in case's like Aiello's, the wonderful shaded, verdant patio set the mood in all the right ways.

The inside is low-key family restaurant with a dash of romance.  Nice lighting, not too loud, cool bar.

The food was awesome.  Delicious, probably house-made pasta with simple flavors that let the sauces and vegetables sing.  An exhaustive - but not daunting - wine list - though it'd be nice to see more options served by-the-glass.

As icing on the cake, at the end of the meal, you get to play a game that might let you get your meal for free.  I won't ruin the surprise, but it adds a lot of character.

If I had an Italian grandmother, this is the sort of food I'd expect she'd make.  Highly recommended for a date night, classic dinner-and-a-movie style, for unpretentious delicious fare.",1
"Dear Lo-Lo's why do you have to be so damn good!?  I really wish that when I had you last weekend you had been dry and tasteless so that I wouldn't have to come back and eat Fried Chicken and Waffles again... but now you have made me an addict to your delicious mouth-watering juicy breasts & thighs... Woah where is this going?! LOL Thank goodness you do takeout for now my husband will have to do his husbandly duty and pick me up a piece or two on his way home from work.... 

Truly wonderful... I never had waffles with fried chicken before and I'm not sure why I was so surprised at how great this pairing would be but I was... Great service, everyone was friendly and upbeat and seemed to actually enjoy working there which is definitely a PLUS! ;-) I love you Lo-lo's!",1
"Pretty good food.  Place is funky, weren't many people in there for a Saturday lunch (especially considering the proximity to ASU) but the service was decent and the food was good.  Very inexpensive, 2 lunches and drinks for $15.  I'll stop by again when I'm out that way.",1
Great food!  The FEZ burger is a real winner.  The staff and clientele are friendly.  Great place to meet people for drinks and hang out.,1
"Possibly the best Pho soup I have ever had! I can't believe I ate the whole thing! Well...yes I can, actually. 

What clinched it for me was that I ordered it To Go, which is almost never a good idea when it comes to the pho (do not attempt to assemble at your desk! I repeat! Do NOT assemble at your desk!). But everything was securely packaged and well-presented. Plenty of everything (noodles, meat, herbs, sauce, jalapenos, etc) and oh so tasty. 

I've got my sights set on the BBQ Pork & Rice noodle bowls for my next visit, which will be soon. 

Go get your pho on!",1
"I've been here a couple times and from reading other reviews, I must have come on a good night!  Both times I was here we sat on the patio and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  They have a large rock pit? in the middle that they light when it's cold for heat.  

I really love the mussels in the white sauce here and last time I also had the spinach salad.  It was delicious!  Fresh and served with the perfect amount of bacon vinaigrette.

The service is good, nothing special - but what is with the waitresses wearing flip flops?  I just don't see how that is sanitary especially if they're walking in the kitchen.  

Overall it was good and I'm sure I'll be back.  I keep meaning to come for happy hour when they have 1/2 price appetizers!  A bowl of mussels and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc is all I need for an inexpensive and tasty dinner.",1
"Standing like a paragon of virtue in a sea of decadence, U.S. Egg's Scottsdale's location is place of redemption, both for your soul and your appetite. Open only for breakfast and lunch, the restaurant attracts as diverse a clientele as the 'dale itself. This is not somewhere that relies on being a tourist trap: some locals are known to eat here daily.

Its location is slightly outside the Old Town Pale, but still within walking distance unless it's the height of summer. Secondly, it has its own parking lot, making it as accessible as Denny's or a Marie Callendars. Nevertheless the lot is often full on weekend mornings, and you will definitely see people waiting. unless you arrive very early or late. There is both an outdoor patio seating area and a large indoor dining room.

Having gone numerous times alone, I am always impressed how quickly I am seated. No bias against tables for one here. The servers are all personable and graceful...yet not self-aggrandizing. This is not a Michelin four-star restaurant however, and you should not expect being waited on hand and foot. Given the volume of service, it's also commendable how few mistakes are made and how prompt everything is.

The food is also excellent. Although you can order both lunch or breakfast, I tend to crave the latter more. There's plenty of variety on the menu and they have both innovative dishes and old staples. This helps to explain why the uber-fab Scottsdale club kids patronize this place just as much as the Cadillac set. Prices are very reasonable for Scottsdale, though perhaps too much for a dirt-poor college student or person living only on Social Security.

The building also capitalizes on Arizona's sunny weather with high ceilings and plenty of windows...causing plenty of light to splash in and helping to evoke that sense of morning and freshness. There's plenty of ambient noise as a result...but it's almost reassuring. Not to mention that the hearing-aid crowd and club crawlers may be too deaf to notice.

U.S. Egg is not flawless, however. From a cost point of view, the restaurant has to contend with the fact that breakfast is usually the cheapest meal of the day. Without a dinner menu though to recoup cost, diners have to grin and bear any perceived cost imbalance from say  Denny's. Neverthless it's still worth it, in my opinion. The other shortcoming stems from the food. Different dishes often rely on the same sides. If you get sick of their potatoes for example, you can be really out of luck despite ordering something different every time. Moreover their signature dishes again may not impress truly demandng foodies.

While it may not cure your hangover (or incontinence), U.S. Egg remains firmly on the map for locals. Managing to please all of Scottsdale is a tall order, and the owners, managers, and staff all should stand tall and be proud.",1
"There are few places that are delicious hole in the wall chains.  In fact there really are no hole in the wall chains except Two Hippies and they do it right.  Upon entering two hippies you will see all kinds of crazy decor like a twister mat on the ceiling, chairs... on the ceiling, etc.  Your food options consist of Burgers, Hot Dogs and Tacos, where as your beverage choices consist of regular stuff like various sodas to flavored tea and lemonade.  The flavored tea and lemonade is AMAZING, the flavor in the flavored teas is so good you don't even need to add sweetener, that's impressive.  The food is equally as delicious, I had 2 tacos one was fish (not fried, baked tilapia -so good and healthier) and green beef, they have a red beef and green both are cooked with different peppers and marinades,  The green beef was amazing I'm def. looking forward to trying the red beef as well as the ""cactus"" taco which is just insane sounding.  Two thumbs up, bring cash though because that's all they take :)",1
I've been to other Pei Wei's in the valley and I've yet to see any as busy as this one. The food is consistently good; do expect about a 20 minute wait for food if you are dining in. They recently got the new Coke touch machines where you can make your own flavor combo! YUM! This place can get noisy; I wouldn't recommend bringing kids since this place is very hectic and can be overwhelming to small children. Take Out is stellar and most of the time food is ready when promised.,1
"I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?  Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best.",1
I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I won't be returning here. I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.,0
"Every friday, my dad and I eat here. We order the same thing... pizza wraps. they are good and fillng. iced tea hits the spot. Typical strip mall pizza.",0
I've been to the locations in Chandler and Mesa and one word describes both locations: Fresh.  Their donuts are consistently soft and fresh.,1
It's Pei Wei. The service and food are always satisfactory.,0
"Amazing facility. Scottsdale healthcare has done a great job, the people are happy to work here unlike some hospitals. They are very receptive and the ER operates like clockwork.",1
"I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.

We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!",1
"First time in this restaurant.  It is next to Golds Gym on the n/e of Northsite and Raintree Dr.  

 It is similar to Chipotle but the pinto beans are better tasting, the chicken is all white meat.  The employees are very friendly and will take the time to chat with you.  They learn what you like if you are a regular and will just confirm that there aren't any changes.  
Burritos, tacos and salads are the main items to choose from.  
This is a very good spot to eat and enjoy the food.  The soft drinks are not watered down like most other places are now a days.
Enjoy, I will.   Oh, they have a card that you buy 10 and the next purchase is free.",1
"Eh.... 2.5 stars, maybe? 3? Not sure, yet.

After looking at the menu online, I really wanted to like this place. The menu has some creativity to it, unlike the template-North-Indian-restaurant-menus you find at many of the Indian restaurants in the Valley. Aside from offering things like korma, kadai, vindaloo, etc. with a variety of options (chicken, lamb, paneer, shrimp or fish for each) they also have some other more unusual choices, like one of my favorite dishes, mattar malai methi (creamy fenugreek and peas). And dahi vada in the appetizers... I couldn't wait to check it out.
Unfortunately, three friends and I went at lunchtime on a Saturday - and there was a buffet. So I didn't get to try any of those tempting dishes.

The restaurant itself, while  decorated a little haphazardly (Chinese paintings?) is bright and clean. There's a TV on a wall, which happened to be playing one of my favorite Bollywood movies...so I was still excited about the place.

But...after tasting the food...meh.

The buffet was all right.. but nothing to write home about. Pluses? Once again, it had something different..fish curry as well as an Indian-style Chinese dish or two. So that was cool. But the food was just so-so. I was there fwith three other people - one of them said the cuts of meat, especially the chicken, were of higher quality than most Indian buffets. But he didn't like the sauces so much. One other friend said he liked the tikka masala, but that was about it.
As for the vegetarians, well, we didn't have a lot of choices. Veggie manchurian (which was pretty good), a very bland chana masala and some pea/carrot thing that reminded me more of baby food than anything else.
The dessert was just all right, too. And the rice was very bland.

So, overall, I wasn't impressed. But I don't want to judge the place too harshly based just on the buffet. After all, Curry House was packed on a Saturday afternoon, so I'm thinking maybe it's got something better to offer me.. I'll have to go back for dinner and see what their non-buffet selections taste like before I totally write this place off my list.",0
"I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is. Wrong.  The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service, alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery. Fuck it...stick to Slices.",0
I had the fruits of the forest flavor and really enjoyed it.  Staff was very helpful.  Will definitely be coming back.,1
"The shopping center this Rack is located in is absolute poison to my pocketbook. TJ Maxx, Ross and Nordstrom Rack all in a tidy row? Rock on! 

There are great deals to be found here with patient and selective hunting like any other discount retailer, and that these great deals are on brands which Nordstrom's carries makes any awesome deal so very much sweeter. 

Don't go expecting to strike gold at every visit, or expecting Ross prices on Guess shoes, and you will fall in love with the store.",1
"The place was pretty empty - even for an off night. The service was pretty decent, but like I said - it was empty. 

I've been in here a few times, but never when it's busy. The prices don't impress me, but I'd say you get a pretty decent pour for the money. 

One thing I'd like to point out - a 1.5L bottle of Dom is less than 1000 bucks, but a 3.0L bottle of Dom is 3500. If you're a fucking idiot, get the 3L. If you're a smart shopper, you'll get two 1.5L bottles or else just by the glass - which works out even cheaper. Just so you know, it works the opposite way Costco does. If you're getting a big ass bottle of Dom anyway, you probably don't care.

The decor is red. It's very dark in here at night... dark and loungy rather than clubby. Similar to Merc Bar, but not as hip or hidden... even though they try to hide it with curtains. It's also pleasantly quiet in here... easy to have conversations. 

With the patio door open, you're going to smell cigarettes people are smoking outside if you're sitting at the bar or on the couch adjacent to there. 

It's a nice bar, but I don't know that I'd single it out as a ""place to be."" I actually think the Mondrian is pretty nice - but that's based entirely on good memories that are completely unrelated to the place and have more to do with the people I was with at the time. If someone wealthy and hip was here from out of town looking to party, the Mondrian is one of a handful of hotels I'd suggest. Not so much because of Red Bar, but more because it's conveniently located within stumbling home distance to so many other better bars in Downtown.",0
"Great little hole in the wall with authentic New Mexican food.  Chili Relleno was awesome, and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy.  Rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious. Atmosphere was cozy.  If you want real red and green chile vs. sauce this is the place.",1
"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth.

Ok, I'll wait.

Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  That's when she said to us. ""Your table inside is ready""  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick!

We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though.

Awesome place!",1
"Went there with the Wife. Lots of stuff for the ladies. I would lay off making any real purchase here on my own, I would of course consult the Mrs. In regards to what she might like. Way to tough to try and pick something out in here (Louis Vuitton, Gucci, etc.) that is the stuff for the ladies to decide on. Nice place, very friendly staff, warm, and inviting one to buy.",1
"-Biggest Joann's store

-Great fabric selection

-Clean store, good layout (different from other Joann stores)

-Convenient location (parking is not too bad).

-Employees are friendly.

-Restrooms are blah and smell.",1
"I hate being disappointed by bars bragging about their ""huge"" number of taps... while I can't dispute that they have 52 beers on tap, I can tell you that very few of them are worth drinking.. and that the prices here are on the ok to high side... I would never come back if it's not happy hour or late night pricing. I asked general questions about not discounted pricing, nine dollars for a Manhattan made with Jack Daniels and beers ranging from five to seven dollars... if I'm paying seven bucks for a pint at a sports bar in Tempe it had better be something from Russian River or a Stone anniversary brew... and a nine dollar Manhattan seems out of place... this isn't Scottsdale or a hotel bar.
   Well the good news, Thirsty Lion is quite lovely inside, plenty of seating and dim lights, really not a bad place to relax and mellow out. Plus, the food was great, everything we've had has been very tasty, now it's all been off of the happy hour menu, but that's the only time I'll probably be here, the scotch eggs are delicious and my main recommendation. I'm hoping that in time prices will drop a bit and more craft breweries will get represented, but aside from the nice interior and spot on happy hour menu, Thirsty Lion just doesn't stand out enough to steal me away from Boulders or Taste of Tops...",0
"Love this place. the atmosphere was rather chill and calm. We played Uno, and drank pretty darn good coffee! we had a lemon cookie, which was...JUST RIGHT!",1
"New N. Scottsdale location, Baaaaaaad!  The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight.  $10.00 for a mediocre burger, with an uncooked, tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula.  They forgot the sauce, which apparently is the main ingredient.  The upgrades are ridiculous.  $1.00 here for cheese on an already ""well priced"" burger (btw Flemings blue cheese/bacon burger $6, best in town), $5,00 here for fries.  C'mon.  And, it's the same two hispanic guys, who don't have any idea about chef inspired food, cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant, there is no chef For the price, you want to see the chef/owner representing, especially at a new location, and, you want competent staff who treats you as #1, and not their conversing with the other staff members as #1, and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town!  What a disappointment.  The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience.  Take a pass.",0
"I hate food shopping.  Okay that is probably an understatement.  When I go to a big market I am so overwhelmed and usually end up with a million things I don't need, while forgetting the things I do need.  Fresh & Easy is small, but it has most things I need.  I like that they have meats and chicken that already have seasoning on it and are ready to cook.  This makes shopping extremely easy.  I also really like their brand of food, especially the pasta.  I think it's some of the best tasting store bought pasta I have had.  Don't go here if you need to buy kitchen supplies like cake pans or cookie sheets.  They simply have food, drinks, wine and beer here.",1
"They have good baked baguettes and the price was $1.50 last month, however raising the price to $2 per roll during the holiday's is ridiculous.  The female cashier was short and unprofessional.  While i was waiting for the rolls, she was rude to the next three customers spending money.  They need to work on their customer service and I vowed never to go back.",0
"I went because several people I know raved about the place, because I'm a lapsed vegetarian and I'm always trying to get back on track and heard the veggie sandwiches were incredible, and because I'm a malt freak and found out they have malteds there.

I was disappointed. And my friend I was with who had been one of Stickler's die-hard fans said that, although it was okay this time, the place seems to have gone down hill.

Stickler's wasn't busy at all, maybe 4 tables of customers and 3 people in line, but although there were alot of workers behind the counter, the service was very slow. We had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches. Now my friend has been there when it was jam-packed and she said the service then was much quicker. We went about 2 so maybe the staff was worn out from the lunch rush earlier.

The bread was good, crunchy on the outside and soft inside but the vegetarian sandwich itself was boring. It's supposed to have Swiss, Provolone and American cheese on it. I couldn't even taste the Swiss or Provolone at all, the American over powered the sandwich and was more like a cheez-whiz type.

I'm always on the look out for a good malt, one that really tastes like a malt and not a shake. My chocolate malt tasted more like a shake and I wasn't impressed with the ice cream. My buddy liked her vanilla malt though.

The one thing I did like about Stickler's is that they have the small bags of Miss Vickie's chips to buy. It used to be you could buy big bags in the grocery stores but now the chips,which are the best kettle chips I've ever had, are just carried in certain deli and sandwich shops.",0
Really delicious breakfast burritos! They are true Mexican-style! I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla. They are inexpensive and really big! I'm so glad I work a mile from this place! I go at least once a week!,1
"How have I not sang Scott's praises yet? Well, here I go! 

Do you want a place for a good, solid, stick to your ribs breakfast without being too frou frou? Scott's is the joint! It's a Jewish deli in the middle of my neighborhood! I was so surprised that I hadn't noticed it before! Chrissy P invited me to join her for breakfast one morning and I was just blown away! On my first visit, I had the eggs Benedict. My only complaint was that my eggs were a tad overcooked, (not runny) and I wished for more hollandaise sauce. 

For my second visit, I brought my little sis and her BFF and we chowed! I had the Hash Mash and we shared an order of the french toast. I don't know why I challenged myself to my own personal ""how much breakfast can you stuff into your stomach"" contest, but I think I won. Everything was so good! There was nothing to complain about. 

I wish I could go to Scott's every day for a hearty breakfast! The dishes are simple, the service is straight forward, and I have NEVER walked away hungry. I will return very, very soon!",1
"I have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever. I went to the shop with my daughter, her friend and my niece...all young adults. I showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me.  I noticed she was playing Solitaire on her iPad...apparently we interrupted her game. She then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother, the owner of the store, would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance.  The girls and I had body lotion on, this is the desert for crying out loud, and not one of us had perfume on.  Then the mother arrived, there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door. Seriously? Unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and I'm sorry that I spent the $68. I could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out. If I knew how to give less than 1 star, I would. It was unbelievable. I empathize with the woman and her allergies, but the situation could have been handled so much better.",0
"This is great if you are in a hurry, they have slices and salads ready to go. Above average quality and a nice open space too. Perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door.",0
"I must admit, I'm more of a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market guy (due to the economy), but I had a great time shopping at AJ's. Every single item on the shelves is of the highest quality. For Valentines day, because I'm so bad at picking out girly gifts, I let my girlfriend go on a shopping spree at the chocolate counter (among other things)...I'd go back once in a while, but did grimace at the checkout counter when I forked over $125 for three bags of crap...I guess it's back to mayonnaise sandwiches at Neighborhood Market.",1
"Yes, this is an awesome toy store.  Huge selection and a friendly knowledgeable staff.  But the prices... Yikes! I really can appreciate the fact that these are wholesome, well-made toys with a focus on learning rather than supporting the corporate brands and Hollywood characters.  But it is just not practical for your everyday shopping needs.  I recommend it when you want a special or unusual gift or if you have one of those rare children that wants intellectual stimulation more than to impress their friends with the latest electronic gadget or action figure.",0
"This place looks cool inside and has a fun vibe.  

First the downsides: menu can actually be a little overwhelming, you get the impression the staff is overworked/crazy busy (how long does it take to make tea?) to the point where if there are more than four people ahead of you in line, you want to shoot yourself.  Unless you have nowhere to be, ever.  

Upsides: huge selection, fairly helpful staff (paralyzing indecision?  that's what they're there for), ambiance, coolness factor.  

I need to try the food here.",1
"I went here on a Saturday night and sat outside listening to the band playing in the background.  It was part of the Music Under the Stars, or whatever it called, very cool and fun though.  BTW, I see a lot of people commenting on how loud it was, to all you yelpers, take that with a grain of salt, it's a pizza place near a large family residential area on a weekend, what do you expect, I guess it's an expectation thing.  By no means is this going to be a quiet candlelit dinner for two.  It's a classy, family oriented pizza place. 

We ordered the caesar salad and small pepperoni pizza. Very well priced, and the pizza in my opinion tasted delicious.  It seems like everybody has some weird opinion on how good pizza is, and I guess I have a weird opinion as well.  Here goes...the size of the small, is not small it was more like a medium (value! winning!)(sorry lame Charlie Sheen pop culture reference) anyway, it had a faint sweet taste on it which i really like, the cheese was good, not too much sauce, and the pepperonis were very flavorful.  They were the small kind and they were just great.  The Salad was good, salad is salad, it's hard to mess that up.  

We were helped by an awesome bartender/server named Chandler.  Cool guy, really nice, he kept us entertained.  

We'll be back I want to try some kind of meatlovers next time we go there.",1

"We have been meaning to try The Mission for awhile, and we were extremely impressed. We are self-professed foodies, good cooks, etc.
Let's start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time, and that reservation had only been made that day.....surprising, because the place was packed!! Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner. First, the margaritas. ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them. Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole, and this is the best of them. Alfonso suggested a fried pork belly/cola reduction appetizer that I had to be talked into. OMG....heaven, and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet, crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as ""worth it"" if you are balking at the issue of pork belly.
Entree: we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops. Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt. We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed.
Dessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away. The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream. Fried bananas didn't excite me either. Bananas are bananas..... The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner. I feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisine....some citrus sorbet, chocolate-with-red-chile cake, lime cheesecake. At any rate, I still give them the full Monty on stars!!!",1
"I recently picked up a few satin flower arrangements for a fund raiser event. 
In spite of having bought a 'coupon deal' for the store, the owner Rachel was more than willing to give me the best possible pricing and pieces. 

The arrangements were beautiful and she even custom made a couple of them for us. The colors and flowers she uses are very well picked and beautifully arranged. 

I highly recommend Flora Unique.",1
"Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.  

Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.

The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)

The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a ""Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!""

On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing.",1
"Had myself a new york striploin and it was quite good although I do hate paying these kind of prices for steak.  I really thought the vegetables were more special than the steak, but if you compare what kind of quality steak you get here compared to say Donovan's (high quality steakhouse in CA), I've got to say that I like the overall package presented at Keg Steakhouse with respect to the quality and price.",1
"If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place.  Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw.

The dessert is yummy as well.  This is a must try!",1
"I don't have much time to write this, but I do want to say a few things. 

I had four things so far here. My friend and I both enjoyed them immensely. I paid $16 + tip. 

I had the [A1 - Cha Gio - crispy egg rolls ] & [A2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - spring rolls] to start.

Oh man was this delicious. The first thing I loved when I walked in was the ambiance. Dim lit and let the sun do the lighting - very zen - if you're into that. I felt very comfortable here.

They had four sauces on the table. I have no idea what they are, but the one with red pepper flakes and oil -- the darker one -- oh wow. If you like heat added to whatever you're doing -- wow -- this stuff is for you! I loved it. 

Then I went with the Pho tai - sirloin soup. [P2* - Pho tai] - wow - broth was amazing. Everything was. 

For me, enjoying food means I need a few things. 

First - awesome food
Second - ambiance
Third - presentation

They had it all. I was very impressed by place to the plates. Don't change a thing. I hope  your business is very prosperous!",1

"This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to.  I've only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something.  Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins.  Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck. Thats what makes this Subway so great. Everything is in it's place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work.  Absolutely I will go here again, and I can't say that about many Subways unfortunately.",1
"Stopped by one night late, only one guy working, probably the manager/owner based on him being on the phone and looking like he wanted to gtfo dodge attitude and not wearing anything quiznos related like most workers do... 

Food... subpar... it's a chain... it's hard to fuck up... but he did. There was no care in the making of the sub... I pretty much watched him throw it together, run it through the toaster tossed some lettuce on and wrap it up...

I had chips in my hand... wanted a meal... he didn't ask and just rang it up w/o the drink... I asked what size cup to grab and he said ""oh you wanted a drink?""  Of course I wanted a fucking drink... I just stared at him like wtf man?  Told him to keep his drink cause he'd have to re run my card...  

srsly it's a chain that gives you all the stuff and training to make a sandwich like the other 1000's of quiznos around the country... and you can't do it. If you hate customer service don't buy a franchise sandwich shop.

Two stars... lucky it isn't one. I'm out",0
"I'm so happy these guys are here. I work next door at Gangplank, and the previous sandwich shop in this location was okay, but really started to slide downhill. Planet Sub totally renovated the place (looks great), breathed new life into it, and came out swinging with a diverse and tasty menu. You can really tell they're working hard to make this a great experience, and the sandwiches I've tried so far have been excellent. Look forward to going back soon!",1
The noodles are delicious here. I had the vegetarian spicy noodle. It doesn't come with anything but noodles and the sauce. It would be great if they could add some veggies in there though. So you chose the type of noodle you want and then the flavor. The prices are super cheap and the service is fast. The portions are huge and I could have eaten the whole plate if I didn't stop myself. I am curious to know if they use MSG because it was that hard to stop eating.,0
"I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering I have recently bestowed it as ""My Favorite Restaurant"" - that's a big title to carry. 

I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it. 

Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its), their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh, and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to. 

The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange. 

I love everything about this restaurant - salsas, food, drinks, atmosphere, prices, entertainment (on Wednesday!) - they just need to get rid of that damn giant, ugly, silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar.",1
"In the world of Mongolian BBQ near my work, there are 2 contenders:  Stir Fry Paradise and AJ's Mongolian (formerly and possibly partially still YC's...).  I prefer Stir Fry Paradise because it has never been incredibly packed, and their meat resembles meat and not frozen tubes of meat shavings.  The small ""bonus"" buffet offers more food if you aren't crippled by all the food you crammed into your bowl.  I like the cream cheese wonton triangles, they rock the body that rocks the party.  

Yeah, they are a little pricier if you tack on a soda.  Just drink  water and then tweet to the world how progressive and off the grid you are by not being a ""soda drinker"".  I haven't quite gotten my ""sauce mix"" down yet, but that will come in time.  That's the beauty of these places, if your food is bland then the only person you have to blame is yourself and your lack of sauce mixing artistry.",1
Very nice place and delicious food!,1
"We had a mixed experience at Happy Hour (HH) and dinner.  Quick summary follows.  

Hits:

+ Food was tasty.

+ Ambiance was nice.

Misses:

- Waitress was never able to bring the ""last call"" round of HH she offered.  No explanation or apology.  

- Asked if I ""minded"" anchovies on my salad.  I said ""no,"" but didn't realize there would be an upcharge until the final bill came.

- While in the bathroom, observed one of the staff go straight from the stall (not the urinal) to the Kitchen.  No hand-washing, not even a pause by the sink.  

¡Buen apetito!",0
"I had dinner at the Thai Rama two days ago. It wasn't an awful dining experience, but I'm not sure I would go here again. 

My friend and I ordered the egg rolls (sorry, I don't remember the Thai name), and they were okay. Two pieces, small (but the price was $2, so what did I expect?), and an average filling - something I would expect from frozen egg rolls.

We're both vegetarians and were happy to see a vegetarian section in the menu, but were slightly disappointed with the options. Three of the items included oyster sauce, and the other three were either vegetarian fried rice or red/green curry vegetables. I ordered the green curry vegetables (medium hot), and my friend ordered the red curry vegetables (mild - and she stressed MILD). We waited 20 minutes for our dinner to arrive. I didn't mind my dish - it was waaaaay spicier than medium, but I don't mind a little heat. The sauce was very runny, and the vegetables were soggy and looked they had been sitting in the sauce for quite a while. My friend didn't like her dish at all, mostly because it was quite spicy for being a mild dish. We spent $25 total, and I'm not sure it was worth it.

The service was slow, but the waitresses were very friendly. Overall, I would probably not recommend this restaurant to a friend.",0
"Why oh why can't there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents I've been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me. 

I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good.",1
"In here for a sec but everyone seemed to be having a good time!  Live D.j. and enough room to be who u wanta be on the dance floor... there was poker going on in the corner and with a nice sized crowd. I liked the bartender chick, and she was fast for being the only bartender in there, and very nice.",0
Great atmosphere and food. We keep coming back!,1
Yum!  The toasted barley app is delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger. Both of the sandwiches were outstanding. The service was great too. We will definitely go back.,1
"Amazing. Just stopped for snacks, had the fake crab rangoons and samosas. Very good. Will mos def come back to dine, hopefully several times, when in town. 

Love that they sell Diaya in the cooler and other lovely products, books and junk foods!",1
"I ate here last week and I really enjoyed the burger, fries and decor in this place. I've always thought there is only so much you can do to gussy up a burger and fries. The Zinburger and double truffle fries with aioli had some unique ingredients and tasted great (love the onions caramelized in Zinfandel.) The meat used in the burger is fresh and high quality and they cook it to your specification. Ya you're going to pay more but for $15-20 you're getting a much nicer product than the typical $10 bar burger with fries.",1
"I don't usually write reviews very often (in fact ever).  But I felt that the 4.5 stars does not currently reflect my previous sushi experience here.  

First off, the service here was really good.  The waitress was really nice, very prompt and courteous and provided the food quickly. 

The food itself, was prepared well, I usually eat a lot of nigiri and the pieces are ok in amount of fish, the rice was packed well and the quality of the fish was good.

The major downside in my opinion is that its pricier than I expected.  I wish Yelp would provide ""2.5 dollar signs"".  Granted, I did not come for ""Happy Hour"" which ends relatively early at 5pm.  I go to a lot of sushi restaurants and for the amount of fish provided, I would have expected it to be cheaper.

Also, the edamame cost $$.  Even the miso soup is not complimentary.  Considering the above average price, I've been to too many other places that have the same price, same quality, and provided the necessities for free.  Oh, I even forgot that a bowl of white rice for my child was even a charge.  

So, the nickel and dime of things I would have expected compounded with the surprisingly above average price, I can only say that Yen Sushi was ""ok"".  The other two people in my party (minus the children) also agree.",0
"""The Pilgrim"" represented everything Thanksgiving. Turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing, and onions  all in a crust. It was served with a side of cranberry sauce, and red wine gravy. I loved it. 

It's a must try if you're around ASU. The only thing is that it's really small, but you should be fine sitting at the bar.",1
"Only went to the downstairs bar, but cannot wait to return!  Very cool with the rock and copper features and leather couches.  We sat at the bar and were served drinks that you pour yourself.  Is this a new trend?  He gave us little glass bottles of tonic and coke with little spoons to stir our drinks with.  Those little spoons were so cute I was almost tempted to put them in my purse.  If another couple hadn't been hogging the fireplace the whole time, we would have sat there.  Maybe next time.  We'll try to food too.",1
"i visited on jan 19 and ordered the thai basil (their signature dish) with calamari, which had a very unique flavor that was a bit masked by the spiciness. i'm a wimp when it comes to spices, and i was overwhelmed by the medium i ordered. though the dish was very good, it was, for a dish dish consisting mostly of vegetables, on the scant side for 11.95. 

my friend ordered a curry, and it was a sizable portion, presented in a clay pot. i sneaked a bite, and it was very good too.

the place is comfortable and intimate, with booths and tables, and the wait staff is very friendly.",0
"What a find.  In a strip mall nestled between a bank, clothing stores and overnight shipping is Giuseppe's.  A family owned and run establishment where byob is the way to go.  This reminds me of countless small mom and pop's back in The City.  The staff is friendly, the portions sizable and the check small to medium.  In fact, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this restaurant before.  Whether on a date, or with the family, I've never had a bad experience in the dozens of times I've been there.  From the veal parmagian (sp?) to the eggplant, from the fettucine to the spaghetti and meatbeals... mama mia.  It is a small venue, with very limited outdoors seating during good weather.  And the locals know about it, so it gets pretty packed Thursday through Sunday.  The salads and appetizers are delicious as well... If this restaurant had been in Spinal Tap, it would get ""an eleven""...",1
We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome. I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was. I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience. This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day. My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back!,1
"My sweet hubby brought me here for my b-day the other night.  Note, this is a Scottsdale 5 star, otherwise known as a Chicago, California, or New York 4 star rating.  This may possibly be my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Amazing food.  Unpretentious and cozy atmosphere.  Got the steak frites.  Asked for veggies instead of frites and ended up with steak green beans.  It was excellent.  We asked for a smooth red wine.  I had possibly my second best red wine ever.  We also ordered a scallop appetizer and the escargots.  Both were cooked almost to perfection - however lacking in salt for my personal preference, which is an easy fix.   I would definitely go back.  Don't recommend this for large parties.  However, it is the perfect place for smaller, intimate parties.",1
"Loooove this place! Yes it's pricey, but good sushi usually is. The guys making the rolls were friendly. The atmosphere is nice. Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldn't get enough of the spicy shrimp roll. Seriously, try it. You won't be disappointed!",1
"My wife and I came here to see what they had to offer. As we had bought a king size bed frame and bed. However because we can still cancel our order and felt our decision was on the whim as the mattress we originally purchased was on sale from another furniture store.

We came here to see what other options we had to choose from. Upon entering I already was prepared for the sales man attack, however we were taken back by how friendly and non pressuring environment we entered in. George the salesman was very informative on the beds, and was trying to gauge what we were looking for. After narrowing down to 3 beds another couple came in, we told him we can attend to them while we continued to drill down. He checked on us a few times and answered a few questions we had, but was not breathing down our necks. 

The products: They had a good selection of beds for all prices ranges and were well organized based on color piece on the mattress. The sales were nice as well as the options in the clearance section which seemed very reasonable.

In the end we ran to the other furniture store to see the bed we originally purchased which we liked very much and kept our original decision. If we didn't find the bed prior Mattress Firm would have easily won our business and would recommend them to others.",1
"This is definitely the best place for breakfast in Wickenburg.  Loved all the cowboy decorations, photos of actors from the early Westerns days, and the ""cuckoo"" clock which didn't cuckoo but instead whinnied like a horse.  Clean premises, very friendly staff, excellent service, and breakfast for the group came out in due time. Call ahead for groups of more than 4, as most of the booths are small.",1
"They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods. They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter. Maureen the checker, Kathy in vitamins, and Daniel & Paula in the Deli are all exceptional- go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help.",1
"Pretty ok place, right in the thick of it, I saw 3 separate arrests while drinking beer on the patio.  They have a couple different 4 Peaks Brews.  Those facts alone made it a successful endeavor.  Did I mention it was 4pm on a Friday?",0
Decent airport with a limited variety of food choices and a strange layout. It feels a little outdated but I was only at the airport for a quick layover.,0
"First off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all.   I called to consign my furniture and when I asked her about some info on the store,, she said "" do you want to consign your table or not!"".  Quite rude.  That was a turn of for me.....
The next day I went in the store for some info but when I entered I knew this wasn't the right fit for my Robb & Stucky table.  The place had older style furniture..dated couches, florals, mauves.  There was one accessory that I would  buy in the whole store.  

Needless to say, I won't be coming back or consigning my table or anything else...rude stuff + gross stuff...what more can I say!",0
"Games- great.
Game prices- decent.
Food- Edible, but nothing to write home about.
Food prices- WAY too high for the quality.
Bar- Weird. The 1st bar Ive heard of that doesnt carry Baileys or some type of Irish cream liqueur.
Drinks- Meh, stick w/ beer.
Service- Also weird. Ive had the best service here when its crazy busy and the absolute worst when my friends and I are the only people to be waited on.

A good time, if youre going for games and basic drinks.",1
"I have been here countless times since my last review and found myself here for a quick drink and some appetizers last night.  I took a huge hiatus as I was in Michigan for a month and then have been crazy busy since arriving back in Phoenix and transitioning into a new job- I was sad because I thought they would've forgotten me.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not forget me at all.  I love that!

We grabbed some brews and shared the patatas bravas (a personal favorite) and the mushroom appetizer.  The mushroom appetizer was heavy on the cheese but still a tasty bite.  The patatas bravas really never fail- they remind me of my Mom's version of french fries.  

I'd highly recommend this place for a date- it seems to pay off in more ways than one.  Always great service and interesting eats- still lovin' Tuck Shop for being in my neighborhood!",1
"""Tanked Fish"" is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood and we frequent it often. 

Rolls are of a great quality and there are some rather unusual and pleasantly different ones there. Price is very reasonable. And drinks selection, if not overly excessive, is ""Cool"".  Place is not riddled with kids, like many other places are, and you can actually kick back and have a conversation there.
One one of the weekday evenings they have this special thing where you can request your musical choice from this rather large list. Its real neat. What else is neat - their happy hour on Wednesday (I am not sure what day exactly to be honest. Call them if you really want to know.), when drinks, starters and most rolls are 1/2! This really makes a huge difference. 

I gave this place 4 starts. This is pretty much as high as it goes for me for this. 

""I like""

"My wife and I went here and sat on the patio near the canal. The temperature was perfect for being outside and the view of Camelback was sublime. My only complaint about the seating was it was difficult to read our menus when we were there in the evening.
Our waiter was friendly and helpful.
The chicken salad sandwich I had was very good and my wife loved the burger she ordered.
All in all a very nice and relaxing Sunday evening dinner.",1
"I tried Narai when my family was in town; everyone enjoyed their meal. They have a wide variety of Thai food and sushi and a full bar. Our servers were very attentive. 

I had the tofu pad thai with medium spice (which is still pretty spicy). It had a nice flavor to it. and enough of a portion to take leftovers home for lunch. My sister really enjoyed her papaya salad and thai soup and my parents liked the cashew chicken - the sauce had a great flavor. 

There aren't a ton of Thai restaurants in North Scottsdale... I'd say this one is a very solid pick.",1
This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =),1
Delishhhh... blueberry crepes w/cream cheese!,1
This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to.  I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off.  This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD 's for the road trip.  We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it.,1
"Yeah it was good. My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly ""side dish"" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said ""he"" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says ""yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.  Fun night.",1
"When my mom suggested we eat at a simple casual Mexican restaurant for her birthday/my brother's grad school graduation celebration, I was a little surprised. She herself has only been in one other Mexican restaurant years ago and loved it...no wait, I take that back. She's been in one other one but did not enjoy it as much as the first time. Eh. Anyhoo...My brother suggested Arriba because it is one of his favorite restaurants. (Note: I keep encouraging him to yelp about his favorite places in Phoenix since he lives there.) 

It was not terribly crowded for a Saturday afternoon, which was nice. I was pleased to learn that they have brunch options which is served until 4 PM on the weekends, if I recall. Up until the restaurant, I had trouble deciding what I wanted to eat since I had gained some weight being around family....eh, that happens right? I opted for the make your own omelet, and it came with beans and some potatoes. The potatoes were bland and needed a little salt for flavor. My dad who has never stepped in a Mexican restaurant, only because he is not a huge fan or an expert in Mexican cuisine, enjoyed his carne asada and rice. His plate was CLEAN! He did say he would come back again, and for my dad to say that is a good thing. My mom and brother shared some a lot of food, but honestly I was not paying attention to what they ordered. Oh and for dessert? We had 3 orders of the flan. I still stand by that my mom makes the best leche flan ever, but the one at Arriba was just as tasty. I think the cinnamon sprinkles help. ;-)  

Overall, I would have to say that we as a family enjoyed this place. Sadly, our trip in Phoenix was too short otherwise we would have gone back for at least a second round. We were seated right away and had great service. 

PS: The little to-go menus at the front are slightly different than the big menus at the table. I only know because my dad wanted to order something else from the small menu, and apparently it is only served during the week.",1
"My wife and i just dined at this restaurant. I am a chef and must say that Chef Chris's concept is one I have not experienced.The food was outstanding, service excellent and the decore was creative,down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on.  Our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice.  What really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course. Being a chef I had to share a neat appetizer, that i recently found, using a baby corn shoot!  Chef keep up the suberb Cafe Monarch Bravo.",1
"Excellent food! I do say the service isn't always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations. Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad! Not what you'd expect out of a typical boring salad! Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor.",1
I was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate.  They put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome.  I wasn't in the mood for BBQ at the time but so I ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli.  I love the healthy options.  Thanks to Red Robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge.  Just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because it's easy to blow it...especially with the desert menu!!,0
"I just moved to AZ from Honolulu with my bf and found this to be a great breakfast / brunch place. They do close at 2:30pm.

On my last visit, I ordered the amazing ""2 for you""! You get the choice of a half sandwich & either soup or salad for $7.95...WHAT A DEAL!! I ordered the  Monterey Club & the No. 5 Chinese salad. What an amazingly refreshing lunch! I highly recommend this day cafe, this may not be the best review, but if you stop by the line may sway you:)",1
"I received a buy one entree, get one free coupon for joining their fan club membership so my son and I went this morning for breakfast. Got there around 9am. Greeted and seated immediately in a nice booth. Waitress was quite knowledgeable and took our order after giving us time to peruse the menu. I ordered the Country fried steak and eggs which comes with OJ, country potatoes and toast as did my sons breakfast which he ordered the standard bacon and eggs with an extra egg. We both agreed that the breakfast was OK, both our potato sides were cold. I had a small thick dollop of gravy on my country fried steak, which was quite good but had to ask for extra gravy. Put in a serving bowl it was so thick it wouldn't pour so I used a spoon. I spread it on my Country fried steak with a butter knife much like you would a piece of toast. Weird! Watch out for the coffee. If you are offered flavored coffee it is extra. Hidden charges for everything. In other words, even with the coupon the total came to almost $20.00. for 2 average breakfasts. (tip, cancer donation, etc.) I had to do a double take on the check to see if they included the coupon. Nothing really bad but nothing really good either. I should have known better! Probably not coming back. My son seconds the motion.",0
"There's a lot to love about The Mission.  The experience comes so close to 5-star that it makes me want to nit-pick about all the tiny things that fall juuuust short so they can fix them for my next visit!

The Bar: What a lovely, refreshing Basil margarita!  It was just sweet enough without being syrupy.  But bartender, why is getting a recommendation out of you like pulling teeth?

The Food: Excellent table-side guacamole; it lived up to the very high expectations set by all the other reviewers.  My dinner partner's Hangar Steak was very juicy for such a thin cut and the dressing from the tomatillo salad give the whole dish a tangy, acidic bite.  My Chorizo Porchetta was very unique and flavorful, but a little more sauce would've saved it from being slightly dry.  I love though how the star of the entrees really is the meat here, the portions were generous and the sides were an accompaniment, not a competitor.
***Almost forgot about the pumpkin bread pudding we shared!  He loved the scotch-carmel sauce which I thought was too sweet.  I loved the moist, fragrant bread which he thought was missing pumpkin-y spice.  To each their own!

The Atmosphere:  It's a gothic romance come to life with beautiful dark metal chandeliers, warm, glowing salt bricks, and dim lighting.  I just wish the table of 6 old men talking golf wasn't sooo close.  A little more room between tables would complete the intimate decor.

The Service:  I have no complaints here!  Our server was excellent and never overwhelming, the lady who made our guac was all charm, and kudos to the chef who sent us complimentary street corn (yummy by the way).  

A note on the street corn: I felt like this was a dish that would've won the Top Chef competition where they had to re-invent convenience store food.  The grilled, slightly salty & crunchy corn topped with creamy spicy cheese sauce beats any AM-PM nachos I've ever had! :)

Lots of wonderful food still to try here.  I will be back very soon for brunch with mom!",1
"Some amazing friends of mine surprised me and set up a whole birthday dinner at Jug 'n Barrel! This was my first time here and was shocked at how cute the place was. Even in a strip mall it actually had a fireplace which gave it a very cozy feel. The wine list is great and not too intimidating. We had a great server who even put together a wine flight to match my sweet tooth. The only thing that knocks a star (More like 1.5 stars) off the rating is the completely average food. We had a group of about 12 and ordered several appetizers and all of us ordered entrees. I don't think any of us were blown away by our meals. 

Although I will not return for a meal, I would return for wine with friends.",1
Have tried this place a few times now we sometimes order it for everyone at work. My impression is that its a step up from Taco Bell.,0
"If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only. Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.  

The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree.",0
"They had amazingly quick service during lunch! The servers were VERY polite, almost to the point of being obnoxious. I ordered the daily special--bacon cheeseburger--which came out hot, fresh, and delicious, though the fries were heavily over-salted. Our drinks were also quickly refilled without us asking, which was nice but unfortunately their tea basically tasted like water. Overall, it was a good experience and I would come back again.",1
"Ahhh.... Whole Foods, John Mackey's little baby he has turned into a behemoth within the industry. I am so torn by Whole Foods, of course most everything is more expensive. This could stem from when Mackey started the business as a democratic socialist and was not making any money, yet people were complaining about pay and high prices so he then turned into a free market libertarian - you can blame your high prices on that if it makes you feel better. Mackey is also a Vegan, but has said if he didn't sell animal products it would be bad for business(if the business even existed), yeah I get it, but I don't like it. Does anyone even care about the innard workings of the company CEO of the store they love/hate? Ok I'll cut this short.

This Whole Foods is an older store, not the real old school hippy-esque store, but it's nothing like the newer flagship stores around the country(like the one on Mayo). This obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller, albeit more ""quaint"" store. If I go to the Mayo store I am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because I was lost in a trance ""browsing""; this makes my girlfriend very angry.

I don't buy all my groceries here because I don't think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you can't find anywhere else(Trader Joe's, Sprouts, Sunflower, etc). The Vegan/Vegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores, they simply carry all the latest and greatest - it may not be the cheapest, but they carry it. 

One last item, and this is for pizza loving vegan fools - Whole Foods was one of the first places to carry Daiya cheese. They actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section, but they also have it available at the deli. The usual counter worker isn't that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesn't make the pizza any less tasty. You can get one of their ""surfboard"" pizzas which will feed 2 for 2-3 days with a couple of toppings with Daiya cheese for $15.99. This may be the best deal going at Whole Foods and make up for that $8 bar of dark chocolate you just bought.",1
"Oh Man. This is not the place I imagined I would assign my first 2-star rating. I woke up as sad and disappointed as I felt last night, leaving the legendary, old school Durant's after an evening of less than mediocre food and terrible service. Sigh.

Honey had a great lunch there a few months back and was excited to impress me with dinner. We saw Durant's listed on Restaurant week and were excited for the excuse to squeeze into one of their comfy booths amidst the bow-tie clad staff and velvet wallpaper. The instant time travel type setting usually makes for an incredible dining experience. Shall I fault the poor rating to their efforts at succumbing to a prix-fixe menu? Perhaps.

Our time at the bar proved to be the best part of the night. Watching the bartender mix the martini's the way my Pops used to was nostalgia at its best. I LOVED that they serve bottles of beer with a toothpick of meat and cheese. That is brilliant. It could transform me into a beer drinker after all. We met up with friends and continued on to the dinner portion of the evening.

Moving on to the booth, our waitress was definitely in the weeds. Having been in her shoes before, I always try and accommodate the situation. We ordered an appetizer and a few cocktails and waited to order dinner when she seemed able. Appetizer of artichoke dip was yummy. Tortillas and garlic bread and warm, cheesy dip delivered promise.

The limited menu was just that. Okay first course salad/soup options. Main course offered Pot roast, a small steak or chicken fried steak. Stewed steak, grilled steak or fried steak. Really? Your menu is impressive...if you really don't want to participate in Restaurant week, then don't. 

Honey ordered the chicken fried steak as a continuation of the old school vibe. I ordered the trout off the regular menu after C pointed out the fish option. J ordered the cfs too. 

Food took a bit, but we had good conversation flowing, so it wasn't a problem. Salads and soup were fine. Main course arrived and we were all a bit surprised by the size of the fried steak. I guess when you think of this meal from the past, it encompasses half the plate and is oozing with country gravy. This steak was the size of a burger and had a dollop of thick gravy-esque goo on the top. Garlic mashers were appropriately placed. 

My trout was supposed to be topped with a lemon caper sauce but instead it was slathered with a gravy that hinted at lemon and was all wrong for a fish. The trout was pain-fried and should there have been a light sauce, it would have been good. But the fried fish with the gravy was just so not good. 

The fried steak too, so not good. Mashers achieved an appropriate level of goodness, but you really don't want mashed potatoes to lead your dinner. 

We were devastated. 
The whole experience was so not what we came for or expected. I do want to give Durant's another chance and order a big, juicy steak and let them wow me like they do to so many, but it will be a while before our trek downtown includes a walk through their kitchen.",0
"I came here by myself because non of my fellow conference peeps wanted to walk 10 minutes to dinner.  I'm glad I made that short walk to here because I enjoyed eating their prime rib.  It was cooked just right and it was rested correctly.  Needless to say, I was so stuffed that my 10 minute walk became a 15 walk back to the hotel.",1
"Totally a locals hangout.

This very unpretentious wine bar is a favorite.  The owner, Darlene, has a great selection of wines from smaller labels for you to try.  If you're not sure what to get they'll help you find a bottle in your price range.  They've got the cheap stuff all the way to the $80+ range (if you feel like spending some money).

You can buy a bottle at retail, open it up at their bar and enjoy it with a nosh.  Lots of smaller appetizers (cheese and crackers, etc).  Or, order by the glass/flight from their bar.

Checkout their website before you go.  Or if you live in the area, subscribe to their email newsletter.  There is something different going on every day (live music, tastings, specials, etc.)",1
So I just called to book a class for me and a friend from a Groupon we bought. The classes for the next 2 weeks were all booked :(. I called and spoke to a very pleasant Paul who said they are extending this offer for a month. Yippee. You rock and we can't wait to try our hand at this exciting craft!! Huge props for Great customer service!!,1
"In times of big corporations it was nice to find such a warm and friendly coffeehouse in the valley. It is just a great place to hang out, set-up your laptop or read a book. I thoroughly enjoyed my Joltachinno, a much better version of the Starbucks frappacino which is just too sweet. 
We came back another day for lunch and all I can say is yum! I have never had food like this at a coffeehouse.
Amazingly, for our second time there, they recongnized us! WOW!  I am glad that I have found my new hangout when I come to the valley!",1
I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw that Country Market had a deli here. I picked up a roast beef sandwich and some potato salad. When I was eating it my friend said it sounded like I was having a mouth orgasm because I moaned after every bite! If  you live in the area and haven't been here yet try the sandwiches they're great.,1
"Finally! A non-corporate place in Chandler that doesn't try too hard, yet knows how to please with high-end ingredients: local and organic when possible!

I ordered the Chef's Burger from their lunch menu. Grass-fed, ground in-house 8 oz burger with arugula, Gruyère, and onion rings.  I personally would have liked the arugula melted under the Gruyère or tossed with the Russian dressing.  It was too ordinary undressed on the top bun. But, it IS the Chef's Burger and if that's how he likes it, then that's the way it should be enjoyed. Oh, and the onion rings are awesome.  

The service was genuine and friendly. The food came out reasonably fast and HOT!

It would have been nice if you could hear the music...it was just too quite.

I will definitely come back and try other menu options and I highly recommend BLD!!",1
"One of the perks to being an only child, is ""me"" time. There is something special about having time to yourself, when the only obligation you have is to check in on Yelp, leave a quick tip, and grab a lemonade from the mall because it is 109 degrees outside.

Yesterday was that day. I had stumbled across The Art of Shaving. I've been in their stores in other cities before. Of course I have...because if you look at any of my pictures, you will realize a couple things: 1. I'm vain. 2. I'm hairless.

As soon as you step foot into this store, you are in a true gentleman's club. Not the kind that will take all your dollar bills. You won't make it rain here.

This is the ultimate shaving store. Soaps, creams, blades, razors, balms, brushes, and mugs. You name it, they have it.

The staff knows what they are talking about. I explained to them that I have a very old safety razor and a brush. Both were passed down by my Grandfather who passed away when I was a teenager.

They didn't pressure me into buying ANYTHING, although I did end up leaving with some shaving cream. They even gave me a proper demo on how to use it properly with my brush. I've been used to shaving soaps and the usual aerosol creams....so the little tutorial was nice.

Also, there is a master barber in the back of the house that does straight razor shaves, haircuts, and men's facials.

Remember earlier when I said that ""me"" time is a perk? This is the best place to spend it if you are a dude.

If you are a woman, buy your man, or your man-friend a gift from here. This place is simply amazing.

One last warning. The store is pricey. but worth every single penny.",1
"They were absurdly busy. I had a bar's eye view of the care that goes into the $3.95 1/2 dozen oysters. I would not order them myself. Dinner felt rushed, I didn't feel like a very valued client, and the poor gentleman next to me waited at least 25-30min for his 1/2 dozen oysters (carelessly drained of their delicious fluids).

My dinner was good, but relied heavily on it's fat content to carry it's flavor. My cocktails were good, I would come back for those.

It took another 10min just to pay my tab after I had finished. My dishes were cleaned up by a bartender who looked like he just run a marathon, dripping with sweat. Not exactly how I like to finish my evening.

Thanks, but no thanks Pappadeaux.",0
"I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food.",1
"I am a G-Spot addict!  Had to limit myself from going every week though.  

Took the hubby there after a date night the other weekend.  It was his first time to try gelato.  He's a ColdStone guy 100% and he really enjoyed the Tiramisu gelato!  

The focaccia flatbread is awesome!!!  And I would post a photo of the Focaccia Flatbread I got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad, but (in the words of LOLCat) ""I eated it"" and forgot to take a photo first.   :)

My favorite salad dressing is the champagne vinegarette!  
The mintchip gelato is freaking awesome!  
The stracciatella gelato mixed with mint - even better!!!  

G-Spot is so awesome, that I just walked back over and got my Mint / Stracciatella combo.  Baby C wanted something sweet!   :D",1
"I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there, your service has been better, the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect, I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!! 

If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm, I would come eat you now.",1
"Decided to roll the dice on a Saturday night and try this place everyone's been raving about. Despite showing up at prime time to a packed house we got a table relatively quickly. 

The food was delicious and came out promptly. I didn't any problems with the wait staff like others have expressed. The presentation was a little more than expected without feeling pretentious or like I had to keep my elbows off the table; not that I'm a slob.

Didn't get a chance to make it upstairs but the main dining and bar areas were well-lit but still cozy and had a simple, modern feel.

Good place for a date or toss back a few cold ones with your crew. St. Francis is definitely on my list now.",1
"I had to try it.  I had to see what became of the space that was once the finest restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  The design of J & G made me think ""Really?"".  As Mary Elaines the space was elegant, regal, sophisticated, refined.  As J & G the space feels like a sleek flashy Vegas restaurant.  I am still recovering from that shock.  I was there to give it a try.  So here you go.

Tasting Menu

Tuna Tartar (Delicious)
Parmesan Risotto (needed salt, but good)
Sea Bass (Excellent, so moist)
Beef (Good, but excellent tasting steak sauce was ice cold)
Chocolate Cake (Wow!!!)

Cocktail/ Wine

Sidecar (awesome)
Some sort of big red wine.

Our waiter was good and explained the menu very well.  There were some errors is service so I had to keep reminding myself this is not Mary Elaines.  Its a steakhouse.",1
"A friend was visiting from out of town and we decided we wanted a pampering experience.  So, rather than go to my neighborhood mani/pedi place, we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a (we hoped) luxurious pedicure.  This place looked very promising, and the lady at the front really talked them up, so we took the plunge.  

Everything seemed promising . . . we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us.  Then . . . disappointment.  The pedicure was nothing I couldn't get for half the price, the massage chairs just vibrated, my feet were still a little rough afterward, and the paint job wasn't even that good.  

Basically, this was VERY overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure.  We still enjoyed ourselves, but agreed we would never go back there.",0
"It's 4:00 am on a Friday, you've just finished listening to awesome music and drinking too much, you're starving and want some good comfort food to fill your gut and soak up that alcohol..... enter Jerry's.

The place was open.  The place was clean.  The food was good.  The service was great.  The prices were great.  WAY better than a Denny's, better than most diner's I've been to, actually.

I had ham and eggs and the plate was delicious.  The ham steak was gigantic, the eggs perfect, and hash browns were done just right... crispy and good.",1
"Great hotel- though it's more of a condo. Got a room for my mom this past weekend and she liked it so much she didn't want to leave the resort. Our room was very large. Had s dining room, living room, fully stocked kitchen, 2 patios, and a large bedroom and bathroom. There's like 3 or 4 pools in the resort, a nice restaurant and bar with live music. It's  Close to Desert Ridge, and the Quarter so good location for out of own visitors. Got an amazing price through hotwire. Service was also outstanding. Nice job Xona!",1
"The venue, which is close to campus, usually gets all the big shows from Hot Hot Heat to Incubus to Mickey Avalon to Brand New. The great thing about the venue is that you can stand almost anywhere and still be able to see the band. There's a big bar inside with friendly bartenders, although the well drinks can be a little pricey. There's usually a hot dog vendor outside and most of the bands performing can be found walking around before and/or after their sets, making it easy to mingle. The downside about the Marquee is that parking sucks. There's not a ton of parking in the club's lot and the nearby lots usually fill up fast so be prepared to trek down Mill to get to and from your car if you don't arrive early.",0
"YogurtBuilderz provides a good sized dining area with many choices of yogurt and toppings. I did find it a little difficult to locate when I attempted to find the building - it is tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall parking lot. It was dark, late at night and took a few passes around the parking lot to zero in on the location. The staff was very friendly and the place was busy even for a Sunday night. For the staff and selection I give it a 3 star rating. It was good, but I didn't find it any different than the growing list of competition. 

I know this place is popular and self-serve frozen yogurt establishments are all the rage now. The economic model is great - you pay by the ounce and have your choice of any variety of yogurt and any topping available. Customers have the opportunity to build it as they wish, which allows those with specific tastes to have their wants fulfilled more so than a traditional store offering the generic selection of choices. 

All of that in mind, I don't like it (the industry). Too many choices creates an opportunity for indecision and slows down the lines as people stand around wondering what to put in it next. For those new to the game, you can create something that turns out to be rather nasty - for example, the white chocolate sauce is really very sweet and I find if mixed with other toppings makes it almost unbearable. The other reason I do not like these places is that I do not like to pay for food that I then have to make and serve myself. I go to restaurants and pay for a meal rather than cook it at home because a) I don't like doing it and b) I am horrific at it. While frozen yogurt does not require much preparation, there is still some assembly required. If I am paying, I prefer to have it built for me. But I realize I am in the minority. As popular as these chains are becoming I wouldn't be surprised to see ""FroYo"" overtake ""unfriend"" as word of the year in 2010.",0
"I'm sad to say that I wasn't in love with MacAlpine's.  The fact that the building has never been restored is cool, in a dirty kind of way.  The floors will never be clean enough, because they are so old.  That may seem ridiculous, but cleanliness is important to me when I'm eating somewhere.

Our server was odd, but helpful and attentive.  We spent a good amount of time oogling the random items displayed throughout and were entertained with our surroundings.

The food is where I saw the problem- my Mac Cheeseburger was bland and tasteless.  My broccoli and cheese soup was below average.  I wasn't impressed one bit.

We ended up having dessert.  I opted for a single scoop of Chocolate Malt Krunch, which I'd never had before and didn't love (total personal preference as my friend loved it).  MacAlpine's is cool, but I think purely as a place to get something sweet.",0
"I was one of a party of 13 for a birthday party on Saturday night.  Yep, I was odd man out again and in more ways than one as I will note in a bit.  We got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus.  Most of the folks there had been there several times before.  Everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so I ordered fettuccine Alfredo ($18.95) with salad and garlic knots.  I know it's un American not to be a fan of pizza and wings.  Their antipasta arrived and I sipped on my beer.  Then the pizzas came, then the wings followed by my pasta.  Somehow my order got separated from the rest and I had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last.  The side salad wasn't earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread.  The pasta was delicious.  I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings.  Both were really good, the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust.  The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings.  I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me.  After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of.  If you followed along, you will note I ate a lot of different stuff and I paid for it for several hours afterward.

For a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late.  I just had the one beer (25oz) but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception (weak) all were done well.

This is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more TVs than I have seen outside of Vegas.  The original space which is sort of set off from the rest of the area has pool tables and darts.  There is a good sized outdoor area too.",1
Friendly and knowledgeable staff! They even have a nutritionist on site which shows their dedication to promote healthy living! I think it's great that they make the food daily and have appropriate portion sizes.  I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because they didn't have as many vegetarian/vegan meals as I would have liked. What I did purchase though tasted delicious! I look forward to going back and checking out their meals again!,1
"This is my favorite Chipotle to go to because it's the closest one to my work. I call in orders all the time and the staff always has it ready to go. Even when I don't have a pick up order they always move quickly to get everyone through the line, which is great because when I'm hungry I want everyone out of my way!",1
"Ye Olde Pipe has a great selection of cigars and a very big walk-in humidor, almost too big. I say that because as I walked around I came across a few boxes of cigars that were way too dry. With that said, I still found SEVERAL cigars that were fresh and moist. What I liked best about Ye Olde was the variety, they had several cigars at all price points, so if you can't afford to smoke an Opus X, they had plenty of cigars for less than $10. 

If you aren't an avid smoker, I don't know if you will get any help because the staff did not seem very friendly or welcoming, but if you know what you want, there is a good chance they have it.",0
"Well my first review of Over Easy; have gone here a few times; only reason I don't go more often probably because of the wait. The food is definately makes me want to return.  The Hopple Popple, the Wolf  Pack, and what I had today, the Loco Moko (only criticism is the rice); great lemonade (when I used to drink lemonade) and the hash browns & they have tater tots!!! I'll be back; when I can get up early...",1
"I started a new job and the bosses brought us here for lunch.  It was ok.  I got a lunch combo meal, but I didn't pay.
The service was really great but the food was not.  Just kind of plain.  
It's convenient to work, so I will probably be back, I just won't have very high expectations.",0
John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.,1
"I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and I'm glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once; however, this will also be my last time going there. We'll start from the beginning: 

The atmosphere was nice for the ""jungle"" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!! Not worth it at all! The food was mediocre but left me sick that night. 

Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas...",0
"Very run-of-the-mill, solid, nothing-exciting-or-surprising type of place. It's the kind of restaurant that's not your first choice, but when all your other options are closed, or too far, or too crowded, you come to Village Tavern and you end up not being disappointed.

I was there today and had the $3 mimosas with the crab-cakes benedict. The potatoes that accompany the eggs are way too mealy, but the eggs themselves and the sauce are spot-on. Wished the crab-cake had a bit more flavor.

Bread service is by request only, which I really like.

Our hostess and our server were polite and efficient. 

Overall, a good place to bring mom and dad to on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",0
"I have been going to Postino since it opened. I remember the Matt Diamond era, Susan era and now the Brent Karlicheck era. I really like the evolution as to what it has become.
Now granted, I am personal friends with Brent (and Matt) so I want to disclose this upfront, but I am elated with the new direction of the wine program as I think it is superior to most in its consumer friendly format.
Grab a plate of bruschetta and $5 glass of ABC (anything but Cabernet) at the bar. Ask Brent or the chilled staff to help you pick something great.

Like the mythical Arcas, you can bear the budget bacchanalian orgy right in the heart of Arcadia",1
"I feel sad to write this...but Vincent needs to improve things or his place will be only a past memory.  I'm ok with that based on the dinner I had there recently.
The restaurant was packed...but with people who had Groupons...I only wish I had because my dinner would not have been 177.00.  Too much for a weak and sad plate of out of date food.
We had the Foi Gras, small portion and so/so:(...Duck chimichangas they were decent. The wild boar was a tiny serving...we were fine with that because it was tough and difficult to chew.  It was accompanied with a hospital style vegetable medly of green beans with carrot shreds and minute white rice.  We also had trout..it was covered in a heavy white sauce (French) and had the same veg medly and white rice...seriously like the hospital food...or a big banquet service.  It was edible...but not great...We each had a glass of wine.  No dessert for us...it was hot in there and the arches and decor reminded me of a taco bell.  I wouldn't even go back if it was a free meal:(",0
"3 stars on any given day, my server PAT made this a fun experience and was the extra 2 stars.  Pat is one of the few people in this world who really enjoys being good at what he does.  I asked him, ""how long"" and with much joy he replied, ""I can get your food in 10-15 minutes"".  Sure enough it took 9 minutes.  I value time and in my business my word is everything.  Pat understands this and when I eat here again I will insist on his table.  I recommend you do the same.  ASK FOR PAT!!!

Top notch Pat.  Don't ever change.",1
"They must have renovated this place in the last year. It is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded ""hover over a table to get a seat"" necessity.  It now reminds me much more of the dreaded ""Panera Bread"" chain in California, but the food is still much better and has much less of a ""mass produced"" feeling and taste.

The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared.

I love carbs...Carbs with carbs and a side of carbs.  They serve warm syrup with their pancakes (yum!) and their bread is just amazing.  

The ""side of pancakes"" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent, fluffy, and tasty.  

They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right.

Today, before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshine(well, the other land of that anyway) we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate. I would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends!",1
"It was a rainy Saturday, yes, that's right, it was raining and hot and muggy!  UGH!  But when it rains I just want to go sit in a coffee shop and people watch or just relax a little.  And I don't have a coffee pot at home right now.  Yes, I know, it's somewhat sacriligious for someone such as myself who is a caffine addict.  Sad, but true.  I just needed my fix and it's that time of year people.....the Pumpkin Spice Latte is BACK!!!  HOORAY!!!  It is my all time favorite!!

This is the closest Starbucks to where I live.  Just a few blocks away.  When my friend took me here the first time she told me it was the ""gay"" Starbucks.  Yup, I think that is safe to say.  I'm straight but if I were gay, dang, I'd probably be here more often.  I like this location though.  It never seems to be super busy and there is always a place to sit weather it's inside or out.  It's clean and the staff are friendly.  It also helped that I was cleaning out my wallet and found a Starbucks gift card.  Score!  

There is not much else located near this Starbucks.  The Good Egg, which looks like somewhere I might try, and Jamba Juice but sadly, it looks like just about everything else has closed up in this little strip mall.  Too bad because it must have been a hoppin place a few years back.  

I may have to go back soon......like, today, maybe....I'm getting another craving for my fave PSL!!!  YUM!!  And now they have a PSL Frap!  I have not tried it yet but I will.  Sounds like pumpkin pie through a straw!  Yum-O!",1
"I've been here a couple of times.  The first time was on first fridays.  I expected it to be packed, but I was able to walk right in and be seated.  They had a table reserved and they must not have shown, so we lucked out.  I got the Sante Fe, a roast beef panini, and it was great.  They had some good beers on tap too.  Its a cool little funky place to grab a good sandwhich.  The second time I came here it was after a concert.  There was some horrible band playing that I wish would have shut up so I could hear the people in front of me without having to feel sharp pains in my ear, but the meal was still good and I liked it.  Any place that is open late close to downtown is perfect, especially since the kitchen doesn't close until 12:30",1
"Was there last night and had a good time.  I learned several things:  1.  Charlie's has a cover charge of $3 if you get there after a certain time, I believe this starts at midnight or 1 am.  I got there after 1 am and the place was packed, absolutely packed.  
2.  Yes, in Phoenix, some bars can stay open until 4 am (gasp!).  Yes, I know, it blew me away as well.  
3.  The little Mexican food place attached to Charlie's serves really good food late night, but now I understand why they can't sell water or soda through the inside window to Charlie's customers.  That's because Charlie's wants to charge patrons $2.50 for a bottle of water than the Mexican restaurant sells for $1 outside.  
Other than that, I had a good time.",1
"Christy is an amazing cake artist.  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.  Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.  I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.  If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party, then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company.",1
"I am just providing a review for the Mother and Infant Care Department only, since my wife has just had our second baby delivered here.

We really enjoy our stay at this hospital. The facility is very clean and nice. Room are good size with shower box inside bathroom, so you can take shower during your stay and care for the mom. During the stay, Mom and the caregiver are entitle to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner for free. All you have to do is call and place your orders. The foods are quite quality and the portions are decent. I am really impressed with this.

The nurses are all knowledgeable, caring, and nice. They are always there when you call them and need them. Since this is our second child, it works out perfectly that the nurses only come by when we call them or when they do their routine checks. So, the rest of the time you are left alone to rest. The hospital where my first child was born was different. They let lots of interns and students come to our rooms all the times for training, so we were constantly bothered. 

However in my opinion, if it is your first child, you may find that having people around all the time could help you not to worry too much (since we all know nothing when the first child come).

The reason I didn't give this hospital 5 star is just because our discharge was taking so long. We thought we would be out by 11 AM, but we didn't get out until 3 PM... They said that because it was on Sunday.  I think it make sense.

Overall, I do recommend this hospital for any new mother.",1
"I usually do not write reviews, but was so horrified by my experience I had to. Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend, they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar. As I frequent The Moon often, I was happy to see the bar was busy as well. The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated, as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had. We ordered our drinks, and watched as she broke glass into the ice, knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle. As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face. We decided to order some food, as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point. We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing, as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer. I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food. I'm not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management. Being beyond embarassed for the establishment, I would doubt I will come back, sad as we would frequent the Moon 2-3 times a week. Horrible.",0
"T&S Glass did a wonderful job replacing my car window. They came right to the house within 2 hours of my call, had the window replaced within 30 minutes and treated me like a queen. Frank installed the glass and couldn't have been nicer. Thank you T & S Glass!!",1
"Hidden House has some things you expect in a neighborhood bar: lots of pool tables, giant circular bar, tagged restroom, friendly locals (somehow curious or maybe protective), cheap cocktails and specials on pitchers of beer. Then there's a few things different about this place: an usual mix of suits and sweat pant, old and young, some talented pool players and a really smooth bartender. Located in the ""new"" downtown and within walking distance from my hotel. The walk there and back was actually as much fun as sitting in the lounge, some parts of downtown are stunning especially at night when the lights are on and nobody's ""home"".",0
"freaking huge portions. the sandwiches are super yummy. the french toast, covered in bananas, and that crumbly sugary delicouisness is to die for...and you might unless you jog 10 miles afterwards. but the real treat is the desert counter...oh my god, even to just look at it is an honor. good bang for the buck.",1
"The latest Consumer Report magazine gave this restuarant  a higher point value that Houstons.   We disagree.  They tried to be but couldn't even come close.  We were very disappointed in the lack of service, timing of food, and food. Hostesses were seen drinking from Gatorade bottles from there hostess stand,  Sara our server spent more time chatting with her tables that serving and taking care of her guest.  The manager on duty was checking his telephone and did not check our table.  My chicken was very dry.  Salad and soup were good.  Will not return.",0
"We had a fun, early dinner on the patio here at BoomBozz.  The advertised happy hour specials appeared to be a very good value; my fave was the soft pretzels & cheese.  I also had the wedge salad and it was excellent - they don't skimp on the blue cheese!  My son had the pepperoni pizza and even his discriminating palate was very happy.  A crisp blonde draft (for me) and ice cream (for him) polished us off and we left full & happy.",1
"I actually visited here about 5 months ago, but I liked it so much I figured I should give it a few good words! 

I was at the mall looking for something healthier than a pizza or burger and decided upon this place. It is part of their little slogan after all!

I was not disappointed. I chose the beef kabob with a side of fries and pita bread with a cup of hummus. Everything was positively fresh and absolutely delicious. And the portions were big, too. I didn't think I would be filled up after the meal, but I was stuffed!

The staff was very friendly and cooked everything in a timely manner. I was surprised they weren't getting nearly as much business as the other joints around the food court. They don't know what they're missing!",1
"I've been to almost all of the dog parks in the East Valley and this is definitely one of the best. I drive 5 miles each way daily to go there.  It is by far the largest in Tempe (which is easy because the others are tiny).  It is large enough to accommodate a lot of dogs and people (which there are at peak times), has lots of grass, 2 doggy water fountains so they don't have to drink out of community bowls, trees around the perimeter and a ramada with tables/benches, and other benches located around the perimeter. It is open early in the morning and late at night (there are lights on until 10 PM). There are also city supplied poop bags in dispensers which are usually stocked (although occasionally not, so bringing a bag doesn't hurt).   The people are pretty friendly and the poop  situation (people that don't clean it up) isn't that bad in comparison with many other parks, especially Cosmo and Chaparral. There is only one large section (no small or inactive section), but it seems to work out OK as the dogs aren't overly rowdy or aggressive in general. I've never seen a real fight. There is a sort of walking path around the entire perimeter and many do walk it for exercise.  Overall, a well above average place to take your dog.  

LOCATION:  It's a little hard to find.  Take Kyrene to Carver (halfway between Warner and Elliot).  West on Carver about 2 blocks on the left.  There are other routes, but this is the easiest, unless you're coming from  west of the park.

Anyone is welcome  to contact me for my opinions on the other dog parks in the East Valley.",1
"I would've gone 2 stars if I were more forgiving. I could reason that it was the end of the day, that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through, or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant. But then, I tasted it.

It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and I'm sorry to report otherwise. It's was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up.

The stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like, cheesecake doesn't taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and that's what we mostly ended up with.

The decor didn't add to our experience. Everything is a mint green, but it doesn't come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing.

A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes. We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair.

I very well could have walked into Yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day, with all the factors stacked against them, but I won't be returning to find out if this was the case.",0
"The price is right! 16 bucks for two huge lunches, chips & salsa and two drinks.

If you're looking for upscale, squeaky clean and Scottsdalish, this ain't your place. If you're looking for good Mexican food, at reasonable prices, quick service and great flavor head on over to Carolina's.",1
"Was dragged back here for the first time in a few years. It still sucks. On a Friday night, it's like 5:1 dude to girl ratio. 

Mill Cue Club is probably fine during the day if you actually want to shoot pool. But if you want to see America's future losers, stop in here after sundown.",0
"Some highlights
- Loved the special of the day: red velvet pancakes breakfast with cream cheese topping. YUM YUM YUM
- Corned beef hash is canned and not homemade :( sad face
- Fried Chicken breakfast is a huge portion- tasted really well but definitely sad that they only have sausage gravy. Would love it if they could offer a non pork gravy for the non oink eaters. 

Overall, it was delicious, simple menu, great service (Thanks to Waitress Kelly she was really nice) and would much rather support local eateries than Ihop or Denny's anyday.",0
"We stopped in for a snack between lunch and dinner and luckily caught some great HH specials!    The restaurant was virtually empty on a Friday around 3pm, but I didn't mind much as we were in a hurry.  We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed the company of the chef.  

The service was a little bit rock to start off as I think 3 different people tried to take our order, but once it got rolling- we were good to go. 

I had some Sea Bass Nigiri ($3 for 2 pieces), Spicy Tuna Roll ($3-4), Edamame ($1.50), and a wonderful house salad topped with sliced pears and a delicious house dressing ($3).  The fish was all very fresh and clean tasting, but the salad was honestly my favorite!",1
"This review is based strictly on their burgers.  Why?

I had just downloaded the Yelp mobile app and Harlow's was among the top burger search results for Tempe.

I know it's a great breakfast/sandwich/diner type place, but had never thought of it as a burger destination, until the Yelp mobile results.  So I headed on over.  Here's what I found:

It's not a burger destination.   

They offer 5 or so, starting with a basic burger, then different variations based on toppings... green chile, texas chile, bacon focused, etc.  I kept with the basic, plus cheese.  For $8 you get the basic burger with fries, and the variations bump it another dollar or two.  Drinks are extra.  

The menu said theirs were char grilled, but I think they are steam table cooked - no char or smokey taste on mine.  Likewise, I appreciate the regular menu featuring a lot of local product sources,  but I'd guess these are from a frozen patty national vendor.  It wasn't bad, but it reminded me of many tailgates where we bought the big pack of frozen patties and simply reheated and cooked them on a grill.

The service was good and fast.  The fries were decent, though nothing unique (also from a frozen bag?).  The bun was ok, and it came with pickle, onion and lettuce.  But it's still unclear if they made them there or used an external source for the patty.  

Bottom line:  After tip, I paid $12 for a burger, fires and coke.  There was no ""wow moment.""  If they produced something unique it might be worth it.  As it stands, I'd definitely recommend the place for other things, but not burgers. It's not their forte.",0
"The food at Beaver Choice Scandinavian Bistro is delicious; a little unusual, but easily understood. Hearty and reasonably priced. You can find out all about it at azcentral.com in an article by Howard Seftel. Then, after reading this survival guide, you should go and try it.

     Things you will need:
 1. An afternoon or evening with no commitments other than your meal. This could take a long, long time.
 2. A pen and a piece of paper on which to write your order (along with an alternate choice).
 3. Dining companions who all enjoy the same foods and are willing to eat off the same plate.
 4. A snack to tide you over until your food arrives.
 5. A sense of humor (but try not to laugh out loud),

     Here's our experience:

     Four of us entered the small, 20 seat restaurant at 12:10. There were six other people seated at the minimalist glass top tables. A large, and very appetizing looking catering order was taking up another table. We were given menus and told to order at the counter. There were many, many choices of entrees (a few warned that they would take between 20 and 35 minutes to prepare - we avoided those), and each one came with a choice of four side dishes. You can see why a paper and pen might come in handy. Ken went to place our order, but he had to wait for three other people who had arrived before him. It took a while.  Then he was told that my entree choice was not available because they had run out of gravlax. I came up with another selection, and Ken went back to the counter - where another group of people had taken his place and were ordering. Another wait, then my second choice wasn't available either. The sauce had to be reduced and wouldn't be ready until Tuesday. I figured I'd be safe with a third choice of Swedish meatballs, so I yelled over to Ken who saw that each of our orders was being written on a separate piece of paper. Odd.

     We settled in to wait for our food. Our drinks were brought to the table. Sena's eyes popped when she sipped the pitch black coffee. The waitress said it was always that strong and that there was no milk or half and half available, but she could bring out some heavy cream. I noticed that food was coming out of the kitchen painfully slowly. One dish to one table, a while later, one dish to a different table. Companions were left twiddling their thumbs. It so reminded me of Hell's Kitchen - I could hear Gordon Ramsey going ballistic: ""Shut it down you &*#$%!!!!"" . At about 1 PM my Swedish Meatballs were delivered. I put the plate in the middle of the table and invited everybody to dig in. Luckily the servings are large. We finished that off and waited another ten minutes before Sena's chicken schnitzel arrived. That too was shared. At about 1:35 Ken's entree was brought. That left Leon, who had ordered Tilapia. We flagged down the owner and told her that we had a 2 PM engagement and would like our remaining dish. She said she'd look into it, went into the kitchen and was not seen again. A while later another staff member came over and told us that there had been a large catering order, that they had only a six burner stove  and that 2 employees had called in sick. I mentioned that I didn't think it was right to serve some people at a table and not others. ""This is the way we do it, we're not going to change it, and Howard Seftel thought it was all right"", was the emphatic reply. More waiting. At 1:50 a different staff member came over and said it would be a few more minutes. To our disconcerted rumblings he said - and you're not going to believe this - ""The fish has to be defrosted slowly because of the parasites....""  At this point, I'll confess, I started to laugh loudly and somewhat
hysterically. It may have been rude, but I couldn't help myself. 

     We were out of time, so Leon decided he'd take the fish to go. Ken went up to the counter and gave one of my Valley Vittles cards to the ""parasite"" staff member, saying that the food was great but the service terrible. At which point the staff member had a melt-down, yelled at Ken to get out of his restaurant, then went slamming through the kitchen kicking something on the way out. 

     This was truly one of the oddest dining experiences I've ever had. Very Alice in Wonderland. But if you go equipped with the five items mentioned above, you'll have some excellent food.",0
"Every sports town should have a bar like this (just outside the arena). It's the first stop for conventioneers wandering into town (for a drink, post show). This ain't the place if you're looking for a quiet spot.. However, if you're looking for a lively and well furnished sports-bar, with attractive waitstaff, this place is great. The back room has huge leather booths. The outdoor seating is nice too--it can get a little wild after the events let loose.",1
"Simply stated..............a GREASY burger from start to finish..

NOT 4 me....This place I will avoid while I continue on to a real good burger joint.!!",0
"The service here was awful, we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table. Finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks. Another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying ""have you guys decided yet on what you want?"", uhh yeah!
Overall, service was poor and food was just okay. Won't be going back.",0
"I frequent this location before work quite a bit since I start work right around the normal dinner time. Always clean, friendly, and good food. They have real silverware and ""real"" plastic plates! Lol.",1
"great service, great food, and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant.

you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable. local breeze made it tolerable and i don't think my overly-sweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience. they had fans, a swamp cooler, and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture.

we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for. the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees. their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing. ok selection of beers, certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite, kiltlifter, to go with my coca-cola ham sandwich. my girlfirned (Rachel O.) went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish. it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it. the coca cola ham was HUGE and both of us only managed to eat half of it. leftovers are always good.

service was spot on, and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before. get over it, it's no longer pallete, move on, and enjoy the local breeze.",1
"Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylor's, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.  

Taylor's is open 6-4ish (I couldn't really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day they're actually open- which is always good with me.  

I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I don't know, but I'm in love.",1
"Nice looking place with average food and horrible service.  Everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing.  We literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us.  He wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there.  The food was luke-warm and nothing special.  I was only here once so I hate to be so down on the place, but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical.  Don't waste your money.",0
"The food was amazing and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was clean, quiet, serene.",1
"This particular Wal-Mart has gone a major renovation.  It is really clean store and well kept.  Unlike most Wal-Marts, they have put a Subway inside instead of a McDonalds.  This is now  Super Wal-Mart, so it has even groceries.  The interior of this store looks much like a Target, but has the Wal-Mart prices.  You can practically find everything here except alcohol.  It is right next to the 101 Freeway off Chaparral Exit, so its easy to find.  Most Wal-Marts are notorious for long waits, but there is self-checkout as well, which speeds up the process.",1
"Food and atmosphere, it's excellent for me. We ordered the chicken satay with peanut sauce, my husband is generally picky and only praises the American comfort foods but this time , he liked it a lot. We ordered red chicken curry and two thumbs up! I cant wait to dine in at that place again. Winner!",1
"in town for a conference and craving 'real food'/a substantial breakfast to start the day - breakfast club, walking distance to our hotel, completely delivered.  our server was super friendly, though we were sleepy and indecisive; she recommended the french toast side we ordered to be made ala bananas foster - YUM.  more like dessert but nothing wrong with dessert for breakfast...  otherwise we had fairly standard egg dishes but they were yummy, fresh, served quickly, and exactly what we needed.

the *only* complaint i have is wayfinding - perhaps, since they were setting up for an event downstairs, it was moved - but there were ZERO signs on ground level, and while we could smell bacon/coffee/breakfast, we had to lap the block a few times and only found it because we figured we may as well try the escalator...  a few signs would go far.",1
"I love books and I love bargains. Put the two together, and you have a place called Bookmans, or as I like to call it, my book heaven. I recently purchased four books for about $30 -- that's the price of one, new hardbound book -- and was thrilled by all the great bargains I found during my casual stroll through the many, many isles of books, cds and dvds.

What I love about the whole used bookstore concept is being able to give a new life to a book someone didn't want anymore.  I especially get a kick out of finding old books with inscriptions inside. One I found says:

       ""Pam, This is my number 1 all time favorite book. I hope you have
        a relaxing holiday with your family and look forward to adventures
        in the new year!""

I felt bad for the inscriber, since the book obviously did not become Pam's favorite, so I bought it in hopes that the inscription would ring true for me.

I'm glad a bookstore like Bookmans is around and that they are able to compete with the big chains.  It is a great place to find great deals, and I'm hooked!",1
One of my favorite places to take my 3 and 4 year old. Only drawback is it gets really crowded- especially with the school groups so we call early to see how many school groups there are and then we decide if its worth it or not. They sometimes host 500 kids at this museum and thats just not fun. Other than that this place is amazing.,1
"Beautiful hotel, great pool, nice restaurants, fantastic service, fabulous place to stay.",1
Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.,1
"This club has great bands.  I saw 68 Guns and Metal Elvis here.  Also at the Metal Elvis show was a Van Halen tribute band called VH Too.  The music is top notch and it is usually not too crowded so you can go right up to the stage.  However, there are only a few tables, which is annoying if you need a place to put your drink or coat or something.  I also wish the ceilings were a bit higher.  Would be better if they could combine an indoor/outdoor area with the stage.  Overall the building seems cramped, small and old.  The prices are reasonable though.  The location is kind of strange however.  We took a cab there but when we wanted to leave we couldn't get one to come pick us up despite the staff saying they called one.  Finally we walked to a gas station and called from there.  This reminds me too much of Club Red.  Great bands, crappy club.  I hope that someone opens a brand new club for bands of this caliber.  Or else I will need to open one myself.",0
"We went on a Saturday night and the place was completely dead. There was only one other couple in the entire restaurant section. Very nice decor, but the food was mediocre at best. The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because the service was outstanding.",0
Cheap and delicious!  Can't beat that.,1
"The burger I had there was tasteless and had a weird texture. The fries were decent and their signature Rootbeer was delicious, but I've definitely had better elsewhere.

In all fairness, I did not try their frozen selection, so I will definitely come back to give them another try.",0
"I was super excited to find a place in Arizona that has vegetarian pho!

The service was just mediocre.  It met basic requirements without any friendliness.

Very cost effective= CHEAP.",1
"I guess it's not really the most accessible place, but Frank & Albert's is located in the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa and serves as one of their restaurants to their guests.  Since the other breakfast place they had was only a cafe that served baked goods, I decided to come here to have a proper breakfast.

When I asked what they recommended they immediately said ""the Biltmore Benedict"".  I was easily sold so I ordered one, and a coffee.

Cool thing about the coffee is they just bring you a carafe to serve yourself coffee as you please.  Not sure if this was because the waitress was lazy, but I thought it was nice.

The eggs benedict themselves were not the best.  On one hand the ham that they used was overcooked (ie. jerky).  On the other hand the english muffin was over toasted and too crispy, which kinda ruined the overall consistency.

It is a nice patio that they have to sit on, so I will give them that.  They apparently have a bird problem where birds kinda come and scavenge for food.  I didn't really mind it.",0
"Had a fantastic massage with Liz.  She knew all the muscle structure and pressure points.  Though not the fanciest of places, it's perfect if you just need to get a massage.  If you want to be pampered and get the spa feel, this may not be your place.  For me, my back hurt from sleeping crooked and I left feeling much better.",1
"My brother from San Francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area. I decided I'd let him choose where we'd go out even though I'd never ever heard of this place before. It was definitely in a not-so-glamorous area, tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center (sorry shopping center). When we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and set-up. It's definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time. 

We sat at the bar/long table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience. We started off with sake, and it was pretty darn smooth. We ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs, yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll. They were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that weren't on the menu. The chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good!

My brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu, especially for happy hour.",1
"Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.

Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.

My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.

This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said ""sorry""  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.

Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says ""This is your order, this is what you have"" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says ""ssssshhhhhh"" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?  

Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am.

What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that.",0
"I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15+ years, mostly for routine maintenance, but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you. We have never had any problems with their service or repairs, and they have always been reasonably priced, fair and honest with us.

They also refill propane tanks.

Note -- this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers. Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 :-)",1
"Was here awhile back and Sharon H's review will sum it for atmosphere but i will try and cover my feelings on the taste.

The bruchetta is great.

Yeah really that simple. I haven't tried much but bruchetta here but haven't really been disappointed either. Even the ones that ""haven't been a fan of"" of the ones i tried when i have mixed and matched when getting to select I still would order over bruchetta at most places as they are still very good. Did try a pizza once and wasn't amazed but nothing stood out (it's been awhile since that). The bruchetta however comes to mind every time i hear the word.

Oh and the service is very friendly and attentive. One night I was in and they had just finished a major catering event and it had said on the front door that the kitchen was going to be slow until about the time we arrived. Yet when we ordered and it took a bit to get the food (barely a delay in my book and if I hadn't been apologized to by the waiter probably wouldn't have know it was longer than normal) we got a nice little discount.",1
"Place is always friend, and I LOVE THE PIZZA.     It's by far my favorite pizza place.   Sign up on their VIP newsletter or eclub and you get a free pizza on your birthday, get it for free and try it.     Sounds good to me.",1
"Holy AMAZING.  I went here this past Saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food.  We had a spread which included Mac & Cheese, Sliders, Chopped Salad, some bread and french fries.  I'm still thinking about those sliders and the french fries.  I can't WAIT to go back and order from the full menu. 

As is par for the Sam Fox course; the decor is over the top.  I need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house!",1

"My husband and I LOVE El Metate... we joke about putting a line item in our budget for this place we eat there so much. Their food is delicious, they are family owned and operated - always friendly. 
Their hot sauce is to die for, both green and red. It's possible I like El Metate better than Amados!",1
"We recently had a pleasure trip to AZ and I booked at the Fairmont Princess and I must say I made an AWESOME choice! 
- Room was I guess a standard King but it was so large and spacious with a couch and seating area as well as a very comfortably appointed bath and patio. The decor looked fresh and new as well. Very contemporary. Lovely. We were in building C and overlooked the rose/aroma garden which was quite quiet and pretty. Might have been a little better to overlook the lagoon with the firey fountain but we were pleased none the less.
- Pools were the best. We swam in the main south pool, the east pool and used the slides the kids area as well. Did a lot of night swimming as it was hot and gotta tell you...night swimming rules! We rarely get to do where I live.
- Restaurants and bars were very good...if a bit pricey...as well. We had dinner at Bourdon Steak by Michael Mina which was very tasty and nice ambiance. Ate at Hacienda Restaurant and also at the bar at an outside table. Kinda liked eating at the bar better. Yum of the drinks. 
- Great trip....great place...we will be back!",1
"After a night of debauchery with friends, my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho. I've been a regular at Cyclo's for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new. I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen! I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patrons...probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes. The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed. The decor had a modern Asian feel: minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing - perfect for a Sunday afternoon.

We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien- House PHO'nomenal (House special combination of *sliced eye round steak, well-done brisket, well-done flank, soft tendon, tripe, and beef meatball) and the Pho Tai (Sliced eye round steak) and Goi Cuon- Spring Rolls. As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared. Both were delicious, filling, and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering. I've experienced a few places that use a little too much anise, so much that you can't get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation. The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho. 

I give Pho Ao Sen 5 stars! Best Pho I've had in the valley, beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl! :)",1
"We used the taco cart for my 30th birthday this past weekend and we came away very impressed. Eduardo was the guy that came to our fiesta, and he was incredible. When he arrived, we experienced a haboob and he immediately stepped in and helped bring in our decorations and furniture. He waited about 30 minutes until serving because we were unsure if the haboob was going to attack again. My wife and I are both in the restaurant biz and so were many of the guests, we all came away impressed with the food quality. Next time we throw a party, we will use them again! Make sure to get the el pastor and carnitas. Great job Hector & Eduardo.",1
"This is one of my favorite theaters.

With that said, I suggest you prepare yourself for having to wade through an onslaught of pre-teen cliques if you plan on making your way to the ticket counter on a Friday or Saturday evening.

If you're like me, safety is a concern.  Not to worry here.  I've always seen an officer on premises during the main drop-the-kids-off / pick-the-kids-up window.

This location still has a new feeling to it, and it is clean and cool.  Nice cushy seats with cup holders, and I have yet to hear the soles of my shoes stick to the floor as I walk down an aisle.

My favorite seats are the ones with the railing in front.  A place to perch my feet.

-Swoop",1
"I love cupcakes. Its true. I really do. I have waited in an hour long line outside of Magnolia Bakery in NYC to experience the bakery that started the cupcake craze. That said, if there is a good cupcake to be had, I'm on my way to experience it. I must note- that I am not a fan of Sprinkles; as I think they are overly dry and waayy too hyped.

We just ordered two dozen different flavors from Mind Over Batter to celebrate our August birthdays (its a tradition we do once a month from baker's around town). Because of my love for all thinks coffee- I got the Carmel Mocchiato. Let me just say- i wished I took a picture. But I couldn't help but to dive in. Mocha Buttercream frosting-piled high, crushed coffee toffee and carmel drizzle. 

I also heard rave reviews from the office about the Birthday Cake and the Chocolate Red Velvet. The one I most want to try is the Lemon Drop (because I love lemon).

I'll be back in very soon to check out more flavors and cake pops.",1
"Every time I visit my parents, I pass this place and see a long line of cars. Curiosity (and a good set of luggage my parents found here) finally convinced me to stop by. 

Well, it's a flea market. WYSIWYG. There's the good (nice luggage, some nice jewelry, some good foodstuffs), the bad (the same ""authentic"" Southwestern stuff you find in any gift shop from San Antonio to San Diego), and the ugly (several ""I [heart] Columbus"" Beanie Babies). 

I'll come back if I'm looking for something in particular (chiefly luggage or salsa) or want to get a souvenir for a relative I don't like very much.",0
"This was supposed to be my trip to have the best pizza in America. So imagine my disappointment that they don't even serve it at lunch. What human who eats pizza thinks it should only be served at dinner?  Whaaat?  I have since been kindly corrected by another yelper that this restaurant isn't the pizzeria. My party was confused, since the server said they DO serve pizza...at dinner. The soprassata focaccia sandwich was fine, but overpriced by about $3. 

I don't live here to try it again, so the first impression is the only impression. I'll leave it to all you foodie hipsters to prop up the rating.",0
"I'm sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible:(  Chef Aaron please come by and monitor your staff.  We had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster.  It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.  The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful...and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the ""hood"".",0
"I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, ""Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?"" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didn't blame anyone, and didn't use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it. 

Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. I'm not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min- 

Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat!

After dinner, I ordered another margarita...

This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. 'Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, that's all I'm going to say. Thanks!

That's why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion.
I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.

I will surely be going back, and I won't have a bad time.",1
"My wife and I just got married at Blackstone, and I'm still amazed at how awesome they are to work with.  Elizabeth, Megan, and Alicia all worked tirelessly to make our wedding memorable.  The location couldn't have been better, I'm still getting compliments on how beautiful it was.  We read the glowing reviews prior to booking, and all I can say is that I agree with them 100%.",1
"If Star of India (SoI) is named after the historic ship that set sail from Great Britain to India then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare. 

Like many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. 

Experiences with the order could be as follows: 
Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. 
Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. 
Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. 
Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. 

Finally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost.",0
"This dry-rub barbecue was delicious. The ""sassy"" barbecue sauce was meh, but the sweet was good enough to make up for it.",1
"Tarbell's is top notch in all areas!  Food quality, service, ambience, amazing!  I recently took ten business associates there for a meeting, and I got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant!  

Definitely try the Spaghetti & Meatballs as well as the Mac N Cheese, and even the Pizzas are to die for.  And the burger too!  You really cant go wrong here.  Warning the deserts here are HUGE (yet amazing).  One desert is enough for 2-3 people!",1
"We've take our daughter to Dr. Ramirez at TLC since we were released from the hospital.  I've seen all but one of the four doctors, and have been extremely pleased with all of them.  They offer both a sick and well child waiting room.  Our daughter loves the themed rooms.  With small children, you will have the inevitable emergencies that require a doctors visit.  My child is two now, and we have never been unable to get an emergency/sick appointment.  Our phone calls have always been promptly returned on the same day.  Anything they told us they were doing, was done as promised.  I cannot recommend them highly enough!",1
"Wow, is this some fantastic food! It was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and I couldn't be more pleased. Not only was the staff friendly and attentive, the food was phenomenal. Presentation and taste were top notch. The Tai fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.

"I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come, and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should, then try Cibo!  

I took my man here for ""mystery date night"" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  

I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)",1
This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me,0
"I had every intention of giving this place a chance.  Mostly because it doesn't look like the kind of place that people RAVE about after a meal.  Sometimes making a snap judgment is completely justified!

We were intially given a server that was not at all confident in her ability to perform her job even at the most basic of levels.  When she was asked about the ""specials"", she shrugged her shoulders and told us she didn't know about the ingredients or sides that were available.  I was still hanging in there and giving this place my all.  Afterall... she could have been new, having a terrible day OR goodness knows what she was going through that day?  Then the baby started screaming in the booth next to us and every server in the place ran for the hills, leaving the issue unaddressed.  PEOPLE!... if you have a crying baby, FOR THE LOVE... take the poor little thing outside and deal with the problem, don't force unsuspecting strangers to listen to it.  We opted for a changed of scenery within the restaurant after five minutes of non-stop crying and were moved into the main area of the restaurant and reassigned to a new server.

She no sooner finished warming my coffee (I use this term loosely, as it was more like colored water) before I glanced into the grill area which open for the whole restaurant to see.  This was the nightmare... I saw a rather large female cook with a tissue paper plug in her nose.  Anyone who's ever had a bloody nose knows that this is one of the few things you can do to passify the DRIPPING BLOOD!!  You would think a bloody nose would qualify one for a break until the bleeding subsided, wouldn't you??

I don't think i'll be able to bring myself to visit this place again!!  In the mean time... might I suggest some food safety training??",0
"How very disappointing!  Nello's had a delightful menu with an array of salads, pizzas and sandwiches. Not Jac's. If the new restaurant wants to be a ""pub"", it should have a wider variety of selections. The menu was sad.

Due to dietary restrictions, I asked for a plain garden salad. Lettuce, tomatoes and onions. And it wasn't very fresh either. Sad.

Guess we'll be driving up north to Pima Crossing to visit Nello's.",0
"This was my go to Vietnamese restaurant for pho and rice plates not because it's my favorite but because of convenience. Pho Avina is closer to me but that place is terrible so I end up going to this place. It also helps that LeeLee Supermarket is one street over so I get a Viet fix and my Asian needs shopping in one trip. The pho and com tam is average. The service is fast and friendly enough. I do find it a big stingy that they don't bring out the bowl of broth/soup before you get your rice plate unless you ask for it. 

All in all this place is fine if you just want an average meal; nothing to rave about here. If I felt like driving farther, I'd definitely hit up Pho Van in Chandler for pho or Com Tam Thuan Kieu in Mesa for com tam.",0
"Clean, comfortable, smoke-free, fast service, nice staff.

Also, their complimentary breakfast had a nice variety of food items. There is juice and coffee; bagels, yogurts, waffles and cereals.

The hotel was a lot nicer than I expected, and I would definitely stay here again.",1
"OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  

Please, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  

You know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.

  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops.",0
"I'm a loyal patron of Steve's Krazy Subs, so i don't want to get involved in a family rivalry.  However, sandwiches are my business and they deserve a fair critique regardless.  At first approach, Neds is much more of a professional looking sub shop.  Nice large dining area, clean, fancy tables (*more on those in a minute) I was glad to see that Neds had the same lunch special...8 in poorboy, chips and drink.$1 more at Neds, but you get bigger chips.  Tasted exactly the same, so tough to compare.  My only complaint is the booths.  Probably great if you are 6'5, but for common folk, pretty uncomfy.",1
"So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.  
I read the reviews here and decided to try DV.
You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place!
There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.  
It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations.
I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.
She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.
She was quick but *really* methodical.  
I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX!
She even called me by name throughout the conversation.
$25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all",1
We have had nothing but good luck at this franchise so far. We've been here probably a dozen times. It's always clean and the food is fresh and the way it ought to be. Yum!,1
"I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe), but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!

When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.

For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy.",0
"Perfect location for breakfast before SF Giants spring training game. Also, Perfect location for drinks and snacks after the game. Enjoyed 3 meals in two days and will recommend to all my friends.",1
The Phoenix Hooters is directly opposite the Sheraton Downtown hotel where I was staying. Was really hungry and didn't want to eat at the hotel so decided to give hooters a try. Hooters girls are always a nice touch. I really liked this location since there was a lot of outside seating. The food is what you expect from Hooters. I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries. It was good but then I was very hungry. Food quality was good and arrived quickly. Can't ask for anything more!! Hooters girl was also cute!! I would come back with a crowed of guy for a drink and burger. Prices are very reasonable.,0
"Pauli from ATL checking in here.... just for a bit of nostalgia...

I used to live in Phoenix a few years back, and of all the places I miss eating at, this is #1 on my list.  I remember how I first heard of the place.... I was over at a friend's house in Scottsdale having a few beers after work, and remember asking him what his favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix was.  My friend, who had more than just a few beers in him, stared at me all glassy-eyed, got right in my face and said... ""Cheeeeno Banddddeeedo!!""  As I backed up a bit, thinking my friend had too much to drink (he had, for sure), I wondered... hmmm...the Chinese Bandit?  What the hell is that place about?!?  Or is he just f***ing with me?  So, I asked him what kind of food they serve there... And, as he did his best to focus on me, when his eyes hit mine, there was this long pause.... and he had this expression on his face that I can't forget... I wasn't sure if he was having trouble putting it into words or if he was sh***ing in his pants.   And then he put his hands together, like a nutjob working a Rubik's cube.... and said, ""They... dooo... things... like.... egg-foooo youngggg burrritos and jaaaade red chicken tacossssss....""..... as he gave me another crazy-ass look (the kind that tells you it's time to say goodnight and get outta there - which I did)....

So, a few days later, I remembered his drunken explanation of Chino Bandido and thought I would go check the place out.... And from that point on, I was hooked.   Egg foo young burritos indeed!   And jerk fried rice!   And those refried black beans with fire-in-the-bungholio sauce mixed in.... Yep, those will burn you twice... All served in a giant disposable aluminum baking dish... And you got that combo, along with a soda and tip for about $10!!!   WOW!!  

At that time, I had never seen anything like it before, and I still miss eating there more than any of my favorite old haunts in Phoenix.... I wish somebody would franchise one out to Atlanta - I would be the first customer in the door on opening day, guaranteed....",1
"I've been frequenting the Dollar store for the past three weeks while shopping for a work project. I have bought just about every pair of safety scissors in Phoenix, playdough, and other small manipulatives for elementary reading and math kids.

Anytime I need cleaning supplies for home I head straight to this Dollar Tree Store. They have the BEST carpet cleaner called LA's Totally Awesome Carpet Spot and Stain Remover. It really works!!

The Dollar Tree is a great place to stock up on cheap party decorations.

Shopping at the Dollar Tree is kinda like buying a Saturn. You know the price before you walk in and how much you're going to spend before you check out. I love that!",1
"Aiello's is my favorite Italian spot in the Valley.  In fact, I day dream about the Mushroom Ravioli Special - you can taste the love in this dish.   Great ambiance and a wonderful experience.  The staff are always attentive and professional.  The Owner makes a stop or two to make sure you're having a good time and they even let chance decide who pays for dinner, you or the house!

Helpful hint:  Try no to get stuffed on the tasty bread and hot peppers served before the entree, you're going to want to finish it!",1
"This place is as good as I'd heard.  We came here for a day-late birthday dinner for my middle daughter/Father's Day dinner for her husband.  She and his six-year old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham, he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, and romano cheese.  Both were so delicious!  He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all, dipped in either of two great sauces, ranch or marinara.  The pizza's were about $13 each for the larges.  I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldn't resist taking a third piece at this place. 

The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything.

 I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here.  


On a side note, next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good!

"Pretty yummy! I just went here for lunch and thought the pricing was the best feature. $6.95 for all entrees, which includes a bowl of spicy chicken soup (not sure of name). I ordered the Panang with pork and loved it. It had great flavor and the serving size was appropriate for lunch. Don't let the restaurant's outside appearance scare you - the inside is not too bad. The servers were very nice and efficient. I'll be back, guaranteed, because they serve quickly and it works for my lunch hour.",1
"My parents and I went to here after leaving a previous restaurant for poor service. Big Buddha was the the complete opposite! They were attentive, the food was steaming hot and delicious. Definitely recommend for dine-in or event take out. The Singapore Noodles and Honey Walnut Chicken are definitely must tries.",1
"I was in phoenix on business and im allways looking for some good eats , I found this place with the help of yelp and food network app on my i phone . 
I originally planned on getting the waffle that everyone raved about , but ended up getting the Special Andouille sausage scramble ( spicy!) but very good . Hash Browns were good and i also liked the sour dough toast . 
When i go back im definatly gonna try the waffle 
Be ready to wait for a seat , it doesnt seem very big . 
Singles get seated faster because they have counter style seating",1
"Monkey Pants has some of the best burgers in AZ.  Great place for a long lazy lunch over some pitchers.  I think one month my friends and I went there like 20 times for lunch.  Never got sick of it.  It's a dive bar, but it's a cool dive bar.",1
"I have been here about 3 times, twice  for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch. The food is similar to Denny's, so nothing special here. Everything here feels dingy and dirty, there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet.

Hate long lines at the DMV?  Hate dealing with the DMV for any reason? Then you should check out Desert Title Service.  I had a complicated Title transfer and was dreading spending 4 hours at the DMV office the last day of the month but I knew I had to do it.  So today my daughter and I went over to DMV and waited an hour before deciding to call Desert Title Service.  Had I known I could go in to a place with no lines get a title release and a title transfer I would have checked them out sooner.  I called their office while sitting in the DMV and drove over.  In less then 15 minutes I had the title released and the title transferred.  Daughter had new plates and her title in less then 5.  If you need anything to do with your car I urge you to call them and/or visit their office.  You will be surprised at how fast and efficient their office is.  I will never visit the DMV unless I have to.,1
"Yummy!  We would go to Canter's in LA before I moved out here so this is a good comparable Pastrami Sandwich.  Very close to where we live which is great.  Prices are fine, a bit pricey, but oh well.  Overall, thumbs up!",1
"I have been craving some soul food for quite some time, so I kicked and screamed til someone finally took me to Lolo's. After memorizing the menu for weeks, I knew I wanted the Baby Ray. So we go in and I was overjoyed that they had a band playing some sweet grooves. I jammed out a lil while waiting for about 10 minutes. We were seated in a nice lil half booth/table combo and had a huge jar of koolaid and sweet tea delivered to us. Yum! I starting getting the biggest sugar rush halfway through the wait. When my food did arrive, I was presented with two waffles bigger than my face, 3 big pieces of chicken smothered in enough gravy and onions to fill a whole gravy boat. The chicken was spectacular, really good flavor and crisp(when not soaked in gravy, get it on the side?). Gravy was pretty good as well.  The waffles were alright, I can't say I am the biggest waffle fan, but the subtle cinnamon flavor was nice. I think the waffles could have been better in my opinion. I am kicking myself for not trying the grits and collared greens or the red velvet cake. I could not finish my second waffle though, so much food, couldn't even think. The service was probably a B-. The hostess was bubbly and sweet. Our server was busy and a little frazzled maybe. The server gave us the wrong change and seemed to not believe that she had. Waiting for the correction was longer than average for sure. Overall, though, I had a good time, perfect way to end my weekend.",1
"Picazzo's pizza is excellente! 

My wife and I were told about this little pizza place by a friend who swore by it, so we decided to try it out. We are sooooo glad that we did because the food quality & taste was amazing. My wife loves it so much that when I asked her where she wanted to go for her birthday...Dr. Weil's restaurant in Scottsdale or Picazzo's....guess which one she chose? Picazzo's FTW!

The prices are a little on the high side, but I am a firm believer in the saying, ""you get what you pay for"" & this pizza place was worth every penny.",1
"Beep Beep!  Who's got the keys to my jeep?  Vroooom! (Missy ""Misdemeanor "" Elliott)

Food Truck Friday happens, well, every Friday in downtown Phoenix.  Located off Pierce and Central the the food truck phenomenum has arrived in Phoenix.  Thank you Great Food Truck Race on Food Network!  Actually Food Truck Friday was started by the Phoenix Street Food Coalition.  If you didn't know, Phoenix lags behind in the food truck scene like Los Angeles, New York, Portland, etc.  Who knew huh?  Yeah, like you didn't know!

The area where this event happens is not very big.  Seating is a B-I-T-C (shut your mouth!) I'm not even going to bring up the Shaft!  However, come early enough and maybe you'll get lucky.  Some people to do the ""I'm saving these seats for a friend"", thing, which really really is annoying!  

Needless to say the scene is awesome!  Hot dogs, burgers, pizza, rice bowls, and cajun burritos!  I guarantee you'll come back for more and to explore the different flavors!  You definitely won't have all Friday to do so, but check out their daily weekly schedule - http://www.downtownphoenix.com/blog/tag/food-truck-fridays/ - Enjoy!",1
"I'm giving them a 5 star review for how they handled a poor experience we had.  My family came here for my brother's birthday a few weeks back, and two of our four dishes came out undercooked.  We brought it to the attention of our waitress, who brought the manager Adrienne over.  They both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill, which is what I would expect.  We were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didn't expect or ask for anything else.  However, they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake.

We took them up on the offer, and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around.  Our server was fantastic, Adrienne came by to make sure we were happy, and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal.  They really went above and beyond to make sure we left with a positive opinion of their restaurant.  Everybody makes a mistake once and awhile, but not everyone has such excellent customer service to correct it!  I will gladly return here as a result.",1
"Fabulous. 

Holy Kobe Beef Burger with Avocado, Bacon, and Cheese - It was the special of the day. I didnt care what it cost, I knew I had to have it. 

Come to think of it, that was the FIRST time in my life I've never ordered off the menu and actually went for the ""of the day"". I did it with my wine too!

I wasnt a HUGE fan of the parmesan fries, but I could be alone here. 

All in all, great place for some burger lovin! The milkshakes at the other table looked unreal!",1
"When shopping is an adventure and a destination, you must be heading to Tan Phat. This is a funky Asian market that has been there for me whenever I need water chestnuts (for wrapping in bacon, and they carry five different brands! Who knew so many companies were in the business of the water chestnut?) or kitchen supplies for Asian themed dinners. One of the first things that hits you upon entering in the smell of seafood. After acclimating to that, you'll find a huge selection of canned goods, dried seafood and mushrooms, a decent selection of fresh produce and an ample amount of ""novelty"" edibles (you know, those intriguingly package foodstuffs that you just can't find outside of Asian markets). 

The employees are usually polite. You may have to walk through every aisle to find what you need, but that's part of the adventure.",1
"I freakin love this place. My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused. Now that's just funny. My first time I was the same way, like what the hell do I do here. Now I'm a pro. Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing, Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook. Mmmm....good.",1
"Really great food and service, and it worked out just fine for my two kids, ages 7 and 10. (Meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one; the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels.) The food came very quickly. We had all small plates and pizza, not entrees: kale chips, fried chickpeas, peppers, mozzarella salad. Dessert was great. The mousse was first rate, and the parsnip creme brulée was delicious (though we couldn't taste any parsnip; it just tasted like excellent, flavorful creme brulée). One of the best meals we had in Arizona. And we also really liked the decor. Simple, elegant, and also fun/creative. Not sure why anyone would ding them for that. Also, the portion sizes were just fine. We all left full but not feeling gross. We're from MA, and were unaware of the chef's celebrity. I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing, or a reaction against some sort of hype? I'm outside that loop, but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension. Just thorough competence. Note: It's a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Under 2 miles.",1
"My daughter has been attending Gold Medal Swim School since February.  

The instructors are great!  They always take the time to say hello outside of class and they are very caring.  

The class ratio is fantastic - with a max of 3:1 in each beginner (Starfish) class.  

Currently the price is $72/month, which includes 1 class per week during the Spring and Summer and the ability to schedule unlimited classes per week from October-February.  The school also routinely sends emails for a free class when there is same day availability (usually with newer instructors).

The only reason I am leaving this at 4 stars is that my daughter has struggled with swim lessons in the indoor pool because some of the sky lights are not covered/filtered.  She is very sensitive to light and I am concerned she may not be able to progress with the way the skylights are currently.  Only time will tell!   

The management at Gold Medal is top notch, which is probably why they retain such happy employees!

Overall, I am very pleased with Gold Medal.  And, yes, the owners were Gold Medal Olympians!",1
"Food is good. Don't take kids though.
Kids pasta was $7 with no accompaniments.",0
"Who woulda thunkkkk Scottsdale, AZ would have such amazing soul food??! They surprised the hell outta me!

Coming from someone who regulars Roscoes chicken &waffles... believe me when I say LOLO's is BOMB!!! 

I got the 3chicken combo... w greens, mac&cheese &cornbread.
 
Cornbread.. hands down Roscoes!
Greens... Roscoes
Mac&cheese... LOLOs for suuuree!
Chicken... tied.. they're both really good!

the staff is super friendly!! can't wait to go back when i visit AZ. (=",1
Another place that's walking distance. Subway is one of those places where you can't go wrong....you got 5-dollar value meals or foot longs. The guys are really friendly and aren't stingy with the toppings. I'm not a big fan of the smell subway's have though. Eh anyways its just one of those places where im lazy and don't want to make a sandwich...plus it helps me keep my girlish figure like jared :),0
"At first I was disappointed with Padre's menu.  I usually get tacos, rice, and beans, and they only had soft tacos.  But then I ventured out and got this amazing beef burrito that came with rice and beans.  Really glad I tried it.

I was also pleased to see that they had Sol beer on the menu.  It is my favorite Mexican cerveza, and I usually can't find it in restaurants.",1
"I just went here for lunch.  I really have nothing to add to the other reviews on here because they pretty much all sum it up.  It gets crowded, the ordering process is a clusterfuk, they place looks sketchy and dirty, the staff is very friendly and helpful, yada yada.  The place isn't worth all the hype but definitely is worth a visit if you are in the mood for something unique.  Its not the healthiest or highest quality cuisine, but it is a pretty solid place and worth a shot.

* Jerk Chicken = very good
* Pollo Diablo = spicy and awesome and my stomach is going to hate me later
* Jade Red Chicken = excellent
* Pork Fried Rice = very good
* Red Salsa Stuff = excellent
* Refried Beans = standard
* Snickerdoodle Cookie = awesome",1
"Gracie's is a small thrift store with decent items.  The prices are a little less than you would pay at Goodwill.  You can get a pair of jeans for about $5.  If you need a belt, this would be a good place to go, only $2.  I didn't find anything to buy for myself, but we found a new pair of shorts for my son.  Only $2.50.   Just an FYI, it costs $0.75 to use your debit card.",0
"What a great little find especially for Phoenix!  I've been there on at least 4 occasions and have never been disappointed and just had to let everybody know about this little gem!  Recently  I took my mother and we had delicious Singapore Noodles and Malaysian Rice Noodles (which are kind of like Thai's Rad Na but better).  On another occasion my husband ordered Pork Belly Curry and really loved it.  I wasn't as adventurous and had delicious Chicken Kebab Burmese style.  Family owned, quiet, and very affordable.  You have to really look for this place since its in a shopping center(its on the north side of Shea between 70th & 71st St in Scottsdale). Great early bird dinners as well!",1
"A nice place to shop, but I wouldn't want to live there. 

I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macy's at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macy's store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price.

I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macy's. If you're in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out, then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store.",0
"This review is based on an event I attended here. I did not stay at the hotel as a guest or experience the bar. I was a guest at the Etiquette Dinner put on by ASU and affiliates. From the moment I entered the hotel, I felt welcomed. Each employee I passed greeted me with a smile and professionality. I thought the hotel interior was really cool also. When I was leaving the event, I thought how strange that locals never frequent hotels in their cities. I should try it!",1
"Ok it's a chain, so there's that...  But I'm like Bro'man and we luv us a good sammich!   And Capriotti's didn't disappoint there.

I went at an odd time and had the place to myself, it was quite clean and instead of just hanging out BS'ing the people were busy taking care of the place.

So the menu - short and sweet, that's how I like it.  Unlike a place like the friggin Cheezecake Crapory with it's 80,000 menu items, none of them done well, Capriotti's keeps it under control and turns out a tasty sammy.  

I had the turkey sub with spicy peppers, mmm mmmm.  I love the fresh roasted turkey like that, and the ""just like grandma made"" pickles.  Well not like either of my grandma's made, but someone's grandma...  The veggies passed the fresh & crispy test with flying colors and the sub roll was perfectly soft and chewy.

Ya it's slightly on the higher end fast sandwich price range, but its quality and pretty filling.  I made 2 meals out of the 9"", with the meal deal right around $10.  

I have a Groupon for the place and can't wait to take my good friend and get him hooked.  Next victim on my list:  the Bobbie!!",1
"Large Goodwill location (formally a PetSmart), but dark like a cave. This one is hit or miss... It is clean for a Goodwill (I've seen some pretty dirty ones). Just need to keep checking to find the treasures here.",1
"I came here on Saturday becuase I had to get my Jeep serviced, and I wanted to check this dealership out.  I made an appointment, and dropped my Jeep off in the sevice bay.

I was greeted when I walked into the dealer, and I had a decent experience here.  I DO have to say, that I didnt like waiting 3 hours, but that seems to be at most any dealership you go to for warranty work, so I cannot blame them for that.

What I DON'T like is going for service and tying to be ""sold"" on a new vehicle. Im in for service, not to buy or trade in my car.  Why do the salesman do that?  I know its thier job to sell, but not every single time.  Geez.  Annoying.",1
"Awesome bartender on the patio! Way great drink specials!! Don't come here to have conversations, folks. It's LOUD!! Great DJ spinning crazy dance music. Place gets way crowded so get there early and snag a spot to people watch!!",1
"I am furious.

In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.

Yesterday (the Friday before my ""correctly"" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.

Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.

My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like you're just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment.",0
"Joined @SMUNCHPhoenix at @GalloBlanco.

For my first breakfast at Gallo, I ordered Chilaquiles Verde, and my girlfriend had the Chorizo and Eggs.

We were both very happy with our choices!

The chilaquiles was delicious, with the crispy corn tortillas providing a nice contrast.

The chorizo and eggs were definitely in line with what I consider to be authentic.

I am definitely a fan of Gallo, and will return as often as time and money allow.",1
"I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be! 

Clean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library.",1
"There's no better way to find out about a new eatery than to receive a gift card to one you've never been to (or heard of, for that matter). This happened to me when I received a gift card to Paradise Bakery. Being new to Phoenix, of course I Yelp'd it to find one nearby. I located this on on the SWC of Bell Rd and 7th Street while up at Sam's Club. 

Paradise Bakery has sandwiches, salads, soups, sides, and of course -- the bakery items! At this location, you can eat in or take out. I like the Turkey Bacon Bravo or the Turkey Cranberry with a side of their excellent mac 'n' cheese and a drink. Getting this combo also scores you a free cookie! 

This location is in the shopping area with a huge Target and many other stores, so the parking is hit or miss, depending on the time of day/week. And PB's prices are just a bit steep for what they serve...good food, but still a bit pricey.",1
"I was looking for a place where I could get new tires and an oil change that was near home.  Luckily there is an Advanced Auto Service and Tire Center south of Old Town Scottsdale on Thomas Rd.  I initially went in for two new tires, but ended up getting four new tires since all tires were the original ones from when I bought the car.  Fortunately, I am getting a $80 rebate on the tires which is a good thing considering the cost of the Goodyear tires.

It took about 90 minutes to get the four new tires installed in addition to an oil change.  I worked with Jason and he provided excellent customer service from inspecting my tires to recommending the best tires.",1
"This place is strictly a dessert place.  While they serve food, I would skip the food and go right to the dessert.  At least that is what I do, being that I have only eaten dessert at this place.

I have been here 3 times, all of which have been very good.  My only complaint is that the sundae's are a little pricey and the decor is pretty dated.  But it is an authentic retro, ice cream parlor.

The sundaes are always made up to perfection.  They have many unique flavors and I have enjoyed each one.  

Next time you are in need for a sugar fix, give this place a try!",1
"I've been going to this Costco location since I was a tyke, when it used to be called Price Club, and my parents carted me around in their giant warehouse sized shopping carts (Those were the days, and those huge carts were the coolest to sit in!).  The employees here are nice and friendly for the most part, and there are employees I see when I'm here that I remember from when I was in junior high, a testament to the happiness of the staff here if they've been at this location for so long.",1
"Although a bit pricey (hence the 4 stars), the martinis are GREAT, as is the food (the cobb salad is the best I've ever had).  Good service, cool crowd... can't wait until I can go back, which sadly is not soon enough now that I live in San Diego.",1
Amazing place. I had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies. Delicious great service! Although the check was a little late the waiter brough amaretto on the rocks to apologize!,1
"Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever! 

but it was just perfect in ever way!!! 

They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food.... 
its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :) 

my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!! 

i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing) 

WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share.... 

My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine 

we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves.... 

all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place... 

i cannot wait to come back!",1
"I love this place!

We weren't sure what to expect since the restaurant is in an office building plaza.  Kinda weird, but the employees in the other businesses are lucky!

We went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome Yelp reviews.  Our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didn't rush us while we were checking out the menu options.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni & cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans.  He also ordered a side of ribs to sample.  The wait wasn't too bad -- it took about 10 or 15 minutes and it was ready to go.  They are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it (which is awesome, because the sauce tastes SO good!).   It's a nice, thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from.

We go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs.  We pack everything up and go back to get those.  The employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs.  We repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husband's order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich.  We decide to let it go and eat our food.

The pulled pork has great flavor.  The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce.  However, we weren't going that route, because the sauce is too damn good not to eat.  The baked beans and macaroni & cheese were not anything special, but they were good.  The ribs were our favorite part!  We absolutely loved them.  Very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious.

This place is pretty far from where we live, but we would definitely go out of our way (again) to eat here more.",1
"This is obviously the mecca of the Phoenician mountain hikes, and deservedly so. Camelback is the perfect mix of central location, unparalleled views and, most importantly, a grueling workout. I love hiking this mountain because of the mix of rock types. It starts out as red rock near the base up to the hella scary rails, then very suddenly changes to a granite look-alike (Anyone know if that's actually granite about halfway up? It sure looks like it.) The last leg is bascially boulders that you have to crawl over, but the view at the top is an unbeatable 360-degree view of the Valley. Though South Mountain has a more centralized view, on Camelback you really feel on top of the whole Valley.

My only complaints: First, the parking is a nightmare, especially on the weekends. Perhaps it's just due to its reputation (and the surplus of multimillion-dollar homes in the area), but it can be hard to find a spot. Plus, people like to jockey for position on those rails, especially coming down, so be careful you don't take a tumble.",1
"Rally burger is a pretty great alternative to McD's or BK, and its somewhat unfortunate that there aren't more locations in the Phoenix area. Their seasoned fries are awesome and even better with chili. What I was really impressed with, though, is their value burger selection and flavor. A simple rally burger is a buck and change and seems like some of the non-value burgers at other fast food. Good condiment to meat ratio, and flavorful. And no skimping here...you get all the condiments even on a value burger: lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion...all that. The other thing I really liked was they have a value buffalo chicken burger which was actually really tasty. All in all, yes its fast food, but its a different flare with unique options and arguably better quality in some areas.",1
"Everyone knows about Pei Wei right?! I really thought so until my boyfriend admitted that he had never been. Challenge accepted. 

Now, I've been a frequent Pei Wei customer ever since I discovered Asian food did not always have to send to you running to the restroom. (Yeah, thanks for nothing Bing Heng and Great Wall Buffet). This isn't the best Asian food ever, but it is quick, accessible, and always pretty tasty. 

I've tried everything on the menu, but my favorite options are the Crab Wontons and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. I ordered these plus the Spicy Korean for my n00b boyfriend to try, and everything went better than expected. 

In fact, he even commented that the place was ""classier"" than he expected. 

Just a side note: you can order and pay online, so you don't have to wait for the takeout line. You can also choose the specific time you would like to pick up your food.",1
"Eyebrows are a very touchy subject. I'm literally convinced that unless you make some serious cash, finding an excellent and meticulous aesthetician is like finding a needle in a haystack. Well, Yelpers, I've been searching in this haystack for three months too long, and each time I leave thinking, ""They really don't listen to what I requested and I wasted money."" So, I decided, no longer was I going to leave spending $20.00 (tip included) on mediocre brows. I went back to doing my own, and I am completely satisfied.  Plus, the music selection is terrible. A positive, it's neat that they text you a 24 hour reminder notice. However, you better be sure you show up, because they do charge fees for tardies and no-shows.",0
"On a Friday night restaurant was busy, but the service was top drawer. Food was very good and we will be back. Prices reasonable.",1
"I love a greasy burger joint so I wanted to try Smashburger.  I took my order to go.  The layout of the store is different than most burger place...a rather minimalist front counter.  The service was quick, and I received my food in a reasonble amount of time.  It was hot and fresh.  I ordered the 1/3 Smashburger with everything and Smashfries.  The burger was ok.  It was spiced in the same way that Hamburger Works or the Chuckhouse does their burgers.   The veggies on the burger were fresh.  The bun started to fall apart about the time I finished the burger.  overall...it was just ok.  It ain't no Lenny Burger.  I'd rather go to Fatburger then Smashburger.  The fries were crispy and flavored.  They were good.  When I first saw them I thought the portion was rather small, but when I took it out of the box in which they came, it appeared to be a normal portion.

I won't avoid the place if people want to go there...but I won't make a special trip.",0
"I came in  on an early Friday morning to buy a dozen and a half of donuts for my co- workers. The man behind the counter found it odd I order such an amountapparently, by the way he repeated my order. In my case 1 dozen would have been too little, 2 dozen too many and I didn't want to waste any. That alrady made me feel uncomfortable. Just fulfill whatever order you get, I am customer. It was my first time here, after many, many drive by's. He asked me what flavors and suggested to make a mix, I didn't have a preference, as I just liked an assortment. Again I was frowned upon. Just give me your bestselling flavors...what's the problem. Well, I guess it was once and never again. The donuts were fresh tasting, but the service was far beyond friendly. To bad, you could have earned a new customer.",0
"Have been to the Garage twice now and they are batting 1 for 2.   

Went there on a Saturday for lunch and the food and service was excellent.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potatoe fries which was original for pulled pork served on a pizza crust bun.  My girlfriend had the buffalo chicken salad which was really good, grilled chicken in buffalo sauce on top of baby greens.  Excellent beer selection.

Went there on a Friday for happy hour and got there a little before 6, there was a 30 min wait for a indoor table or immediate seating on the patio, so we decided to sit on the patio.  Hostess sat us and said a server will be by shortly, normal procedure.  About 10 minutes later no server had come by and the hostess returned and asked us if we ave been helped yet, we said no so the hostess said she will get someone.  Another 10 minutes and no server.  It wasn't busy on the patio about 5 tables occupied, all with food and drink.  We decided that they must not want our business, so we went next door to Sushi Eye.

Will try again, just won't sit on the patio.",0
"Absolutely fabulous espresso place! The owner and staff are gracious and friendly, but most importantly they get coffee! I didn't have to explain how to make an espresso macchiato -- they just made it perfectly! I'll be here every time I visit Chandler!",1
"I'm happy to report these cows gave their best for me to eat. Thank you dear moo cows thank you! These burgers are meaty goodness. Recently I went to a lunch with my bf, her sis and Ma on the fly for her b/day since her first choice failed to be open on a Sunday afternoon..... Not her fault their site said they would be open. Bastards shaking my fist in the air didn't update the site. 
D O U B L E Grrrrr! I suggested Zin since we were in the proximity. 
So this is my 3rd time at this place. While pricey the portions of everything are large in charge & good. The ingredients are fresh, the meat juicy and the fries are crispy as they should be in my opinion. Note to your mother! Do not waste the fat & gym time on the creme brulee shake. It's nothing more then a fancy name on a regular old vanilla shake. Having said that... I am a creme brulee fan so that may have been it's downfall. I was expecting greatness and fireworks etc. I got a really good vanilla shake though don't get me wrong but name it a vanilla shake. Don't market it as a creme brulee shake. How to improve it and bring a tear to my eye? Put a creme brulee hat on it. Gimmie the crunchy, sweet I'm looking for expect and demand. Just put something on it to give it with that brulee feel or name it a vanilla shake. The best way to explain my feelings would be to say it was like setting up a date with someone on-line and having them show up and it's clear they are photogenic but possibly altered a bit and not the hottie in the pics on their profile. It is some one with a great personality and decent looks for sure just not the hottie. Still had a good time but my expectations were something else totally. The banana cream pie shake is de-lish and the Zin burger a def go. If you want a healthy choice go for the Tuna also very good and served perfectly rare. Mmmmm mmmm good.",0
"Back from holiday and had some amazing soups that made me reflect back on my experience here.  I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  
When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.  I wish her the best in her endeavor.",0
Very dated but clean. Fine for a one night stop on road trip. Free coffee in morning & cookies at night. Bathroom tiny!,0
"I have been to St. Francis twice - once for brunch and once for dinner. The brunch deserves 5 stars, we had great service and great food. Their bread was AMAZING! We had great service for dinner, but the food wasn't up to what I was expecting. Things were a little bland and the sauces on all the dishes was a little heavy. However, overall I would definitely recommend them.",1
"Hands down, the best breakfast I've had in Tempe/Phoenix.   We arrived on a Sunday morning around 9am and had no wait for a table.  The service was friendly and attentive.  A few slip ups on forgetting things in the kitchen (e.g. bringing someone's toast), but our waitress was great.

Everyone in our party loved their food.  I had the Vatican skillet (which we still can't figure out why it's called the Vatican...?) and blueberry pancakes.  Others had the three musketeers omelette and the breakfast burrito.  All of the food was awesome.

And then there was the brandied blackberry bread pudding dessert.  Oh. My. God.  I don't even have the words to describe it.  At least not words that are appropriate for yelp.  It alone is worth a trip to this restaurant.

I'll be back.  Not soon enough.",1
Tried this place multiple times.  Many different items.  The only thing Worth remembering were the margaritas and the had pretty good service.,0
"Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background, but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred, and until this morning unknown, pairing of chicken and waffles--a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it's ability to induce a religious experience.",1
"I really try to like Old Town Scottsdale - and if you look past all the God-Awful tourist traps it is actually quite a nice place with a number of top notch dining options - but in the end you can only walk by so many mass-produced ""native"" jewelry shops with ""Bargains"" before it all starts blending together.  Parking is generally a travesty but can be found if you're willing to wait it out and the public art is a nice touch.  For my dollar - go, grab a spot, and kill some time at Cartel, grab some local foods at Bodega, and maybe consider a bite at one of the locally owned restaurants like FnB or Praying Monk, and skip any place with turquoise jewelry in the window while focusing on the galleries that don't quite seem to fit the 'theme.'",0
Lots of awesome stores! Expensive and normal price...it is an indoor mall.  Has Starbucks and a Tiffanys...my two favorites!,1
This spicy chicken soup is a must have when sick. Always makes me feel better when my hubby brings it home for me.,1
"Fantastic.  Absolutely fantastic.  I recommend OHSO for anyone looking to dine at a neighborhood bar and grill. 

I was really shocked when I dined at OHSO for a Sunday brunch.  I figured the variety of beers would be the focal point of the brewery; boy, was I wrong.  This place has some of the best dishes in Scottsdale supported by a huge selection of beer.  

Let me say this with more clarity: great food differentiates this place, not the huge variety of beers.  This is a great achievement considering many breweries focus on providing rare beers with mediocre food.  

The ""Burger + Cheese"" is simply awesome.  
A GREAT brunch dish is the ""Breakfast Burrito"" as well as the ""Breakfast Flatbread.""",1
"My boyfriend and I were in Arizona on vacation for a wedding. The food was better than the average deli and they give you a free cookie with your order too. It is a shame they don't have these in malls near me. Although I read on their website that they have one at the Galleria which would have been nice when I lived in Davis, CA for college. 

Shopping really works up an appetite and this satisfied it well. and light enough not to ruin a dinner as we had a wedding to attend later that evening.",0
"Oh Yogurtland.....why can't I resist your calling?

I had to run an errand and saw this location next to a Fedex Office...perfect!  I dropped in and ordered:

Double Cookies & Cream, Strawberry, and Cheesecake...topped with Peanuts, Captain Crunch, and Reese's Peanut Butter Cup for around $4.90.

"Garlic roasted potatoes *check*
Amazing hummus and baba ganoush *check*
Cute waitresses, some of which are babes *check*
Inexpensive menu with quality ingredients *check*

There are many Mediterranean restaurants around Tempe that vary in quality and service. Pita Jungle seems to break the mold. There's something for everyone on their menu, be it the Mediterranean Chicken Salad or the Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza (both are awesome). 

Pita Jungle is located off of Apache Blvd very close to the campus of Arizona State University. While this location is a favorite along the student body, a good mix of locals and students come here. The waitresses are very friendly and especially professional for a restaurant that serve so many college students. Like I mentioned above, many of the waitresses are super cute.

Here is a meal of champions that I personally recommend

1. Start off with the baba ganoush with chicken. This is not on the menu, but hummus with chicken is, so just as for this. You get a large portion of freshly made baba ganoush covered with chopped roasted chicken. This is DELICIOUS.

2. For your main course, order the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. This is chicken breast with grilled tomatoes and onions with garlic sauce in a crispy pita wrap (lavosh). This comes with a Greek Salad, but they'll be happy to sub the salad for the garlic roasted potatoes for no charge.

3. Finish your meal with the Baklava coupe. This comes with 3 types of ice cream (I remember it comes with pistachio ice cream!), and it comes with pieces of baklava. So delicious. Even if you feel full, once you see this, your stomach will magically make room.

Pita Jungle gets a solid 4 stars from me. For a Tempe restaurant, I would give it an easy 5 stars, but with all things considered equal around Phoenix, I'll give it a solid 4.",1
"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I literally have never had a plate here I didn't like, they also have a interesting and ever changing list of specials (I usually order off the specials menu).  This is definitely one of those places I could eat at every day.  All that and I don't even drink beer, my friends really like the beer here though.",1
"It's the best!  Downstairs, hanging at the bar, you can't beat it!  

The food is EXCELLENT!!!",1
"I would give it 5 but, I want to try it again to make sure.
Very tasty Mole. good drinks. Great atmosphere. Excellent service.",1
"This place has great food - some of the best ""bar"" food around. But you really go for the beer. It's a brewery, right? 

I haven't tried a beer I didn't like here. There should be one that fits your taste, even if you're not a big beer drinker. The prices are reasonable and even better during happy hour which has two convenient times during the day (regular and reverse). If you're unfamiliar with the beer choices try a sampler and then grab a pint of your favorite!",1
"Wow, that is some great BBQ.  Probably the best I have had in Arizona.  The pork was great as were the BBQ beans.  I will be there again and again!",1
"This is the go-to place for me and and a few of my co-workers.  Why? Because it's somewhat healthy (one of my co-workers is vegetarian and they have a lot of vegan offerings) and we all love the food here.  Not everything is perfect, but the meat is always very well cooked and lean, they sometimes use too much garlic (but I like garlic) but the portions are healthy sized, and you don't have regret later for eating badly.  

The gyros here are great btw.",1
"Meh..not particularly memorable.
I've eaten at this location and the one by ASU, though I like this location better. I would probably only eat here if I was walking by and I was starving. 
The cookies ROCK though, I like that you get one with your sandwich. And they have my favorite flavor of Jones Soda (Sugar-free Black Cherry) which kicked ass. 

Warning: The roast beef sandwich (Overture?) comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother.  I like the spice but it was almost unbearable. My nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall. 

Go to Opa Grill next door instead.",0
Great date place! I was worried that I wouldn't like what they picked for me because I don't like vegetables but the chef worked right around that. The cheese plate was very good but the bread that it came with was fantastic!! The short ribs were great. I loved all of my wine pairings as well.,1
"I have never had a bad meal from here. I can't say the service is quite up to par considering the menu, interior and pricing, but sometimes the food is all you need to be won over. This restaurant is within walking distance from my work and when I have gone for lunch, I have never had to wait. The host is professional and poised. Unfortunately, the hostesses are not as much. But again, you can quickly look past that. The menu has already changed at least a couple of times which makes the dining even more fulfilling because you can keep trying new things! The food is definitely not average or casual cafe style, yet you can find things on the menu such as homemade chips, baked macaroni and cheese and a buffalo sloppy joe. The bar is beautiful and they have live jazz on Saturday nights.Great for a business lunch, a romantic dinner or tasteful happy hour.",1
"A definite four stars, the focus on fresh food and a great breakfast has build a strong following at this destination location in Scottsdale Civic Center. now that i think about it how can i not give this place a 5 stars theirs way to much creativity and freshnewssness in the fruit, veg and the nectar of the gods, Coffee, all packed into one nice bright orange place.  

Old Town has a few breakfast spots but this is one you have to find.  can i say I hope to see this as a Scottsdale yelp ""hidden gem.""

As for my last meal I had the prosciutto melt and it went past expectations, the fresh basil really added the extra taste.  

Service was ok, a typical cafe style, the restaurant does not seek to be over pertinacious, the look is clean and the cafe is a really nice touch with options to order and go.   

So many Little restaurants like this keeps me looking for the next one.  Don't forget for later in the night AZ 88 is just down a few steps.  

Happy breakfast,
Kevin
PS there seems to be some kind of yelp trend, does a hand full of yelps make a difference in a restaurant, does that have a yelp definition when this happens.",1
"Fun place to get masks for all my robberies.

I joke. but really you can get good masks at Easley's.",1
"""MMMM. THIS IS. A TASTY BURGER."" - Jules. Pulp Fiction.

I like this place, my siblings like this place, and it's the best thing I've got to remembering better times back home in California. 

It's a quick fix for people who want good burgers at a decent price. It always hits the spot when I'm feeling like a fatty. :)

Even considered biking all the way here from my house when my car was dead and going through the drive through. (Coz the cool kids did it back then... In CA anyway haha. And employees didn't care.)
I agree that drive thru is an atrociously long wait during the afternoon (after school). 
Peeps who work here seem pretty chill since I always ALWAYS, ask them for the hats and throw dozens and dozens of ketchup packets in with my to-go orders. Biiiiiiiiiiig plus!",1
"These little sliders are tasty, delicious and pretty speedy.  You get two and you can get them with or without grilled onions.  There is a home made type thousand island dressing on them that adds so much to these wonderous burgers!   Fries are 5 star as well...also enjoy the people watching...Scottsdale at its finest!",1
"People used to rave about this place - I never got it...and I find it interesting that several other folks said the SAME thing in their reviews.  The parking lot would be full if you didn't get here before 7 PM, the service was always terrible and the crowd was overwhelmingly hipster morons.  Yeah, sure - that's better than the popped collar frat boy meat heads on Mill Ave but not who I want to spend my time with.

This place is for folks with too much to prove.

I'm pretty sure I only went once - maybe twice...I won't be back.",0
"First timers to this park on an early Sunday morning. Me, my bf, and our 2 old English bulldogs had a great experience. 

You can choose between the active or passive dog park. We choose active but also decided to keep our dogs on leash being our first time and all. 

We were immediately greeted by a woman and her 2 boxers, very friendly. We walked the perimeter of the park to get our dogs use to being around other dogs and talked to several people along the way. 

We did have a small incident when a dog snapped at our dog but no harm, no foul. 

Looking forward to bringing the dogs here again!",1
"Tried a little if everything.  The bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good.  The bars have a moist short bread crust, it is absolutely addictive.  The strawberry cupcake was perfection.  Cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show.  Thank heavens it is not closer to home :)",1
"HA HAHAHAHAHA! 
""Pit"" is right.... man, this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness.
now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one, but two dance club (411 and Level), Peach Pit Afterdark.... I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto.
opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.

the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing ""sexy"" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).

i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.

anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave.",0
"The service was very slow. People at several tables were waiting, far to long for, drinks checks food. The table had no bread plate , no salt and pepper. No napkins.  We had to ask for everything. The busser did not seem to understand how to set a table. We ordered the beet salad, it had no flavor and huge -hard as a rock  beets, no cheese. Tiny orange wedges.  No good. 
I ordered, for a main dish the Covina, white fish. It was so salty I had to send it back. The waitress then informed me that I ordered it wrong! Last time I checked you made sure your food tasted good and wasn't toxic with salt. She informed me that it was served blackened, blackened does not mean coated in disgusting salt. My hubby ordered capellini. The shrimp were undercooked and not fresh. There was very little tomato sauce. It was bland greasy and void of any redeeming qualities. Again , like the beet salad, the veggies were not prepared correctly ......
huge lumps of tomatoes, , mix yourself?  How do you serve pasta with no sauce ? Overall I would say the chef is not talented. No one bothers to prep properly, no one is tasting the plates as they are so bad it is impossible to believe the menu is being checked and corrected. In the meantime to go back for a glass of wine and an appetizer may happen as there is some potential , just a glimmer ....and , in a few months, if enough people review, and finally .....if the owner is smart enough to stop this unfortunate cascade . The patio is pleasant, I hope someone cares enough.",0
Heather is awesome. She did my initial set of lashes and I've already gone back for a fill. Her prices are great and she does beautiful work! The compliments are rolling in. Absolutely recommend!,1
"My first visit to Sweet Republic and when I was done my first thought was, ""why did I take so long to come here!?""

I sampled a few of their ice creams and let me tell you.  All delicious.  In particular the mint chip ice cream was delicious.  It tastes like fresh mint because get this... it is!

Service was quick and friendly.  We got in right before a rush and let me tell you, the staff were able to handle it like pros.

Each of their ice creams are homemade and you can just taste the love mixed into each one.  You can tell how proud they are of their creations.  I wont go into the kinds of ice cream they have but can tell you that whatever you choose, you will love.

Stop on down, took me 30 minutes to get there from Gilbert, and enjoy a cone or cup.  Do yourself a favor and don't delay for 3 years like I did!",1
"I really dig this place!  But I have to say, every 3rd or 4th visit to this restraunt is a miss.  Not sure why- but it is most of the time spot on.  I love the Pho- but the noodle dishes are what is off.  

Either way, the owners are super sweet and nice and it usually is never too busy.  Service is good, carry out is great as well.  Just be careful in the noodle dish category, becuase if your really hungry, (in my experience) it may miss the mark.  Order pho to be safe!",1
"Oh my gooooooooodness!  I love this store.  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.  The experience was amazing.  The varieties were intriguing, the prices were reasonable, and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also, the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.  

When we visited the store, we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.  I hope there will be many more to come.",1
"I walked here in the heat and was immediately greeted with an ice cold beer. For free! It was a delicious IPA and the staff couldn't have been friendlier. There were even snacks. I also had another sample of their Camelback ale. Both were heaping samples, almost a full cup. The tour was fun and informative. The co owner George even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop!! We didn't bring our bikes. So awesome.  Definitely recommend. Lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon.",1
"Sometimes you just gotta have a burger.  I was in the Scottsdale Rd/Grayhawk area and noticed this place where Nick's used to be.  I tasted their burger at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival's Burger Battle and thought it was really good.

The CB&CB burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch.  The burger and carmelized onions worked together really well.  The tater tots were delicious.

Overall it was a satisfying meal and I'll be back soon.",1
"I've always had consistent quality of food and service here.  

Standard menu....everything is a la carte.  I've been to this specific location about half a dozen times....

I recommend City Hall or Mastro's (N. Scottsdale), over Morton's.  But between Fleming's and here, it's a tossup.  I would eat at either....but I would probably choose Fleming's over Morton's.",1
"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!",0
"I have been coming to this bar for over 4-years now - and I will continue to do so...  Just be aware that this is no longer ""J Chew & Company"".

Originally, when it was called ""J Chew"" I fell in love with the place - it had a cool underground loungy charm. It was the best place to meet new and interesting folks. Now it is known as ""Old Town Tavern"" and has more of a generic sports pub theme that is dominated by TVs. The crowd is slightly older and the bartenders aren't as wild/fun... Not a great place to take a date any more.

On the upside: The place is much cleaner now, has live music almost every night, and Tuesday movie-night has some serious potential. Check it out for yourself.",1
"We went to Milagro Grill for the 2nd time and it was delicious again.  The ambiance and patio are very nice.  The service is fast and friendly.  And the food is fantastic.  This time we had the chips and guac and pb&j appetizer.  Wow, both are wonderful.  We also had the chicken and chorizo mac n cheese-fantastic and filling!  Last time we had tacos with pineapple which was also wonderful.  Can't believe the place isn't packed every night  We live in the area and will go back soon!  You should too.",1
"This is one of my favorite places to eat when I get back to town.  Their beans are the best I've had.  Their tacos are made of shredded beef and fried with the fillings inside.  This makes the best product.  All of you lucky enough to live in the state don't realize how lucky you are to have this treat!  I'm usually not an enchilada fan, but you have to try one here.

Some of the reviews comment on decor.  While it is true the place is a little shabby and the salsa comes in squeeze bottles, I would much rather have their cheap prices than fine china.  And that salsa, I really would be tempted to steal one of those bottles, but then I'd have to check it in my bag to go back home!",1
"As I revealed in a previous review, my family loves InnSuites. This location is nestled in the Squaw Peak Mountain Preserve, close to the prestigious Biltmore area, and offers easy access to downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and the Camelback corporate corridor. 

InnSuites offers comfotable, clean rooms for a very rasonable price. And as with all of the InnSuites locations, the Northern location includes amenities such as free social hour and free hot breakfast with eggs, potatoes, waffles, toast, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, milk & juices. There isn't really much within walking distance at this location, so either plan to hang around the pool a lot or you'll need to have a car.",1
LOVE Five Guys!,1
"More a comment than a review. Suffice it to say, I L-O-V-E this store! Much to my surprise and delight they are opening a second store at 75th and Cactus! Right in my own backyard , don't ya know. Woo hoo! Now all we need for the NW valley is Lee's sandwiches, and a solid dim sum joint to complete my favorite Asian trifecta!!",1
"Treated my sister-in-law to a message here on Super Bowl Sunday.  They have great hours & were very accommodating even though we only made our appts about 24 hours in advance.  When we booked, the receptionist (who was really helpful and nice) mentioned the groupon promotion ($40 for $100 worth of services) as well as SpaFinder gift cards.  We thought we could combine them, and we arrived at our appt to find that they weren't supposed to combine discounts.  But the receptionist made an exception and we were really appreciative!

The massage was nice, could have used a little more pressure.  Cute atmosphere and friendly/helpful staff.  I would come back, especially with SpaFinder/discounts.",1
"I shouldn't have judged this place so soon. They are local to my apartment, they do deliver for $2.90, but I've been back 3 times since my first review and I'm getting bummed out here.

A few weeks back my boyfriend and I wanted to get a little buzzed at home, so we decided on streets of new york to deliver us some grub. We went with pasta. My boyfriend got the spaghetti with meat balls, and I got the meat ravioli. Ah I really hate to say this, but I would have had a better time eating a can of Chef Boyardee. I don't know what is up with their ""beef/sausage"" but it always has a funny taste to it. Kind of like when you re-heat a hamburger in the microwave. That taste. I was less than impressed. The salad it came with was decent, and I'd go back just for the bread, but even with a buzz I wasn't enjoying my pasta. The boyfriend agreed it lacked flavor and was 'off'. 

Then yesterday we decided to have another one of these nights, and do the Pizza instead since our pizza was good the first round. I got chicken and pepperoni on mine, and he got sausage. They charge extra for chicken. Um.. I don't really understand why. The chicken is breaded chicken strips that they just cut up and threw on the pizza. I wasn't impressed AT all. The sausage on my boyfriends pizza tasted weird and sweet like.... I don't know what's up with this place!

So I say if you're going to go with one of their pizzas, definitely get a coupon and stick to the basics. I suggest the bacon, or pepperoni.",0
"If you are looking for a serious pool experience, look no further than this hotel. You stay at this hotel for the pool and maybe the surrounding restaurants like Rico's, but especially for the pool. This pool includes: a lazy river, super slide, pool volleyball, miniature golf (yes, mini golf), a western village, at least three pools and plenty of hours of family-fun in the sun. Oh and adult kids are more than welcome too! 

This hotel provides the ultimate poolside experience, so if that's what you are looking for, this is your spot. You won't find ""so Scottsdale"" peeps with their stilettos and muscles popping out of their Ed Hardy. You will find down-to-earth people and families wanting to have a good time without worrying about what they look like in a bathing suit. 

The Squaw Peak property itself is pretty awesome too. I really think you could stay here and have a weekend's worth of activities without leaving the property. Squaw Peak Mtn is just a hop away and perfect for a morning hike, I've already professed my love to the pool above, they have plenty of restaurants on property including Rico's American Grill which is delicious and Hole-in-the-Wall which is fun old-western fun. They have a gift shop full of fun memorable items, they have a creamery, a general store with breakfast and snack essentials and let's not forget about the multiple tennis courts! As I said, this is a resort. This is an old school AZ resort. It's not frilly but it's fun and I think I'd take fun or frilly when it includes a pool like this! 

PS - summer rates are incredible and start at only $89 a night. It's worth it for a staycation or if you're in town for the weekend.",1
"Awesome Donuts! 

The only thing is, I was expecting the light fluffy glazed that Krispy Kreme has. This is not the same. HOWEVER these donuts are homemade delicious and why not support small businesses?!?! 

So why the 4/5 star instead of 5/5? Well the majority of our group LOVED the donuts and swears by them. HOWEVER, one or two just thought they were alright and preferred a light airy donut a la Krispy Kreme (lameeee). So thats why I am trying to represent all opinions here in my reviews.

We were headed there when they were closing the dining room apparently (the drive thru is 24 hours though), but the nice lady allowed us to come inside, we had a rather large group with us. 

THE BUTTERMILK donut is amazing!! TOTALLY worth the late night trip!!!

These donuts taste fresh, delicious, and the customer service was so great when we were there that night. This place is the best donut place I have been to in AZ. No more KKreme or DDonuts (that place is not that good anyway). Just go to Bosa and you will never go to a chain donut shop again.",1
"I am not a big beer drinker, so I can't attest to the many different options they have in that area, but I can tell you about their martinis.

They have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me.  My friend really liked the chocolate something or other martini, I had a pear one that was delicious and another pal really enjoyed the pomegranate press.

The food is pretty good or I was buzzed.  Or both.  We had the cheese pizza and an onion ring tower (both half-off for happy hour).  Which, by the way, truly is a tower of onion rings.  And then the waitress brought out a free piece of cheesecake for my birthday.  It was a great time had by all. 

But the best thing about Yard House is the location.  It's right by Kona and Z Tejas and if you start right at 3pm, you can hit happy hour at each location and then take the free trolley to Giligin's. Yes, I did this on Friday and it was TONS of fun. Try it.",1
"Probably go to this location, or the one at Arrowhead, once a month.  Very much a fan and rarely disappointed with each visit.  They usually have coupons online and they take them from your smartphone!  The only gripe I have is that their bananas at breakfast are usually still a little too green to be tasty.  Although the donut muffins make up for it!  Recommended for all meals, but lunch and dinner are usually a little better.  Screw Flanders.",1
"I am a BIG fan of chicken and waffles and I will try it just about anywhere it is served.  I especially love it in the morning; when everyone else is ordering a light breakfast, expect me to go for the fried chicken.

Lo-Lo's was just alright for me.  

I liked the chicken, but I was not fond of the waffles.  They were a little too... thin?  Light?  I dunno how to describe it, but I like my chicken AND my waffles to have a little crunch.  And there was kind of an interesting taste to the waffles.  I can't put my finger on the flavor.

I liked the atmosphere okay, but I probably won't be back.

I know Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe is not for everyone, but honestly I prefer the feel there.  It feels less ""affected"" by its customers, I guess.  For some reason I am finding it hard to come up with the words here, but Lo Lo's feels like it is the more popular cousin of Mrs. White's... you know... the one with the Letter in Football.

Anyway, I am glad Lo-Lo's is thriving...  Maybe I will try the Scottsdale location sometime to see if they have a different spin on things.",0
"I dropped off a ton of things here when I was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience.

Their donation program is quick and easy (just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin) and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community.

Such great people at this location especially.",1
"Very excited to try this place out.  I tried the sampler of all 4 beers and really enjoyed them all; however, the watermelon ale was my favorite.  Great service, cool, relaxed atmosphere and delicious beer = a winner!",1
Service at this location is superb and worth the wait when they are busy. Price and selection are awesome too!,1
"We just completed our third tour with Taste It Tours and we've been impressed with all of them.  All 3 tours are distinct and are loaded with excellent restaurants.  I've spent quite a bit of time downtown, but it can be daunting and I haven't ventured much to explore and try new things.  The tours take you to the places you may not notice as you whiz by, give the history (yes Phoenix has history), and overall just slow you down to take in the sights, sounds, and of course, food!

Can't decide which tour to take?  Start with the Original, then the warehouse and finally the evening.  Really, they're all good!  

Tips: Have a light snack before starting the tour.  Yes you do get a lot of food, but keep in mind that the tours start at 2pm or 6pm.  You have introductions, overview, some history and then a short walk to the first restaurant.  If you're skipping lunch, you might be very hungry when you arrive as the first restaurant.  2) Wear comfortable shoes.  You will be walking about 2 miles.  Nothing strenuous or fast paced, but just be conformable (also wear comfortable clothing as you will get full).  3) Pace yourself!  Don't eat everything that is in front of you.  Each restaurant gives a fair amount of food, now multiply that by 3+ more restaurants that remain on the tour...You get the idea.  You will be full!  

Highly recommend for anyone: locals, out of town visitors, guests of locals, team building, etc.  Really, who doesn't like food!

Side Note: Taste it Tours was founded by a few Phoenix locals who love food and their city.  They have only been around about a year now and have been doing extremely well.  They base their business around supporting local businesses (local supporting local).  I'm excited to see how well they've done and wish them all the best (More tours are in the works and I will definitely be taking them!)",1
"Grab a cup, grab an outdoor chair, enjoy the show!",1
"The price and pho was awesome. The waiter was great with helping me figure out what to get. Tried #11, loved the beef tendon and tender meat but not a fan of the meatballs (there was a tiny bone in mine). I am a spoiled NYC bahn mi eater so the bahn mi wasn't my favorite (I thought the meat was too fatty) but the boyfriend liked the BBQ pork bahn mi. I also love the do it yourself take home containers, homemade hot sauce, and I even heard they will refill your broth. Bring an appetite, even with the normal size I was stuffed!",1
"My son and I were in town and went by Pizzeria Bianco and didn't want to wait 2 hours, so while on the way back to the hotel, my son used Yelp and found this little gem. The pizza was pretty good, and I had a pasta special that was quite good. The owner was very attentive.

The nearby table had ordered a large pizza, and they were served a slab that was 1' x 3' on a wooden plank. Very Impressive!

The only negative is that the guy cooking the pizzas should let them get a little browner (maybe even a little char) to make the taste more authentic.",0
"Went here for lunch on a weekday and thought it'd be busier. The slower setting allowed for more personal attention though. The chef even came out to talk to us and gave us free samples of some of the desserts. The food was good, but didn't blow me away. I think it's a nice option for a snazzier (it's a little pricey) lunch with friends.",0
"I went during the week with my two young children. We met a friend who also has a young child. Nice use of space. We didn't watch television, but it does have a few flat panel TVs that would be nice during football season on a weekend.  The space was child friendly - nice menu although they didn't offer crayons to kids, which they said they were in the process of incorporating.  

Menu was huge and offered lots of traditional breakfast combinations. I had the waffle with eggs and sausage. I ordered the pigs in a blanket for my children. It is prepared with sausage that was fantastic. The perfect amount of spice and wrapped in pancakes that were also really good. My waffle was wonderful.  Really light and fluffy but with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside.  My friend ordered the French Toast, which was coated in captain crunch cereal (this sounds odd, but it was incredibly good and the bacon served with it balanced out the sweetness) and served with her choice of bacon. She ordered the applewood smoked bacon. It was excellent. They have five different types of bacon, including one infused with jalapeno, which I will try next time. 

The service was a bit slow, but understandable given it was the first week of opening.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone for a nice neighborhood breakfast spot!",1
"Its a Wal-Mart, with a subway inside.",1
"What a brewpub should be.  The beers are great. The food, the Slingers (wow) & the service is all top rate.  Lisa, the server was very helpfull. I need say no more.",1
"Nah. I forked over $13 for a club sandwich, mac 'n' cheese, and a large Pepsi.  The mac 'n' cheese was good, and the sandwich was just okay.  I say take your $13 and go to Texaz Grill!!!  WAY better food, and for $13 you can get dessert too.",0
"Average Cajun food, nothing special.  I came here late on a Tuesday night.  Few people there.  It's a dive of a place in a strip mall.  A bluesman was playing nice quiet blues on an electric guitar...very nice.  Kinda scruffy place with all the basic Cajun staples.  Nothing fancy.  Decent brews.  I think the bar tender was waiting tables.  I probably won't be back, but I had heard it was great and wanted to try it.  I think I like more upscale digs and fancier/pricier fare.",0
"Okay, if you're looking for a genuine Chicago Vienna Beef Red Hot or a NY Sabrett street cart dog; then you might not  understand Hot Dog Stop. HDS does sever Sabrett's but this is more of a gourmet hot dog place. 

The portions are very generous to say the least and very tasty. The folks who run the place are from France and have put their own spin on things. So if you're fixed on what a hot dog should be, then go to Luke's, or Al's or even A & W; but if you want 'something completely different, to borrow a phrase, then by all means try HDS.   

Enjoy!",1
"Great coffee shop with tasty lunch and dinner options, very good coffee and cozy atmosphere.  A couple of critiques -  I found the lunch and dinner menu a bit overpriced for what I received. 

 I frequently stop in early in the mornings for coffee and a muffin (I live in the area).  The muffins are EXCELLENT, unique and tasty . . when they are available. 

It doesn't seem like the pastry chef begins early enough in the morning to have pastries ready to go around 6:30 or 7am.  Most other niche coffee shops I've been to in the Phoenix area have fresh baked goods ready to go early in the AM for early commuters like myself.",0
"Love this place.  Great selection of beers, cheap ($3 per beer) happy hour, relaxed atmosphere and walking distance to the Light Rail.  Some nights they have live music which isn't always to my taste but I like that they provide a venue for local artists and musicians on top of everything else.  On First Fridays it's packed (so good or bad depending on your feeling about crowds - I avoid it those nights) but on other nights ... it's just a very cool and comfortable place to hang out.  Sometimes parking is kind of hard to find.",1
"Where do I begin? I love Casey Moore's!

What a great ambiance! The outside patio is where it's at, with tons of seating and misters. Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while you're waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly.

When I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! they're well-fed and happy). 

It gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didn't know they could bring their pets.. so now you know!

The oysters are good, but if you're eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you. I had never tried oysters before going to Casey's but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses.

If you're feeling pretty ballsy, go pee on the Blarney Stone! Every time I go there I wish I was a man so I could do it.",1
"Loved my visit here. I was talked into the meatloaf for dinner. I have never ordered meatloaf at a restaurant, but tonight I did. The combination of meatloaf, and a bit of mashed potatoes and gravy on my fork......HEAVEN. I was sure to chew in every corner of my mouth....my taste buds were going crazy.......",1
"Fajitas is one of those places where you may go for an occasional, unmemorable lunch. Nothing is gross. Nothing is exceptional. Everything is just, well, there. I've tried different variations of the fajitas theme over several lunches (chicken, steak, veggie, etc.) and they were all ok. Not a big fan of their tortillas, though.

If you work anywhere near there, then I'd say go ahead. It's a safe bet for lunch. You won't puke or curse the world. But is it a joint where I'm saying, ""Dude, you GOTTA try this place out""? Nah. You've had better fajitas elsewhere...

3 Stars.",0
"Let's see great coffee....great muffins....good service....coffee drinks need some work though. D&D never lets me down when it comes to plain ole american coffee....but there attempts at making coffee drinks to compete with Starbucks and even Mcdonald's for that matter come up lame. I tried for example the frozen hot chocolate the other day....taste like plain ole chocolate milk with whip cream. The coolatta's and other frozen drinks are not bad but Starbucks is much better.

However with all that being said....no one makes a better cup of coffee.......... by fast food standards anyway..... than does D&D. The coupons I get every couple of weeks also rock because I can get that great coffee cake muffin they make for 99 cents. I also get get coupons for 1.00  off combos.....free doughnuts....and even 99 cent for large coffee's (although I never have that size...LOL). So if your looking for great coffee and maybe  a cheap breakfast to go along with it give D&D a try and remember to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",1
"What can I say...Maharaja Palace was my midday getaway while living out in Phoenix, and I miss it dearly.  I visit as often as I can (up to three times a year, traveling from Hawaii) and when I do, I am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides.  The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive, especially when ensuring I've got enough na'an to sop up my plate's delightful curries.  I can't wait to return.  This is THE SPOT for Indian Food in the PHX Metro Area, hands down!",1
"I'm probably at TMI too often. Everybody is so nice, though, and the beer is so good. I have to admit, I really don't eat anything here but the appetizers. And I rarely stray from drinking a pint (or two) of Humboldt Brown. So, yes, I am predictable and limited. Despite my limitations, however, I love this place. It's my ""Cheers."" I am its Norm.

What rocks:  Best happy hour around. Seriously. $2.50 for some of the best brews in town? Although the hemp-seed infused Humboldt is my go-to brew, I've tried the raspberry ale (refreshing without being cloying), and the yummy  ""Inebriator"" Stout (which, believe me, will knock your socks off).

Good vibes, hip decor, comfortable without being pretentious. How can I not return on a regular basis?",1
"I am not in love with this place nor do I despise it.

I am Mr. Middle-of-the Road with Stacy's.

Somethings he does very well, others are just so-so.

Here are the Do's and Don'ts-

DO-Order a sweet potato pie to go. That happens to rock the house!
Have the pulled pork sandwich. Solid sandwich.

DONT--Do not and I mean DO NOT order the chicken BBQ sandwich. I ordered this a couple months ago and I could have used the shredded chicken as toothpicks. They were hard and came served in a weird cone-like shape on the bun. Also, skip the sweet potato fries. They are dry and taste like dirt. Yep, I said it. Sorry Stacy. Back to the drawing board on those.

The sauce is everything at a BBQ joint and his is just OK. Actually, I have had better in a store-bought bottle from AJs.

If you are in the area, go for it. If you live out in Glendale, it's probably not worth the drive. I am not sure what Bon Appetite was thinking when they gave this one of the top 10 new BBQ joints of 2009.

The lady who works behind the counter is funny as hell and is a total sweetheart! 

BTW--CASH MONEY only!",0
"If I could give zero stars, I would. Just about the worst experience for my friend and I. We came in for a quick and easy dinner.  After being ignored at the door way repeatedly, we sat ourselves.  First, we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus, but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back. Our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving. I have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone. They're lazy, slow, and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there.  The happy hour prices are great, but there are other RA's so do yourself a favor and go to a different location.",0
Excellent food and service!,1
Amanda was very helpful when we looking at the ferrits.....   A great pet store.,1
Now open on Saturdays!!!! Yes!!!!!,1
"I can't speak to the selection, hours, owners, or resident cat. I can tell you that we noticed an 'honor system' as we walked by tonight with our Mojo. An honor system in this day and age?! Yes please! Friend and I both picked a $1 paperback, shoved our bills under the door, and walked away feeling like winners, a silent invisible transaction between fellow bibliophiles...absolutely lovely!",1
"I was given a $100 gift card to use at Willow Stream Spa last December... I've been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then.  Well, guess what? Today was that day!

With my fiance out of town for the weekend, I took advantage of some much deserved ""Gabi time"" as I like to call my downtime.  I called a few days ago to make an appointment and I asked if there were any specials going on.  Lucky for me, there were several!  The one that was most appealing to me was the ""book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it.""  I chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it... I was in heaven!

I'll back up a moment and just say that I've been to the Willow Stream Spa before... years ago.  Today was even more heavenly than I remembered.  I checked in around noon and didn't leave until after 6pm.  I could've stayed longer, but I had to come home to take Minnie out!

The Willow Stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine... I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial.  I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck, back, and shoulders... (I've been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation).  She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.  I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.  So much so that I bought a couple on my way out.  

After my services, I had lunch (a delicious salad with veggies and chicken) while I wrote some thank you notes and read my book... It was so peaceful.  It was like an escape from the world and I enjoyed every second of it!

So, bottom line - if you are thinking about getting a spa-lover like me a gift anytime soon, Willow Stream Spa giftcards are always welcome... what an experience!  I'm feeling energized, relaxed, and peaceful.",1
"i love trader joe's!!! 

i think they're selection of products are just GREAT!!! i can't get enough of it.

the place is clean and the people are friendly. it's right next to michaels which is also great. it's in a convenient place. it seems like the people there are nutty-crunchy which i love!!",1
"Went back to True Foods ( i have been doing this a lot since my first trip) with my mom for dinner last week. It was amazing as always however this time was different. I tried a new menu item, the Bison burger ( i highly reccomend this) it was so tastey and very light for a burger. OMG! I want to say that this time was different because we had THE BEST SERVICE EVER! Our server Marcus was amazing. He was very informative, helpful, polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some. LOVE THIS CAT. Just thought I would give credit where it is due. Too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives. I work in a restaurant and know it's important for employers to know who their ""stars"" are. MARCUS is your star. A bright, and shiney star. lol

Loves: Shitaki mushroom lettuce cups, Ahi sliders, Spaghetti Squash, Kale Salad, Raviolli, Green Tea, Coffe (black) and I always have to have the Banana chocolate Tart. Definitely .",1
"http://stevelerer.com

I traveled to Phoenix only a few days away from the LA marathon in March and was determined to start carbo loading early. My first stop was Matt's Big Breakfast, a place I had patroned back in 2010. That time I ordered the item that Guy tried on triple D and it was really good. He ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs. It was delicious, with a great pesto topping, I only wished I could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if I had asked.

The restaurant is small usually with a 10 minute wait even for one person. I didn't mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before I was able to sit at the bar. The decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming. The staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me. Placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon, crispy hashbrowns, and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs. Everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast. The eggs were right under medium which is where I like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside. Somewhat like a potato latke, just without all the onion. By far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon. Sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isn't and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked. Matt's got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much. Just where I like it. I could have eaten platefuls of this stuff, if only they were in LA at the end of the marathon.

The last thing in my order was the real reason I returned to Matt's. Each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options. Bread aside, the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side. The jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant. It is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside. It has so much flavor in such a simple concoction, I could eat a jar of it. Too bad they only give you about two ounces. I wonder if they bottle and sell it because I would buy.

All in all Matt's Big Breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown Phoenix. No wonder it always has a wait. The peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but, in the end, I would come here every time I visit Phoenix just for the strawberry jam. Check out Matt's Big Breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think.

Overall Review: 7/10",1
"So happy that DryBar opened a Central Phoenix location! Fun atmosphere, great customer service and high quality blowouts...pretty much an exact replica of the North Scottsdale location but at a much more convenient location for me.

Took my sister-in-law here for a birthday treat. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and they accommodated our request to sit next to each other as we enjoyed our blowouts and mimosas. Great idea and great brand. Will definitely be back again for a special occasion 'do.",1
"I am one of those people that talk crap about Gordon Biersch behind its back but I'm nice to its face. I go there and continue having expensive yet mediocre meals, but like I just said- I go there. My boyfriend asked me once ""why do it to yourself when you don't enjoy it? "" I don't know. Maybe I'm a masochistic eater. Actually, I'm just very agreeable and I work super closeby. AND if I didn't go there I would just walk over to Whole foods and spend a zillion dollars on a goulash-y takeout container that I don't even like after I pay for it. For me, lunch is more about getting out and doing something else for an hour a day. If someone wants to go to GB I will happily tag along and probably eat, even though I know I wont like it. At least there's not much harm in that, except to my wallett! PS- Lori is the nicest, sweetest server/bartender ever and chatting with her makes up for the crappy food!",0
"Went here because of the reviews on Yelp,  very good.   Had the green papaya salad, great light taste and a very large portion with a few shrimp on top.   Had two types of curries and both of them were very tasty. I need more of that green papaya salad so I'll go back and try a few different things.",1
"Ok, I'll say this up front, I don't like chains.  There are just far too many awesome restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale to go to a chain.

That being said, this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal.  Yes, it ""seems"" expensive but once you've eaten here you'll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth.

So much awesome unlimited red meat.

Don't let them trick you with the salad bar!  It's killer but don't fill up!  And don't be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN, the sign of meat greed. hahahahaha.

Lastly, try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie, out of this world.",1
"If this place only served chips and their salsa bar, I would still give it 5 stars!  As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all! 

The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving! 

I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.  But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice! 

I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!",1
"Just a quick review to get the ball rolling. Popped in here on opening night, and was pleasantly surprised. Hubby and I split the Mussaman, a hearty portion of curried veggies and short-ribs, and the Garlic Veggies with tofu. The Mussaman was by far the star, and given it's $16 entree price it needed to be. I see a lot of promise here, though I do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood. I should hope once they get their liquor license (expected sometime in January according to the waitress) that the food prices will come down. I'm not holding my breath on this one, however, since the moniker ""Modern Thai"" has become euphemism for ""Expensive Thai."" I look forward to trying SaBai again after they've had some time to coalesce.",0
"Fecking Great.    

Update:

Went for lunch:   This time I thought the corned beef taquitos even  better than last, curry chips tad saltier.  Still loving the appetizers and the cider.  This time had the  cottage pie,  it's  really nothing to write home about, specially if you are from the region and your parent's wouldn't appreciate you seeing other cottage pies;)    Spend the extra on the sheperds  it's really much better.   This was ok , really really nothing special and the heat could have been better.   Service  is good, but pedestrian , the last time I had no time pressure, this time I did.     We're sitting at 3.5 - 3.75 now with the round up till 4. Still  I'll return
 

Original Review:
 First thanks to Julie P for pointing out that this place exists. That it's within stumbling distance of the house ( think prolonged zombie stumble over an hour  versus a quick trip and recover)  is even better. 
Cider on tap is Strongbow and you get it in a real pint., Yay.  Sadly that's all they have and there's no bottled ones to try ,  Strongbow is  the Bud of UK ciders and while it's way better than no cider or what passes for beer here it's not that hard to stock more of a common drink for a themed bar. 

Onto the Food  (I'll get to it as a venue some other time)  
Appetizers.  Curry and chips was exactly what it should have been  and a generation of Irish and UK kids have  grown up with this for lunch  at the local chip shop.   
 
The  corned beef and cabbage taquitos  I think  are moving up to be our #1 appetizer that's not a hot wing. Taste of these  and the hot mustart / tomatillo salsa on the base compliment each other nicely. Not heavy on the fat and delightfully  crunchy.  For once an Irish restaurant trying to do something other than name US staples with cute regional names. 

Main: Salad   and the sheperd's pie. Let's not get into the salad it's a waste of time reviewing vegetables.  The pie is pretty good and none of the flavours overwhelm each other. Not sure the champ ( mashed potatos ) atop them live up to what lies below but it's more a personal texture issue than it spoiled the overall dish.  

Bread and Butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal DON'T just  eat it and run round the  block four times before getting back in the car. 

Oddity?    parsley flakes on all the plates to make it green , please just buy green speckled plates , it's classier:D  At the end got a coupon for 25% off the next bill which I will certainly take them up on. It's as good  for food as any of the valley's Irish bars ( better imho)  but have to get back on pub quiz night  to really know.

Were in too early to hear the band but you can look at the pa, the space and  know it's going to sound  bad ( place looks like standing wave city)  with anything electric and full drum set.     The jukebox played ""i'm too sexy "" by Right said fred  WTF that really  messed up the ambience.Country bars don't have NIN on the box after all.",1
"""Meh. I've experienced better"" pretty much sums up my experience here tonight.
 
I have a sneaking suspicion that this is the go-to sushi place for people who either
 A) don't know anything about good sushi or
 B) have no taste buds and money burning a hole in their pocket

I didn't really know what to expect from this place before we arrived. I'd never heard of it before and the only reason we agreed to go was because it was close to my boyfriends house and our friend said it was pretty reasonable in price and quality of food.
My boyfriend and I arrived before our friends and we walked to in an almost completely deserted restaurant. There was some really bad techno remixes of popular songs playing in the background and an episode of Dr. Phil on the television. I sat down in one of their ridiculously tall bar chairs while my boyfriend went to grab us a menu we could look over while waiting for our friends to arrive. 
Most. Uncomfortable. Chairs. Ever! 
I couldn't have been sitting in it longer than a couple of mins before I had to get up out of it. The seat had an aluminum bar or something all the way around it that dug into my leg after sitting down. It's hard to describe how or why they were so uncomfortable, but if you've been here before you know what I mean. They clearly chose these chairs based on aesthetics alone. 
Anyway, our friends arrived and we all ordered our food. I decided on getting the ultimate salmon roll and I believe it was called the sun roll. I could be wrong on the name of that second one but it was something close to that. My boyfriend got a couple rolls and we decided to share a plate of tuna sashimi. For the 2 rolls I ordered and the plate of sashimi it was almost $40. My boyfriend got the sunshine roll and a las vegas roll. Those two rolls plus a drink was more than $20. So all together we spent more than $60. I love sushi. I would be more than happy to pay those prices for a plate of delicious fish. But what came out was not what I was expecting for the price we paid. 
My rolls were pretty, but they were almost inedible. I pretty much choked down the ultimate sushi roll. 2 or 3 pieces into eating it I debated wether or not it was worth finishing. The little tiny bit of smoked salmon that was inside was dry and I could barely taste the fresh salmon that was conservatively layered on top. I moved onto the whatever-sun roll and that was a little bit better but it was still lacking in flavor and texture. The sashimi was just awful. It didn't taste like fish, it almost didn't taste like anything, and the texture of it was really weird. It was almost chewy. My boyfriend and I have been known to just down entire plates of sashimi in less than a min or two, but after one piece he called it quits and it took me the entire rest of our time in the restaurant to finish the plate.
The staff was pretty nice, I mean they weren't going out of their way to be pleasant with us but they weren't rude either. 
All together I'd say this visit and the food was a total failure. I feel like this place's only saving grace is that it's clean and it's in a pretty convenient location. I would have liked to give this place another shot and try another couple of rolls before writing my review, but I was REALLY disappointed with the ""food"" (I am having a hard time even using that word because it was barely edible) I ordered. It wasn't the worst sushi in the world, but it wasn't anywhere near the best. And with the prices they're charging for these lack-luster rolls, I really don't see myself ever coming back here again.",0
"The food is good, but took a while to get to us.",0
"This place is our go to mexican place. I love the hot sauce and you can't go wrong with the Fundido sauce on the burritos. I personally enjoy the Chicken Fajito Chimi with Fundido sauce. It could possibly be the worst thing there to eat (and I love it). For the healthier days, I like the Pollo Salad. The chicken is always great here.",1
"Went for drinks and appetizers to help benefit Friends of Animal Control and Care and was not disappointed! I am not a big fan of alcoholic beverages but this place made them fantastically. Got the Dr. Funk while my companions got Zombie and Hurricane. All were very tasty especially the Dr. Funk. MmmMMm. 

The appetizers were well portioned, I got the sweet potato fries and the others got calamri and other fishy foods that I don't eat. No complaints from them so definitely a good sign. 

Service was great, even though we were doing the special we still received plenty of attention.

I will be back but this time to try some food!",1
"They close earlier than most large book retailers, 10pm ... Major bummer for those who like to hit up a bookstore late at night instead if the club! Lol. It seems I usually can't find what I want at this particular location. It's in my area or I'd probably pass on it altogether. This review is location specific. I do love bookstores in general...",0
"I love F&E. Been shopping at the 12th street location since it opened there doors. This store works best for me since I live a very busy lifestyle. The pre-packaged foods, fruits and veggies make life easier for me. For a small store they have a great variety of things to choose from. This is not a one stop shop to find everything, however they seem to always have the items that work best for me. They don't have as many Safeway or Fry's grocery deals, but they have discounted items regulary to choose from. There prices are slightly higher then Trader Joes for the amount of food.

The store is always neat and clean. There is tons of help incase you have guestions. You can bag your own or there is someone there to help you.",1
"Wonderful low priced food. Love the fries! Love the Buffalo Hot wings, Good spicy chicken sandwich, good chili cheese fries, Good variety of burgers.  Fast service. I fight the urge to stop in almost daily!",1
"I cant get enough of the Chicken Pesto with Feta sandwich here.  This place has a great sandwich for a reasonable price.

My only complaint is that they literally put mushrooms on EVERYTHING, but, if you are a mushroom fan, live it up. 

On another not, if you like fresh lemonade, you must get a glass of it here.  It goes great with any sandwich.

If you are in a Pasta mood, The chicken pesto pasta is excellent.",1
Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.,0
"In spite of being on the corner of 44th and Camelback it does a good job of insulating you from the traffic and taking you some place else, in this case our dear Communist neighbors to the South.  I like the sampler because it allows you to enjoy the finest island interpretations of pork, beef, and chicken.  Also, no meal is complete without going bananas for the ....well, tostones.

You gotta hand it to those Castro brothers.  They forcefully preside over a country that has a pretty great national cuisine.  Viva La Revolucion!",1
"Good food, decent price and a southwestern atmosphere. 

The food is decidedly better than the decor, but then again I've never been big on the southwestern look. Something about Antlers above my head while I'm trying to have a romantic night out with the lady just doesn't cut it for me. 

I (like most everyone else) recommend the big ass burger. You can't go wrong with their side of mac and cheese either and I recommend giving it a go regardless of how much you fill yourself with all their other delicious entrees.",1
"Hob Nob's Coffee House and Gourmet Deli is what has emerged from the dust and smoke that once was the Willo House (one ""w"", not two). Willo House was a Phoenix landmark beloved by many for its tremendous coffee, well-worn couches, and memories of Mary McCann's Poetry Slams--and loathed by others for its unmistakable smoke stench and vocally hung-over clientele.  So, like many CenPhos, I felt saddened  when I saw the ""closed"" sign hung on Willo's door earlier this year, and I've been watching for this coffee interloper to open its doors. I've been hopeful that we'd find a new funky midtown establishment to add to Phoenix's growing reputation for goodness. 

Feeling emboldened and optimistic after voting on November 4th, Baby Oli and I stopped into Hob Nob's for a morning caffeine treat.  
Let me begin by saying, holy moley, they got the smell of smoke out! I thought for sure that the odor of cloves and American Spirit would have permanently saturated the building's core.  In fact, there was not much at all inside to remind me of the Willo-that-was. They've knocked down walls to widen the space inside and painted in warm hues . The place now has what you might call ""a décor."" They said good-bye to funky and eclectic, and hello...hmm... Pottery Barn? 

I ordered an iced chai tea and a chocolate pastry. The chai was a chai, and the pastry was yummy, but not OMG-eat-here-this-instant yummy. The sandwich and salad menu looks awesome with sandwiches boasting of roast sirloin and ""the finest long line caught Albacore tuna center cut all white meat.""  They also have some pretty impressive looking hand-made chocolates.

I'm not going to lie, I do miss the old, lovingly run-down, Willo style. Hob Nob's felt a little too Scottsdale to me. I may be 100% wrong on this, but I don't think the owners of Hob Nob's are Phoenicians. The man who made my Chai had clearly never been to--or maybe even heard of--the original Willo, and wasn't interested in any jovial chit chat about the old locale, they spelled ""Willo House"" incorrectly on their take-away menu, and the place simply doesn't have that Phoenix feel. 

Regardless of the Scottsdale vibe, I will go back to try those sandwiches, or maybe to test out their springy couches and fire place while grading essays. I'd love to toss them one more star! Fingers crossed that they'll relax a bit and make the most of their great location!",0
Very slow service. Food is typical for BK.,0
"This is the old Rigatony's on Brown Rd- If you've never been, it has a Buca di Bepo-ish, before Buca was cool, sort of feel. They even serve their house chianti in a small water glass, instead of a wine goblet- adding to an authentic ""Joisey"" kind of feel.

This is traditional Italian-American fare, rich and flavorful- with big portions. The Chicken Piccata is crack-good. It's served in what I've come to learn is a Sicilian style, with a n awesome relish of tomatoes, capers, and green olives and a side of addictive Fett Alfredo. It never gets old.

Another great authentic dish is their Cecca- you can get it as a ""Pie"" (Pizza, that is) or over pasta. You just have try it. It's rich, refreshing, and explosively flavorful all at once.

The house salad is a variation on a traditional AntiPasto theme- and is a meal, and event, in and of its self.

The best thing about Mardeneley's is that EVERYTHING on the menu is good! It only gets Four stars because it could use a bit more snob appeal (and a better beer selection).",1
"07/09/2008  
Just went there last week for the first, and last, time.  I read the good reviews, so I was expecting much more.  I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.  I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.  Waste of time and money, I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck.
Oh, and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items.",0
"Good clean Chili's. Friendly staff, although that can be a bad thing... since I have to tip them extra because they refill my cup every 5 minutes. I have been going a little bit more than usual because of the ""2 for $20"" deal. Never had a bad experience here, just wish there was more on the 2-20 deal.",1
"I have have given it 3 stars, but my partner gave it 4, just keep that in mind.

I had wanted to check this place out from the first time I saw it, and when it came up on Groupon, it was fate. My partner is a sandwich lover, so it was perfect.

Firstly, they didn't have a lot of vegetarian options, which I found disppointing. I'm so sick of my only sandwich choices being either tomato/basil/mozz or lettuce/tomato/cheese...and that's pretty much what they had here. I went with the caprese option.

Warning; when they say fire roasted tomatoes, they mean WHOLE tomatoes on bread. Now, I'm ok with a few tomato slices here or there, but giant squishy tomatoes looming over a few spare pieces of (fresh) basil and (fresh) mozzerella? So not appetizing. I ate what I could, but was not impressed.

My partner, however, made her own sandwich with Turkey, cheese, and some veggies, and she loved it. I agree that the bread was good, and I enjoyed the popcorn chips (rather than potato). The staff was incredibly nice, although the service was a bit slow, and the seating options were a bit odd (and not very accessible for those with disabilities).

I wouldn't PLAN on coming here, but if we were in the neighborhood, I'd stop by.",0
"I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.

The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait.",1
Patio seating is lovely!,0
Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!,0
"Here's an update, because the buffet is out at lunchtime only now, with a regular menu at dinnertime:

This old place continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley, after 1 1/2 years & many visits.  It's friendly, inexpensive, peaceful & comfortable (even with lots of customers), & always satisfying.

This time I started with a delicious bowl of Menudo, a nice salad & several kinds of fresh fruit, tasty Cole Slaw, & then headed for the Mexican hot table.  Had some Spanish Rice, refried beans, a beef taquito, an excellent beef tamale (hand made, not some fast-food thing pretending to be a tamale!), & more, but saving room for some Chinese.

The tasty treats over at the Chinese hot table included TERRIFIC, big, meaty barbecued pork ribs, really good & crispy Sweet & Sour Pork (Hey Iain!), just-right fried rice, a steamed veggies dish in fish juice that included such treats as Chinese Snow Peas, all cooked just enough, & so on.

What a great lunch for $5.59!",1
"The naming of Asian themed restaurants is in need of a serious makeover. I think this is the next frontier for marketing gurus; a potential fortune could be made here. Most restaurants fall into the category of being painfully bland (""China Food""), vaguely insulting ethnic caricatures (""Mr. Yings' Happy China Meal"") or horrific puns (""Pho Sure""). Names like these don't inspire a lot of confidence in the quality of their food, even though that's not always the case (for example, ""China Food"" was actually pretty good).

So when I saw Thai Elephant, my mind immediately reversed the name which sounds suspiciously close to a parasitic disease (elephantiasis). Plus the fact that it's located in a strip mall is a bit of a red flag. But a growling stomach can overcome these biases and so I pulled into the lot......

......And was pleasantly surprised. This is actually pretty good Thai food. The inside is a little more ornate than you would have expected; there's the whitewashed walls that fits the strip mall theme, but the furniture is darker wood with slightly dimmed background lighting. A large screen TV was playing the Suns game in the back room and a small bar is present in the front part of the restaurant. There are a few tables as well as some seats with a mix of wooden booths and chairs.

Still wary, I ordered the hot tea, Thai sweet potatoes and chicken Pad Thai. All of these were above average: the Thai sweet potatoes were perfectly fried and mixed well with the slightly tangy sauce. I may have eaten more than ten times my body weight in Chicken Pad Thai over the years, and this was definitely above average. 

Although I was just here for dinner, I did see that they have a Happy Hour which runs from 5-7 pm. 

All in all, it's a pleasant place that belies its' strip mall exterior and is worth a visit for respectable Thai food.",1
"I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb! 

They have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good!

The burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is. 

The pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like. 

The staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!",0
"It's Baja Fresh, what can i say? It's clean, they're fast and it's a hell of a lot better than McDonald's. I usually call in my lunch order from work and it's almost always ready and waiting when I get there to pick it up.

I do have to say that their pico de gallo is great and I could probably live on just that for the rest of my life. I get extra cups of it and eat it all by itself.",0
"Tum Nak has so many good reviews and they deserve every one!  Far east Mesa can't be the best location for a place like this, but they seem to keep customers coming back (I definitely do anyway!).

The Yellow Curry (hot) is my favorite, but I've tried just about everything on their menu and I've never been disappointed.

The only negative is that the place is super small, so as the popularity gains, the more I find myself ordering to go :)",1
"Been going to Don and Charlie's for years now.  It's kind of a family tradition.  

A sports hangout, you may see some players and coaches during the off season as Scottsdale is a big place for spring training.  (This delighted my single girlfriends who took every opportunity to flirt the entire time I visited with them).

The bar is roomy and comfortable, with more than ample stools to accommodate my generous tush. Say hello to Shelley who is mi favorito bartender!  You are welcome to dine at the bar, but the dining room is much more comfortable, with a great deal of banquette seating-  which I adore.  I often have the veal chop, or a nice, big NY Strip.  Twice baked potatoes, creamed spinach......you know the routine in the ""good old boys' steakhouse.""  The best part is the house made chopped chicken livers which are simply to die for.

Valet service rounds out the numerous reasons to choose this place over others in the area.  I almost forgot the comprehensive wine list, including wines by the glass.

A must stop when you are in Scottsdale!",1
"This place is as good as it gets for shooting.   I became a full member today after also researching Shooter's World, Phoenix Rod & Gun, and Scottsdale Gun Club (where I will also become a member).   The cost is VERY reasonable at $85/year ($110 after adding the initial administrative fee).

The club is huge (140 acres).   There is a main range for members and the public.  Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.  

I'm really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend.",1
"This is the only Ben and Jerrys that has successfully withheld the recession in AZ.  This means that this is the only one left as well.  Its located in a beautiful plaza called El Pedregal.  They have live music on Sundays.  I found out this information from the friendly owner who told about the history of the store since I asked him if their location was really the only one open in all of AZ.

The location is very North Scottsdale.  I am not sure how it does for business, it is far from commercial areas.  On my drove over, I mostly noticed many well built homes.  

This is the only Ben and Jerrys left, and I strongly encourage those who enjoy this ice cream to go out and support their business.",1
"It pains me to write a negative review of PJ, but I just have to ... 
I was so excited for the new location to open because my husband and I go to the Indian School location any time we're down that way, and this is way closer to home. We were impressed by all the room up there! Not cramped like the other locations. Unfortunately, the food was not nearly as good! Both of our meals were not nearly as good as we've had before (at the other locations). 
Also, our service was terrible. We asked another server if ours was new, but nope: She'd bee there since it opened a couple months ago. She forgot jalapeno our hummus appetizer (to their credit, they brought it out after our meal and gave it to us for free, but it was bland and not that good). She charged me for a side of tahini, even though it was supposed to come with my veggie burger, and she never refilled our drinks. 
Overall, this was a very disappointing PJ experience. I'll try again one more time, but if it doesn't improve, I won't be going back to this North Valley location. :(",0
"My boyfriend and I had heard about the great food and romantic ambiance of Coup des Tartes so we decided to check it out.  Overall it was fine but we didn't think it lived up to the hype.

We knew ahead of time that it was BYOB but decided to forgo bringing alcohol because of the corking fees.  No biggie.  We enjoyed the lemonade and minted iced tea they served us.  We weren't hungry enough for appetizers, so we just ordered salads and entrees.  The salads came out quickly and did not disappoint.  I ordered the Springtime Salad ($10) and absolutely loved it.  Mixed greens with organic apples, red onions, dried cranberries, chevre, and candied walnuts with apple cider vinaigrette.  They put just the right amount of dressing on it so it was coated but not drenched.  My boyfriend ordered the Parmigiano ($9) and said it was very good as well.  It was your basic Caesar salad with homemade dressing.  Both salads were surprisingly large and could have satisfied us for dinner if we had ordered appetizers as well. 

Then came the entrees.  Well, sort of.  We sat there until we started to wonder if they were out hunting for our food.  Then we thought maybe we should have ordered an appetizer after all to close the gap a little between the salads and the entrees.  But really, why should we have to pay for something we weren't hungry for just so they can get their pacing right? 

Anyhow, the entrees eventually came.  I ordered the Lambshank ($24) and my boyfriend ordered the Pork ($26).  The lamb fell right off the bone and I didn't even have to use my knife!  It came with a side of Israeli couscous, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  My only complaint about this dish would be the sauce.  It was a harissa spiced vegetable ragout with dried fruits.  For some reason I was expecting something a little thicker.  I felt like the lambshank was sitting in a soup.  Actually, this sauce DID taste like a vegetable stew my mom used to make when I was little that I didn't like.  It was a little bit of a turnoff to me, but not their fault I guess.  (How were they to know?)  I ate it anyway because the meat was cooked so well.  My boyfriend's pork tenderloin was also cooked very well.  It sat atop a bed of risotto and also came with asparagus.  I tried a bite of it, but my dish was so flavorful that it tasted bland in comparison so I can't give it a fair review.  He said it was excellent and finished every last bite on the plate, so I'll take his word for it. 

The service was....ok.  It was fine in the beginning but while they were out hunting for our food between the salads and entrees we were completely neglected and left thirsty.  After we got our entrees it picked up again and was fine until we left.     

The ambiance?  Quaint and pretty, yes.  But quaint does not necessarily equal romantic in my book.  We were seated in a small table jammed into the corner.  The size of the table was fine for two people, but it was way too close to the table next to us which had a party of four seated at it.  Every time someone got up from it to go to the restroom, their backs were right in my face.  We had a nice view of the patio out the window right next to us.  That was until another couple was seated right on the other side of the glass.  My boyfriend felt very uncomfortable for half of our meal because he felt like he couldn't look to his right or else he'd be looking straight at the guy sitting inches away from him.  I was lucky enough to have been seated right next to the wall so I had the view with a little bit of privacy.  The room could have also benefited from some white noise in the background because we could hear everyone's conversations and felt like we couldn't talk at a normal volume without other people hearing.  There was some very soft music playing in the background but it could have been turned up a notch or two.

In a nutshell, I'd give the food four stars but the ambiance and service two and a half stars.  I'd go there again to give something else on the menu another try, but I'd request a table on the patio to get out of that cramped little house.",0
"Costco Travel - My husband and I recently returned from a trip to the Big Island, HI that we arranged throught Costco Travel. After shopping around I found that their prices were the best and after one phone call I was able to make all arrangements for airfair, condo and car. They didn't have arrangements with any B&Bs on Hilo but were able to adjust our travel dates. Everything went according to plan with all arrangements being accurate. Condo was outstanding and a great value. We got gas and did some souvenier shopping at the Costco in Kona and again saved $$.   I've shopped at Costco for years - now becoming a groupie!",1
"I am not usually a fan of botanical gardens. They seem too precious, too ""perfect"" to be of much interest. And, let's face it, flowers and plants are beautiful things, but when you pay to look at them in neat rows, something is lost.

That said, Desert Botanical Gardens is an exception to this garden cynic. Many of these cacti look like they are from another planet, like something you would see in a sci-fi film and say, ""wow, it's too bad those crazy plants don't exist."" They sprawl out on the ground, weaving and turning every which way, or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground. I never knew such bizarre life forms existed, or that some cacti look like trees.

The gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail, lizards, or a jackrabbit or two. Various species of bird can be seen here as well, especially at dusk. I especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests they've made in the upper arms of cacti.

This place never grows old. It's a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town, and because the cacti have been collected from around the world, a cool botany lesson for us all here.",1
"This is not a fancy place.  It's address is on Scottsdale Road, but it's easier to get to from Shea, about a block east of Scottsdale.  It's split into two sections.  As you walk in, if you head to the left, there is a bar with a couple of pool tables.  I can't really say that I've spent any time in that section.  We head to the right, where there is a central bar, with booths along the walls.  If you are into Karoake, this is a great place to go.  The DJ has a great voice, and many of the usuals do as well (of course there are quite a few who don't, but that's to be expected).  We've been here dozens of times, and never not had a good time.  It's casual, and very reasonably priced.  The food is way above average for this casual of a bar.  The shrimp are spiced to perfection, and the chili is to die for.",1
"VOODOO Chicken was fantastic!  Most of the entree selections were available over rice or pasta.  They had many gluten free options and they use brown rice and brown pasta. I stumbled upon Jaspers Peak Bistro on accident and I am glad I did.  Cajun inspired food cooked well.  Very satisfying and delicious.

The server was a bit neglectful, but we were loving our food so much and the company of friends that we didn't mind so much.  The neglectful server did recommend the food we ordered and we were very happy with it.",1
"Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had. Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic. I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back.",0
"Great place to have a meal with family, can be a little on the loud side cause ita always a busy place, recomend calling ahead and getting name put on waiting list, reservations party of six or more only price range moderate, but well worth it",1
"I came here for the first time ever on Mother's Day. They were packed ,the line was out the door and down the path. Still they managed to get everyone seated and quickly attended to.
We were a party of 10  our server was so great and i am sorry to say i do not remember her name. She had all 10 drinks refilled continuously. Brought us lemons and cleared the table with amazing speed, as well as taking care of a completely full restaurant packed with Children that were running under foot.   The only down part was that they had plastic dishes but, with all those people what are your choices.
I loved the food. I had shrimp and fish and vegetables.  Nothing fried.       The best part for me was the Chocolate fondu!!  Although there were many different choices. You could never say that you did not like what they were serving.  have seen a million adverts for this place and i am happy that i finally got to go.",1
"Incredibly good calzones; friendly service, nice courtyard seating.",1
"For opening night, there was a giant wave of people coming through the door.  The bar was dimmed in red and purple lights.  The bright new white dining tables were ready to be eaten on.  All new upscale posh furniture in the bar, dining area, and patio.  We were not able to get dinner but we'll be back.",0
"Went here because of a groupon, will probably not go back without one.  

Cons:
Overpriced, flat out.  Plus, like other reviewers have said, they RUN OUT of a lot of good stuff.  Also, I know this is something small, but as their menu changes, they should update it online.  Had I known the menu would be so different, I would have waited for another week to get a meal I would ACTUALLY want (as opposed to settling).  Also, we had reservations and had to wait 20 minutes.  Not a huge deal, but a personal pet peeve.

Pros:  
The food was good, but like I said, overpriced.  Since I had a deal, I didn't mind as much.  Atmosphere is nice, and I loved the extras (we got a few small tasting, palate cleansers?).  The cotton candy was fab, and though the strawberry dessert was NOT my first choice, it was truly delicious, and I may go back JUST for that dish!  I love the location, and the staff was incredibly friendly, informative, and courteous.  

Knock down the prices and I'd give it at least 4 stars!",0
"As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale, the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch. At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio. Other than the ambiance, the food is some of the best fresh local food I've tasted. A personal favorite is the Free Range Chicken with Goat Cheese... Can you say tasty? My mouth waters just thinking about it. Walking in, the crew at the Herb Box is some of the friendliest you'll ever meet (and the funniest). When you go, make sure to save room for dessert... the cheesecake of the moment is always a win!",1
"Well, our initial plan was to go to Tuck Shop as I've been wanting to try it out. Unfortunately two ladies got there 1 sec before us and got the last table, the waiting area was packed with a group just hangin' and they had a 16 ppl reservation for later. There had sitting available right away at the bar but I'm pregnant and my back is killing me so bar stools were out of the question. They were very apologetic, which I thought was nice considering if wasn't their fault. I'm glad they're doing well. So I asked my husband if he wanted to try District and off we went. Actually, I made a reservation in case something happened and well, we ended up there.

Nice and spacious, not crowded at all.  They were part of AZ restaurant week and we ordered from that menu.

Shrimp sliders- I loved them! They should have a big version of it!
Duck quesadilla- Very good as well, but I'm partial to anything with goat cheese.

We both got the country chicken steak and it was really good. Mine came 1 med, 1 small pieces instead of a big one. The med piece was a bit dry and the breading was slightly burnt. The smaller one was perfect, juicy and crispy. The breading flavor was really good, slightly  spicy. The biscuits were awesome!! More of a cake-bread texture, light and fluffy and kind of sweet. Green beans were tasty as well.

Strawberry shortcake whoopie pies with lime basil sorbet ( I think it was a sorbet)- It was good, but not something I'll order again. The pie filling was too sweet, even the tartness of the sorbet couldn't help it.

Service was prompt, no hovering or having to wait for too long and our food came at a perfect pace.

Great dining experience and it made me forget about Tuck Shop. I still want to try it though.",1
"Bleh. 

I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot, since I frequent the other spots on the same corner.  I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postino's or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru.

I ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldn't even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friend's caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one! 

Our service was fine.  Helpful enough in the beginning, but I think once she sensed we weren't thrilled with our food, she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction.  The waitress never asked me how my meal was... even though I was clearly picking at it, and only ate half of it.  She offered to clear it away - not box it - so, she must have realized I didn't enjoy it.

I will definitely wait a while for a return visit.  Since it is close and has a great layout/atmosphere, I am hoping that they work out these rather large kinks and become the kind of place that I would like to revisit.",0
"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food was amazing,who cares if it's  chain restaurant.
      We had tried to go the night before but they were packd so we made a reservation for the next night.It was really busy when we go there but we were seated immediately.Our server was really nice and very helpful when we told him we had never been there before.
           We ordered the fried alligator app,and loved every bite of it.I had the filet mignon and rock lobster tail.The steak was cooked perfectly and was a good size for the price.I'm not usually a huge fan of lobster but wanted to give it a try,Pappadeux has changed my opinion about lobster,the meat  came right out of the tail.It was buttery andjust plain yummy! It was the first chance hubby and I really had a chance to go out to eat without the kids,so we really wanted to make the most of our time.And we wre definetly able to do that here.Refills kept coming even after we had paid the bill.I also loved the live music from the jazz quartet making its way around the room.The only thing thats keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the tables were too close to each other,and it was so loud I could hear the discussion at the table next to me but I had a hard time hearing my huband across the table.I will definetly be going back to Pappadeux over and over again.",1
"Went for the free ""Movies in the Park Free Family Movie Series"" last night and really enjoyed myself. The park has a giant inflatable movie screen where they show family movies every Friday night at 7 in the early spring months. 

Get there early to get a spot closer to the screen and bring a picnic blanket to relax on. It got a little chilly later in the evening, I would bring a blanket to snuggle under too.",1
"Yay, even though I miss living in Coronado I am glad to be back at the Melrose America's.  If you have read any of my reviews you know how disappointed I was with Coronado America's rude service that I boycotted that particular location.  

Now that I am back around Melrose I can once again enjoy Happy Hour Tacos and drinks, or their delicious breakfast burro and cochata.  If 7th St let you down try 7th Ave.",1
"I've eaten here last year and this is the second year. I finally am able to compare steaks to another location. I love the decoration as it's sports of all kinds. There's always something new you haven't seen before. It's the perfect place to eat and study what is around you.

I had the crusted Parmesan cheese steak. I had tomato bisque and the string onions. Those are good! I had the steak and it felt like it was missing something. I'm not sure what as I don't eat steak a lot. 

The soup was great. It was a cup and perfect. The onion strings were good. The steak was ok. I'll always go back, but not for steak. I also wish their menu was more broad with more items to choose from.",0
"Camus is a cute little trendy bar/restaurant located in the Clarendon hotel.  I came here for a business lunch awhile ago and really enjoyed it.  We were one of two tables though, so service was top notch.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer any and all questions we had.

The chef even came out to say a hello, which I found to be impressive.  The calamari app was excellent and my dish of mushroom gnocchi was amazing. I definitely recommend this place!",1
"Meh....decent Filibertos knockoff but the place feels like a major health hazard considering how new it is.

Just think Filibertos with less quality control and smaller portions.",0
"First, I'm sorry this review is lengthy, but i really want people to understand how far a little kindness can go. 

I entered Mimi's Cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever. I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food. i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out. i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle. She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before. i looked at the menu for some time, unable to clear my mind enough to decide. She told me i was welcome to take a seat, and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley ""where's the fire? take your time, can i get you a glass of wine while you decide?"" wine was a perfect idea! I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine. i waited, and then waited a little longer, Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy, she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine. When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news. Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help. It was just the olive branch i needed. Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better. i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion. finally my food was ready. She boxed everything with care for the drive home. All this time smiling. i couldn't help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange. She had brightened my day, and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimi's Cafe. This is the kicker...my bill was $30 and some change...i gave her what i thought was two $20 dollar bills, but in reality was a $50 and a $20. The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir, I'm not sure these bills are right. i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no, i thought they were two 20's but the difference would be her reward for honesty. The food was tasty and just what i needed. Mimi's Cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table, and if Mimi's Cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in Danielle.",1
"I wasn't that impressed.  The machines look old and rusted, there didn't seem to be any air-conditioning and it had to be in the 90's inside since it was about 110 outside.  They did have overhead fans.  The price was cheap--45 cents per load to wash in a top loader but we only found one top-loader available that actually worked.  Half of them were Out Of Order.  Instead we dumped everything into two front loaders that claimed to do double loads and were out of there in pretty short order.  We took the clothes back to my daughter's apartment building to dry in the laundry room there so she didn't have to stay with them.",0
"I'm sure most people don't go to a fancy steak restaurant for the Mac 'n cheese, but as a mac aficionado, it's practically my duty. And the mac here, well it's high quality. I like to order the lobster mac sans lobster (not a big fan of seafood), which without the seafood, is actually quite inexpensive. Now be warned, this is real heavy mac 'n cheese. It's so cheesy, and thick, and delicious; don't plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it.",1

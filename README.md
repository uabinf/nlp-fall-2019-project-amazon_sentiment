For this project we will be utelizing different product review datasets. Our untagged dataset will be the Amazon Product Review dataset.
We will use this dataset for testing our sentiment classifier. We will also utelize other review datasets (i.e., IMDB, Yelp) that have
already beed classified by sentiment to train our classifier. 

Using different review datasets that come from different sources and are about different products will allow us to perform cross-domain/
transfer learning on our classifier. Additionally, we will be able to investigate what products (from their reviews) have similar 
sentiments or are classified in a similar way.

This project will implement Flair (a BERT NLP Framework on Pytorch) for our sentiment classifiers. Pretraining will be done with the datasets described above, and fine-tuning will be performed in order to achieve the best and most revealing results.

Complaing about a grocery store being crowded doesn't make sense to me since that means people like shopping there. They have no control of it being crowded. If you don't like it crowded, go across the street to Safeway where there is no one shopping there. Then you will see a difference of why Fry's is better. Why is it so busy? Because it has better deals and everyone wants to shop there. It's a positive thing.

This is a roadside haven meant for business travelers (and tourists too stupid to see that this hotel is near NOTHING you\\'re trying to visit Arizona for) to get some damned shut eye. It\\'s a little tough under the current conditions.\\n\\nAside from, you know, sleeping. The rest of this Courtyard is pretty nice. The interior and amenities vastly make up for the absolute desolation outside. It\\'s located off 91st, just north of the 10 freeway. There\\'s a little patch of desert and an ITT Technical Institute across the parking lot that seems too small to handle the amount of folks who need to park.\\n\\nAnyway, back to the inside. This is a newer Courtyard. Marriott is drastically trying to get its old chains into a modernization fit to compete with Hilton and Hyatt\\'s business lines. This renovation, (or new construction in this case) includes adding a \"restaurant\" for breakfast and dinner. And a bar across the way open from 5pm-10pm. Thank God for these two additions because the pickin\\'s around the hotel are slim as a Calvin Klein model. I think there\\'s a Chipotle around the corner. I didn\\'t see you jump for joy. What, not impressed?\\n\\nThe rooms are the modern Courtyard style with LG flat screens, fancy shampoos, interesting art on the walls, wired and wireless internet...etc. This location has low tile showers with glass doors.

Now my companion and I couldn\\'t decide if she worked there or not, she never ordered food and wasn\\'t there long.

If I could give them some advice it would be to get rid of  the HUGE salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections.  I've been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section.  So why spend so much money to have such a huge selection???   Put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value.  And for Gods sake bring back the Mayonnaise Shrimp !!

Pretty sad, I know.  \\n\\nI told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!\",\n"," '\"Fuck you all, we hope you die.\\nThat\\'s the Trojan Battle Cry!\"\\nWow, I can not believe someone Yelp\\'ed PV. \\n My freshman year, my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned. We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.\\n  The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. \\nMan, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon.\\n They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus. \\n They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov\\'t events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it. \\n I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase \"come out of the closet\" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn\\'t need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoo\\'s for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie \"Pump Up the Volume\", which was filmed in the general area.\\n  When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didn\\'t have enough uniforms for the entire team. \\n I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that \"The slaves did not have it so bad\".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. \"If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DON\\'T.\"  \\n \\nThe Good Things I Remember -\\n Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza. My friends  wearing cut out Trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced \"spirit assemblies\" and chanting our own spirit chant of \"Fuck you all we hope you die, that\\'s the Trojan battle cry\".\\n\\n Time has a way of blurring the past, and making it less icky. Yet, my sister is a teacher at North Canyon, and a few years back I went and visited her on campus. The second I stepped into the main building, I felt sick to my stomach. Literally. \\n I hear they have made improvements since I graduated, and I hope so.

Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.  There wasn't even a screen in the theatre - just a white wall.\\n\\nIf they showed new independent movies for $10 and old movies for $5 I think they would really have something cool going on.

The resort includes a pool, a small gym, several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces, and the wonderful Alvadora spa (with massages, facials, outdoor-facing showers, and shaded lounge areas to your heart's content).  There are several mountain trails a short walk/ drive away from the resort, and downtown Scottsdale is 10-15 minutes away by car.

Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority, but I am sure could be ordered if needed.    This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk, there just isnt any here! Only quality sought after items.  Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated.   When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even.  This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen.   There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available.    After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered.   Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in.   If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly, knowledgeable, and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place.   Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby.',\n"," \"This is the closest Pita Jungle to my office.

I'm curious where all the testimonials came from. \\n\\nI have mixed feelings on my experience. In the end, I think I ended up with some beautiful windows, though. My salesperson was very engaging. I felt pretty confident in my decision to go with American Vision Windows after that first experience. There was some miscommunication on scheduling the measurement, but it worked itself out fairly quickly. I started to lose confidence when I was told a specific date that my windows would be in, but never heard anything from the company four days after that date. When I called them to find out where my windows were, I was told they had just received them and they could schedule my install in 2 weeks. Since I only had Saturday install available, that was understandable. The Friday before my install, they called to reschedule to the following weekend because the rainstorm (that just occurred that day) had put them behind two days. Again, I guess that was fairly understandable, but I felt like the peon that was the easiest to push off. \\n\\nLuckily the installers did show up the following Saturday on the earlier side of the provided time frame. I kind of don't know what to say about the install. There were two guys, one seemed to know what he was doing, the other I had less confidence in. The job took 4 hours to install 6 windows. During the entire transaction I was never told how long the install would take, so I'm not sure if that was normal or not. The two guys actually seemed to be fighting during the entire install. I believe the head guy was joking around with the other by basically telling him he sucked. I think the other guy was genuinely getting angrier and angrier. In all honesty, I was very uncomfortable being in my own house while the install was going on. I was a bit disappointed in the cleanup of the job. I ended up having to cleanup inside the window tracks and windowsills on the inside and brush off the sills on the outside. I don't feel I should have had to do that. Before they left, I was handed a survey to review the entire process (salesperson, overall experience, install). I think that is a horrible practice that needs to be changed. I didn't want to sit there writing out a review on all of the above while the installer is waiting for me, and then hand it right back to him. What it did cause me to do is overstate my review because I'm not going to give the installers 2 stars and hand the paper back to the person I just reviewed. \\n\\nI can't say I would recommend this company, but I feel the way customer service has been going, it's really a tossup on what you will get from any company.\\n\\nP.S. I forgot to mention my plants. I have recently spent a lot of my own time and money on landscaping my backyard so this stuck out to me big time. I understand when installing windows it's difficult to pay attention to the foliage below your feet, but I think some attempt to not trample all over the plants would be very much appreciated. For example, when washing the windows, I think an effort can be made not to stand directly on top of a plant and twist your foot back and forth. I'm still hoping I do not loose a couple of plants due to the trauma they endured.\",\n"," \"We have some friend who were RAVING about this place, so we popped in for a sandwich before a movie recently.

Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design.

Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door. \\n\\nThe food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre.

I only dined outside, but honestly with such beautiful weather 9 months out of the year here, why would you dine any other way! \\n\\nThe service was excellent! The staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while I drank water and waited a while for my friend. The menu was amazing. I never once read a menu that I wanted to try everything on here. They had a huge variety of dishes at what I can only describe as American/French fusion. It all looked so divine. And from what I've been told, their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes. So I can't wait to see what they offer when I return. I went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche, fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup. The soup was so rich and creamy, I could have ordered and ate a whole trough! It was that good. The fruit was clean, well portioned and fresh. I'm very particular with fruit, and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened. And the quiche was heavenly as well. Just the right amount of ham and tomatoes with alot of flavor.\\n\\nSince I was here for lunch only, the prices were reasonable.

I had seen this resort from Scottsdale road many times and always thought I would like to stay there sometime. Now I am so glad I finally got the chance. We stayed for 2 nights over memorial day weekend. Upon check in I was asked if I would like to up grade to a king suite for $20 more a night. I said sounds good to me. I figured it couldn't hurt for as cheep as I got the room through Priceline. I cant say enough about how well we were treated at this resort. Some of the other reviews said that this resort didn't have a resort feel. In my experience nothing could be further from the truth. I was treated better here than I have been at many 5 star resorts that I have stayed at in the past. Our suite was part of a 4 plex of suites and while the decor was a little dated it was very plush and comfortable in every way from the couches to the king size bed. The bathroom was very clean as was the entire room. The ground around the entire resort were impeccable. There are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall. The jacuzzi tubs were all very warm and in working order. We didn't order room service but I did browse through the menu and the prices were really reasonable. Everyone we met that worked at the resort was extremely friendly with the exception of one bartender at the poolside cabana bar. Overall I would have rated the entire experience with 5 stars the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of our experience at the poolside cabana. On Saturday afternoon we walked down to the poolside bar area to have a drink and we sat at a table near the bar. We were ignored by the bartender for over 15 minutes while he talked to some young girl in a bikini who was already done getting her drinks. When we were finally acknowledged we asked him if he knew how to make a certain drink he quickly replied no what else do you want in a very rude manner. We each ordered some Orange drink that was on special and it was terrible. So I am taking a half star for that experience and a half star for the extremely high price of wi-fi. It would have cost nearly $13.00 a day so we decided to pass. Thank God for our smart phones. Overall we really loved our weekend at this resort and would definitely return  especially for the great price we got through Priceline although I never did get a chance to see a regular room and I wonder if our experience would have been as good if we hadn't upgraded to the suite.\",\n"," 'I am a bonafide book junkie. Libraries are my mecca. But, I\\'m picky. \\n\\nGetting a SPL card was a cinch. I only needed one proof of residence, although I brought the recommended three, including a Netflix envelope. \\n\\nOnce I had my card, I was ready to explore. I headed first to the public computers that help you locate books... yes! With scraps of papers and mini-pencils handy, I was good to go, once I had selected a couple books to hunt down. \\n\\nSo far, so good.\\n\\nBut then the library got tricky. Running out of the alphabet before I had found my book. Turning into another section - from Fiction to Large Print. WTF?

Really? \\n\\nThis library isn\\'t browsing-friendly like others I have seen. Even the ol\\' library in Stillwater, Oklahoma was more comfortable than this one.

I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details\",\n"," 'Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food.

At first glance you ask yourself how many Indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain? Well the answer is, the turquoise market in Old Town seems to be doing quite well. So it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon David's Hamburger's and Mexican Food. So for me the idea of killer burger and tasty Mexican good is a match made in heaven, were talking major food groups here. \\n\\nTucked between 2 galleries, David's is a blink and you'll miss it kind of place, very unassuming and humble. Inside you won't be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable. With TV's at both ends of the hall like space, you'll be entertained by performance videos of 50's era rock 'n roll. \\n\\nI usually don't write much about soda pop, well never, but in this case the Cherry Coke ($1.95) was kind of special. When you order a Coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry. David's version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal. \\n\\nOf all the ways Mexican style meat is prepared, the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite. If you enjoy this as much as I do then Id suggest the Carne Asada Nachos ($8.59). A massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. While basic, I ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate. If you'd like salsa on your chips, be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa. \\n\\nNow who doesn't like a big juicy hamburger? David's doesn't disappoint with David's Single ($5.99), say that 2 times fast. A 1/3lb patty topped with the usual suspects, then dressed with David's creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of Thousand Isle dressing, adding a layer of tangy goodness. Along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade ($.99) to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden French fries. For dipping I a side of David's sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup. \\n\\nThe Patty Melt ($7.25) is classic diner food. We're talking thick ground beef patty, melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread. The wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture, for me this is what a patty melt is all about. Of course the Guacamole Burger ($6.25) with its pepper jack cheese, bacon and guacamole is the marriage of Mexican and American influence. \\n\\nIf you're an early riser, David's also serves breakfast like Bacon Pancakes ($6.75) and Coconut Waffles ($6.25). Someone please pass the syrup. My only question, where is the breakfast burrito?\",\n"," 'This is a great Radio Shack.  The staff are older, and very knowledgeable with their product line.

Nonetheless, it's important to know (especially for Dave B., who obviously didn't do his research) that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great, creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine.  He decided this 17 years ago, and, despite pretty much breaking even (it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no, the ads do not cover the full cost), continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness.  Notice that the photoshoots use local designers, local models, local photographers, and local locations.  The articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries, businesses (like restaurants) and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means, and about up-and-coming events like the taco festival (started by a local), fashion shows (again, utilizing local designers and run by locals - no Dillard's show coverage here) and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community.  If the magazine doesn't seem critical enough, it's because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about, and therefore don't have to waste pages with hateful criticism when Java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer.  When it's run by a local, written by locals, and put together in the publisher's dining room, I can't think of any magazine with MORE credibiilty and freedom.  The publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is.  That's why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the Crescent Ballroom.  That's also why you'll read the backstory on five locally owned, little-known coffee houses at far ends of the valley.  The candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasn't been written about, or to local artists, designers or patrons of the arts.

Unfortunately, the burger was also well, well done, and I had ordered medium. I should have sent it back, but was hungry and didn't want to wait.

Very opulent without being ostentatious!. \\n\\nWe both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving. \\n\\nWe started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie\\'s ordered. (I\\'ll go back during baseball season :-) ) \\n\\nAfter ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as \"cajun-style, but not overwhelming\". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce. \\n\\nThe result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table.

Either call it \"Dominick\\'s\" or \"Lincoln Avenue\", but not both.

Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A \"2\" brought me to La\\'s Thai Cuisine!\\n\\nPeeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren\\'t, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...\\n\\nSmells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren\\'t) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.\\n\\n#17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar\\n\\nCulinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. \\n\\nNinja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.\\n\\n\\n# 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal\\n\\nCulinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even \"fenced in\" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.\\n\\nNinja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it\\'s that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.\\n\\n\\n# 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami\\n\\nCulinary Thought: I don\\'t like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.\\n\\nNinja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.  \\n\\n\\nCoconut Ice Cream: Yum\\n\\nCulinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.\\n\\nNinja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy.

With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.\\n\\nLast Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.\\n\\n I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law.\",\n"," 'Finally another downtown lunch option.

Not enough salads for my taste. \\nCompared to Arrogant Butcher and likely Tilted Kilt, the menu has less salads and less fried foods, but it\\'ll be hard to find something healthy to eat.  It veers towards the comfort food side, with options like chili with cornbread souffle, and flatbreads served with burrata fondue.

Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.\\n\\nThere were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.\\n\\nOccasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.\\n\\nThen something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.\\n\\nYes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.  \\n\\nOf course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.  Thanks for taking the ass out of Christm.\",\n"," \"I really expected crappy food, because, after all, that's what sports bars generally offer.  Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!

But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco they'd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational.\\n\\nAlso, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight.\\n\\nSo why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item.\\n\\nAnd one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.\\n\\nSo you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.

I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later...

Hello!  We were all starving and got right to the point with our orders: I started with the cucumber soup and no amount of yums or mmmmms can fully describe the delight that was set before me. A cold soup, this is made with cucumbers, buttermilk, dill and olive oil, with chunks of lump crabmeat and a dollop of caviar thrown on top, because why the hell not?!  Also, the soup came in a really large bowl and I was full by the time I finished it. I did soldier on to my main course which was the Moules Frites which is what I had the first time I came here and is a truly inspired dish with juicy fresh mussels, and a broth with thyme, garlic and perhaps a little white wine. Then to add insult to injury they serve the huge casoulet with a hearty portion of herbed french fries that were the perfect crispness and didn't leave oil on my hands. \\n\\nSadly I had to leave some of those friends behind, but only because it was time for dessert! I chose pot de creme which is normally topped with brioche. I requested a brioche-free pot and it was no problem. I was served a tiny ramekin of creamy custard topped with a sort of peanut butter syrup/creme and three slices of caramelized banana. It was really yummy though within 10 minutes my heart was racing from all the sugar. \\n\\nI will point out that this dinner took 2 full hours (we left at 11:30PM) making this the longest I ever spent in a restaurant (3.5 hours are you kidding me?) which is why I ultimately docked one star.

For those of you who may not like those flavors they offer regular fries as well. \\n\\nSeeing that I hadn\\'t eaten since morning I also ordered the Arizona devil dog. This had guacamole, tomatoes, jalapenos, habenero cheese and a spicy chipotle sauce all on an all beef hot dog. I liked it.

Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that\\'s ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.\\n\\nThis place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I\\'ve been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don\\'t think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven\\'t the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I\\'m talking about \\'The Persian Room\\' in Scottsdale).\\n\\nI just don\\'t understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. \\'Good bread\\' and \\'Arabic bread\\' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don\\'t taste fresh.\\n\\nIf you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn\\'t bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.\\n\\nI usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I\\'d get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best \\'persian kabobs\\' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can\\'t stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.\\n\\nI know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If you\\'re weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting.',\n"," \"They are the best!  99% of my pain in my back is gone, thanks to Patrick O'Brien and assistant Joshua.\\n\\nBonnie Wills\",\n"," \"Again, it's a bit unfair of me to rate this restaurant because I'm from San Jose/Cupertino but I'm gonna do it anyway.\\n\\nSo, being from San Jose/Cupertino, I've had me some good Chinese food and even better dim sum.

And, while I find Nick S.\\'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn\\'t be entirely dismissed either.\\n   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony\\'s operates on the \"European Standard\". So ,if you\\'ve ever been, you know. If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to \"pass\" on visiting Tony\\'s. I\\'d assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we\\'re all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters. Do you do calamari, or not?\\n   If you\\'re of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony\\'s for the cultural experience. I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service. Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask. Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto.\\n   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry. Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn\\'t diminish the faded, festive charm in the least. Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me. See the vintage (\\'50\\'s?) black and white photo of Elvis w/some past friend or relation. Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of \\'09.\\n   I admit that not everything at Tony\\'s is superfine, or to everyone\\'s particular taste. I don\\'t especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced. I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown. I\\'ve found outdated items at AJ\\'s, Fry\\'s, and  almost everywhere else.  It happens.\\n   If you\\'re up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide. I \"second\" the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @$2.15 is a bargain. (compared to $7 at Aiello\\'s restaurant on Central, which I haven\\'t tried.)\\n   Another bargain here is the bulk olives. While I\\'m not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome. With jumbo plain greens @$3.50lb., and Greeks priced at the upper end of $5.49lb., you can pay $11 and up for the same thing elsewhere. Let the Snoot in you decide.\\n\\n   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives.\\nThey\\'re black. They\\'re ripe. They\\'re wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny. They\\'re salty,(very) not sour. They\\'re earthy, deeply rich, and complex. They\\'re meaty, satisfying, and delicious. They\\'re addicting. They\\'re sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic. They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats. They\\'re seaspray and sunshine; they\\'re sublime. And they\\'re $4.49. Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you\\'re home.. Where the heart is... OR, you can eat them like candy. Try at least ONE in your lifetime.\\n   Sadly, Tony\\'s skips the minced garlic more often than not. If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home. Makes a world of difference.',\n"," \"I absolutely love Chompies!

The idea of tuna with mango seems lovely however there is a total and complete blandness to the way this dish is now served. The former tuna appetizer was far more tempting. Moving onto the Goat Cheese Medallion Arugula salad. My salad was served sans medallion and literally laden with a huge glob of cold goat cheese and some terribly prepared mushrooms. What happened to the warm, crusted goat cheese? Next, we both ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sole. While the sole was prepared well, I do not recall this dish having a cream based sauce in the past. If memory serves me well, the dish should have had a lemon sauce delicately balancing the flavor of the fish. Cream and sole do not make a happy pair!  I am not sure if this was an error or part of the new menu. Okay, and for the piece de resistance we ordered a side of the Sugar Snap Peas which were actually drowning in a bath of some kind of soy and oil sauce.

You are even offered the opportunity to try it out in their back pool, which I\\'ve experienced myself. You just have to fill out a waiver releasing the Sport Chalet from liabilities and acknowledging that you are in good health. Then, you change in your swimming gear and head out to the back to meet the PADI-certified scuba instructor. You don\\'t have to put on much gear. It\\'s just a pair of fins, a buoyancy compensator over your back, oxygen regulator into your mouth, and a mask. You\\'re guided by the instructor as you first swim near the surface and then head deeper into the pool. I did feel really awkward at first, but that\\'s to be expected. As I left the pool and was guided to the front door of the Sport Chalet, the other scuba instructor provided some recommendations on some equipment and indicated they do not receive any commission for the sale of certain products. I totally enjoyed my first scuba experience and recommend at least trying it out at the Sport Chalet. They offer these \"try-outs\" around the spring and summer.',\n"," 'Tasty food, great deals at happy hour..',\n"," \"Good reviews are easy to write.

Wow Freakin' Wow.\\n\\nI have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER. \\n\\nI must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.\\n\\nI went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.\\n\\nWhen we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!\\n\\nThe complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.\\n\\nWe shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.\\n\\nBut you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.\\n\\nAmy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.\\n\\nFor dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.\\n\\nAmy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) \\n\\nIt may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better?

We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best I've ever had.  Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.  Lalibela's was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils.\\n\\nStaff was great - attentive, helpful service.  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesn't compromise on quality or authenticity.  One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - it's a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I don't think it's fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.  I'm used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibela's injera doesn't compete with the flavor of the entrees as much.\\n\\nAll in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to, and I have been to many in the States.  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!  Highly, highly recommended.\",\n"," 'My nephew just moved to Scottsdale recently so me and a bunch of friends brought him here to show him a local bar that he and the girlfriend could come shoot pool, watch football, play volleyball etc...well....we weren\\'t there 5minutes and 2 kids were running around the pool tables, messing up our games and screaming.

There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. \\n1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork.\\nI am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry \"panang\" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees\\' faces.\\nI must also confess my longing for PF Chang\\'s or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Tott\\'s.\\nTott\\'s even has excellent Won Ton soup.

Occasionally, I have stopped into Mill\\'s End for breakfast, specifically because they have crepes on their menu; in fact, their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe.  For reasons explained below, lately I\\'ve found myself just walking past Mill\\'s End, no longer considering giving it my business.  The general issues that I have with this place involve just a couple of basic things; if the owners made the effort to correct these, I believe Mill\\'s End could be a great cafe.\\n\\nI have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors.  It is with all three of these that Mill\\'s End falls short: \\n\\n1)Ambience.  This means that the environment must be suitable both for studying/reading, as well as relaxation.  So, the music playing needs to be something that is non-intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore; sometimes Mill\\'s End has this covered, but other times not at all.  Onto the seating.  It seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995, in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the TV show \"Friends;\" unfortunately, they didn\\'t come close, but there is usually plenty of seating open.  By the way, what is up with pseudo-sexual ice photography on the walls?\\n\\n2)Price.  This is actually my number one problem with Mill\\'s End.  The coffee is reasonably priced, but the food is too expensive.  Anytime I tell someone that I ate there, it\\'s always the same response, \"yeah, their food is good, but it\\'s really pricey.\"  Considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop, I imagine that their business has gone up, but those prices sure haven\\'t dropped.\\n\\n3.Customer service.  The staff has always been just lukewarm.  Look, I don\\'t expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time, I only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality; this has just always been kind of lacking at Mill\\'s End.\\n\\nHonestly, I think this place has a lot of potential, but it seems to be awash in complacency.',\n"," \"This place needs to close their doors, get their act together, and then reopen.

In addition, the server didn't put in my order for my pizza, hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating. One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone else's special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well. The only thing I liked was the beer, and that too took forever and I had to remind my server several times to get me a refill.

It was as if the magic was gone and that the place was showing its age and loosing its \"specialness\". It was really just ok. The chef\\'s talent shows, but too many other let downs. \\nWhen we arrived for our 8:30 reservation the place was crowded. The host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was. We sat down at our table and that\\'s when things started turning out not as well as expected. Seated in a back corner--which I did not mind---I noticed the walls were filthy---scratched and beat up and dirty. That was my view, so of course its all I could focus on.

It was then we were told that they were out of the veal --which of course 2 of us had chosen by then, and that there was only one Skate dish--which of course the other 2 of us had decided on. They were also out of 3 other items. I felt I was back in the old Eleve (located in this same spot)--the food was great there as well---when they did not run out of many items on the menu. They may be ok when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment. \\nGone were the pop rocks that I thought was so fun as an intermezzo, instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us. A simple salad--good--was $15---and most starters are at least that much. Good, but not worth the price. Otherwise, entrees were good--not special, but tasty and served with good presentation. The cotton candy is still there--and still an attention getter. And I still love the desert selections---especially the malt that I had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces. \\nI think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new, beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall.

I asked for flatware, then brown sugar and milk, then inquired about my basket of willow bread.  The waiter said, \"this is the toast that comes with your meal.  I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam.  I decided to stop complaining (cus I had been making ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils).  I put jam on the \"toast\" and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease.  Meanwhile the table next to us (the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful Sunday) was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread, perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments.  I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork (still a veggie after 25 years) and he said again, \"this is the toast that comes with your meal\".

The cashier guy who looked suspiciously like Ray Liotta was very friendly and working like crazy so I'm pretty sure he was the manager if not the owner.\\n\\nThe burger was thick, juicy and cooked perfectly.

So, I missed the huge crowds and rowdy bunch, along with the sun at it's hottest point!  It's about a two to three hour ride from the shuttle drop off point two to the pick up point four.\\n\\nRentals are $14/pp, which includes your tube rental and shuttle service.  This is the all day rate, so if you get there in the morning, you can go back again and again.  It's $10/pp without the tube rental.  You can also rent a tube for your ice chest (styrofoam coolers are not recommended as they float away), which is a must as you need to load up on TONS of water and your beverage of choice.\\n\\nBring along tons of sunblock and reapply often.  Bring a hat though because you'll be glad you did when you see all the sunburn faces around you.  A few old bedsheets will feel like a godsend on your hot tube, so think about bringing those along too!  And bring along a pair of cheap water shoes or old sneakers because it's definitely rocky and you will need to climb out of the river at the end.  Flip flops or loose sandals are not recommended as you see them floating on by in the fast current.  (Don't be foolish and bring your new expensive sunglasses aka 'spies' to show off because you'll look like an idiot when you lose it!)\\n\\nAnd yes, the river is dirty - with river grass, pee, marshmallows, every other kind of food possible, etc.  But you hope with the quick current flowing, that it makes the water less dirty...you hope at least.  And please take your trash with you!  (The shuttle drivers offer decent plastic trash bags for free, so please take a couple with you on the river!)\\n\\nThey require that children be a minimum of 8 years old AND four feet tall before they'll allow you on the shuttles to take you down to the river.  It can be a fast river, but also because of the mostly high school and college aged crowd frequently and dominating the river.\\n\\nIt's open 9 am to 7 pm, seven days a week.  The last tube rental is at 4 pm, and lost tubes will cost you $20 each.  You need a driver's license for every four or five tube rentals.  And no glass containers!  Your ice coolers will be inspected before you're allowed to board!\\n\\nWe're on the lookout for more rivers to float on!\",\n"," \"Food was good. \\n\\nI had the Choppino Fruittas de Mare. Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. \\n\\nKid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. \\n\\nBread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.\\n\\nNow I would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. \\n\\nDecor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with 4 retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesn't fit quite right.\\n\\nKid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it.

It was an issue of \"protecting the thumbs.\" When I told her I didn\\'t like forearms and elbows, she explained that she\\'d never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn\\'t the \"therapist for [me].\" She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn\\'t an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff?

We also played this course back in November when we were here in town and had an equally enjoyable time.\\n\\nThe course is in great shape and we were able to finish our round in around 4-5  hours.  The staff here are very friendly and accommodating and the beverage cart came by around 5 times during our round.  The price they gave us (as return out-of-towners) for a Sunday morning tee-time was incredible - 2 adults at $89 each + $40 rental + FREE junior fees + $15 junior rental.  Other similar quality local courses wanted to charge full fees for juniors for the same tee time, so I really appreciated the gesture. If they keep this policy in tact, this will be my regular course when my son and I come back in town.\\n\\nAs for the course, the early holes are typical resort style holes followed by 5 or so residential public course-style holes. The beauty of this course is the back-9 desert-style holes that wrap around into the south mountain before returning back into the resort with the final par-3 that provides a breath taking semi-panoramic view of the valley from downtown Phoenix to the Superstition Mountains.  I found the back-9 to be short, but very technical, constantly testing my course management abilities - i.e, thought I could hit onto the green (from the whites) on every par-4, but came up short every time.\\n\\nWould definitely recommend this course for other out-of-towners like me who want to get in a quick round on a nice course.

Whether it's a trio of Christmas carolers, a mariachi band or a lively Jazz band, they have bands in every corner lighting up the night!

As a note, for groups, they put an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill, not the standard 18% most other places do.\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as I was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were.

The rice that the combinations get served with is just so-so.  Their chips are fine, the salsa is a little bit weak.  The food quality is average overall.\\n\\nThe service has never been that good.  They're not particularly attentive or personable.  I felt like we were a little bit of a hassle at times.  The last waiter we had advised us to go with a combo plate because it would be cheaper, when it turns out, if you do the math yourself, it was about $3 more expensive.

In fact, she was very polite and concerned about our order (Mine was particularly attentive with replacing and putting on the side of some ingredients, and she and the staff double-checked with me before and afterward to make sure everything was hunky-dory). The food was great, as always; had my first MM calzone, and I actually liked it better than the delicious pizza they have. \\n\\nNo mention of this in my first reviews, as I don\\'t recall going to the bathroom, but their bathroom is great! Ha, maybe TMI for a food review; however, really impressed with the privacy of the stalls.\\n\\nBack to more relevant things, I was confused (though I suppose not off-put) about the happy hour rules (we went after 10, which is advertised as HH); apparently it isn\\'t half-price appetizers on some nights and instead is a slice of pepperoni or something for $3? Not sure I call that a deal, but I guess beers being half-off makes up for it.\\n\\nI was kind of disappointed they didn\\'t have Fall Woodchuck as I went during their fall-themed beers time, but I guess it\\'s kinda a pussy beer anyway (I\\'ll qualify myself by saying I\\'m more of a straight liquor guy, but Woodchuck is my guilty pleasure). The waitress had a nifty hand-written updated list she kept with her, and while I\\'m not a beer man I can appreciate the effort in something like that.\\n\\nAnyway, like I said, they seem to have really improved here and I definitely recommend them; for the food if not the service.

Let\\'s talk about the wine list at this \"wine bar\" --- it was okay but they were out of our first two choices of red - not ideal for a wine bar. Then, we ordered our bruchetta for our table of four and were annoyed when it came out cut in halves. Knowing we were sharing the plate, maybe the waitress should have clued us in? We ended up ordering a second board for the table so we could each try the variety. I do have to say, the bruchetta was good. \\n\\nWe were clearly there for happy hour on a Wednesday night (which I do love goes until 6:30pm) but found it a little rude that the waitress came by six minutes after the mark to ask if we wanted a second round. There was no grace period so we paid full price. We did notice, that our full price glasses of wine were filled to the brim - so maybe 1/2 price = have the wine? \\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong... the place is cute enough, would def seem like a \"fancy date night place\" if I were still in college. I\\'d go again with girlfriends but won\\'t be racing back with my husband. \\n\\nI wish we would have tried more food because that seems to be the key to this place.

Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They weren't cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening.\\n\\nFor the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.

It\\'s epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....\\n\\nEnter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled \"dentists for anxious patients\", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.\\n\\nI went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they\\'re clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didn\\'t even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.\\n\\nFast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now here\\'s my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd\\'s and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didn\\'t try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn\\'t quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!\\n\\nI have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!',\n"," \"I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place.

Someone eventually came by.\\n\\nAfter some of our party left, 2 of us moved up to the bar and asked the bartender a few questions.  No one seemed to know what was going on.

Overall, I think this place has the potential to be a cool spot and truly hope it does well.  If I could offer a few suggestions, they would be:\\n\\n1.  Have a dedicated host(s) greet people at the front door.  Take a hint from Arcadia Tavern.  I have never walked in there and not been greeted by a friendly smile.\\n2.  Get the music in order.

To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.\\n\\nI hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!',\n"," \"I've traveled to Phoenix several times for business trips and stayed at the Ritz. True Foods was my go to spot in Phoenix because it was right across the street from the hotel. I love this restaurant for the casual vibe and healthy food. My favorite dishes are the Edamame Dumplings and the Miso Glazed Black Cod. It was often hard to get out of work for lunch, so coming to True Foods at the end of the day was always a treat. \\n\\nI only wish they had one in San Francisco!\",\n"," \"If you work in an office and have to dress business casual, NY & Co is your place to shop. Some of their stuff can be a bit plain but more often then not, they have modest, cute, stylish, business casual clothes at an affordable price. I don't think I have ever been bugged by a salesperson when coming to this store which is actually kinda nice. I can't stand salespeople following me around chiming in about how cute something is (see my review on Coach in LV). Lastly, they have a great display of accent jewelry which is my weakness. Everything is always really different and fun so I can't resist and usually walk out with several pieces. The next time you are trying to find a place to shop, try NY & Co. There is something for everybody   :)\",\n"," 'burnt.\\nchina china caught fire :(',\n"," 'I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me.....',\n"," 'I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.  And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).  Then Crudo disappeared.  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.  Now it has reappeared, and in a better location.  Oh joy.',\n"," \"If you have to travel to Phoenix (Yay!) then chances are you have to travel through Sky Harbor (Boo!). There's also a decent chance you'll consider traveling on Southwest (Boo!) but as airlines (Boo!) in Sky Harbor (Boo!) go, you can do worse than Southwest.\\n\\nI'm not a huge fan of Southwest, although I'll give credit where credit is due, and that bags fly free thing is genius. Combine one of my least favorite carriers with what is probably my least favorite airport and you've got a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works out in Southwest's benefit. The gates are just as hard to reach for SWest as other carriers, and you're not banished to the edge of the universe for check-in or for baggage claim. They've got a decent presence here, so you may actually find a human who can help should you have a problem.\\n\\nYes, they may leave you stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather (check) or force you to dash across the airport with late arriving flights (check) but every once in a while it's a painless operation.\",\n"," 'This is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town. It\\'s something different that I think real \"Foodies\" will enjoy. Although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped, it\\'s worth going to over and over again. \\n\\nI ordered the Shepherd\\'s Pie Pasty, it was very filling and delicious. Although I had to wait 20 minutes for it, it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty. But if you\\'re ever in a rush, a good thing about this place, is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive.',\n"," '***** The service was fantastic, There was a nice warm lady attending the shop and the Gelato was awesome as always!!! \\n** Yummy Chocolate Caramel Fudge Brownie!! :)',\n"," \"I crave breakfast food all the time, but I want something more than an Ihop or Dennys. Not only is Crackers & Co way better than a mainstream breakfast place, it's actually cheaper too!\\n\\nI ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and it was amazing. It had just the right amount of spice and the portions were way bigger than I imagined. Their country potatoes are awesome and have nice, brown, crunchy edges. I went with a group of 5 people who all ordered different breakfast items and not a single person was disappointed with their food.\\n\\nThis place was not only really cute but also great for the price and taste. Plus, they serve breakfast all day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\\nI can't wait to go back.\",\n"," \"First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didn't seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didn't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sister's bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldn't recommend to ANYBODY.\",\n"," ...]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0PzO5SsaIX3L","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')\n","X = vectorizer.fit_transform(reviews)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vS4rqL5aJ-rZ","colab_type":"code","outputId":"c7273e88-ea54-4473-bb1e-ad3a8655363f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1574119006949,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":4797,"user":{"displayName":"Payton Walker","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCPs1T6TM9X-ZFb3qy-FRZg_09KzlL2RwOi0ldjhA=s64","userId":"07447174154653828546"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":67}},"source":["model = KMeans(n_clusters=2, init='k-means++', max_iter=1000, n_init=1)\n","model.fit(X)"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["KMeans(algorithm='auto', copy_x=True, init='k-means++', max_iter=1000,\n","       n_clusters=2, n_init=1, n_jobs=None, precompute_distances='auto',\n","       random_state=None, tol=0.0001, verbose=0)"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pWUNgrUPKDtH","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["order_centroids = model.cluster_centers_.argsort()[:, ::-1]\n","terms = vectorizer.get_feature_names()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"5LsYMxkhKHAI","colab_type":"code","outputId":"f7303fb8-a84c-47bf-c37b-6969ba5ebc41","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1574119011717,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":238,"user":{"displayName":"Payton Walker","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCPs1T6TM9X-ZFb3qy-FRZg_09KzlL2RwOi0ldjhA=s64","userId":"07447174154653828546"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":386}},"source":["for i in range(2):\n","  print(\"Cluster %d:\" % i)\n","  \n","  for ind in order_centroids[i, :10]:\n","    print(' %s' % terms[ind])"],"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Cluster 0:\n"," place\n"," like\n"," great\n"," just\n"," good\n"," love\n"," time\n"," ve\n"," store\n"," friendly\n","Cluster 1:\n"," food\n"," good\n"," great\n"," place\n"," service\n"," pizza\n"," really\n"," like\n"," restaurant\n"," time\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wIv31LzaKKe4","colab_type":"code","outputId":"4c91c1b0-7d3f-4b9b-b8ec-45f90246fffb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1574119022337,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":246,"user":{"displayName":"Payton Walker","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCPs1T6TM9X-ZFb3qy-FRZg_09KzlL2RwOi0ldjhA=s64","userId":"07447174154653828546"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":84}},"source":["print(\"\\n\")\n","print(\"Prediction\")\n","X = vectorizer.transform([\"That movie was terrible.

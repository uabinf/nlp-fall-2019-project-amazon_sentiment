"I really like this place. However it does suck time like no other place.

Somehow evertime you are there for over 2 hrs?

I usually try on 60 items to get 1 that fits well, and cry a half dozen times about being fat :(

Then I cruise the little kids clothes because the mens clothes are to large for me and the womens are cut weird.

One of my boobs is like a 3rd the size of the other so its soo hard to find clothes that dont make me look like a cancer survivor.

Anyway, good finds here. Try the clothes on even if it says the size is smaller than you wear. A lot of times it says one size but is really another.
My girlfriend bought 200.00 jeans for 20.00 a piece because it said they were a 24 when they were really a 27.


P.S. anyone know where to find some dress vests?

The womens ones are too short and make me look like I have flowing love handles and the mens vests are to big in the shoulders and ribs.

I think I should try maybe a kids vest? thoughts?",1
Horrible service.,0
"I'm a regular at Lux. Haven't reviewed it out of sheer laziness. And it's usually laziness that brings me here: when I have a major thingie to get done by Day B but I spent all of Day A at the office surfing the Internet instead of working on it, I pay the price with an all-nighter, which I like to start at Lux. (Damn them for not being open past 10). This is usually the story when anyone spots me here. 

I'll grab a small table for myself, plug in my laptop (free wifi), spread out my papers everywhere, then go up to the counter for a large and extremely delicious Velvet Latte. When it's done right, there's a perfect swirl of white cream that forms the shape of a leaf on the surface of the caramel-colored coffee. Mmm.

Since I am ADD I take frequent breaks of course. Like every 3 minutes. Whenever I hear a strange piece of music I really like that I've never heard before (this happens often), I strain to catch part of the lyrics, stick it into Google, find the name of the band, stick it into iTunes and download it. I'm not making that up. Like half my music collection was created through this method. The last few bands I downloaded tracks from are... let me open up my iTunes... Kasabian, Feist, and the Detroit Cobras. I'm not even remotely hip enough to have heard of those before on my own.",1
Awesome food and service!,1
"Yup. It's all true. Great food, super charming place, very intimate. 

We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp. Enjoyed the olives as a starter, as well as some fried raviolis (yes, please) and a caprese salad app.  Outstanding artisan pizza, with as good a crust as I've ever had, and homemade mozzarella. Wine was just ok, but very reasonable. Server was attentive, helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful. 

Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats. Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac.

We'll be back, and with more friends.",1
"Many have started out with this and it should be stressed , this wonderful place is TINY! 

Suggest you make a reservation so you get he chance to enjoy the wonderful food that is in store. We started with the stuffed mushrooms , like many others raved about, and the Portuguese style mussels. Both were fantastic and left us wanting to come back to try the other mussel offerings and appys as well. The endless bread was the perfect tool for soaking up the rich juices the mussels were bathed in.  

We're we're pretty full, but thought we would take a run at the Espana pizza. Hands down the best pizza we have ever had. The flavor could not be any better and the perfectly created thin crust let you enjoy the toppings as both a compliment and as a way to get it easily into your mouth! 

Feels more like you have been invited to a friend's house for an awesome meal as opposed to a restaurant. Great people and they went to all lengths to make ours and the other patrons meal fantastic (even the entirely needy, hard to please, and somewhat obnoxious woman seated near us)

While I am sure they would make your super comfortable if you had to wait, suggest you  make a reservation so you can enjoy this great little place",1
"When owners/staff changed we kept hoping for the best.  (The friendly owners/cooks of the previous restaurant were top notch, hence the good reviews).  But now, alas. . . Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork (and bad at that), wontons in soup that fall apart, greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls, it's just not worth it.  Prefer to give locals the business, but this is truly awful, even after many hopeful tries.  Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job.",0
"I'm going to be an uptight stickler here, and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business. I hope others follow suit. Sorry, I'm super nerdy about this stuff.

Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land. I love the flavor and how it's always glistening with oil when it comes to the table. The toppings are really special here. If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza. The lemon zest puts it over the top. The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite. The only one that I haven't liked is the the rocket man. It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust.

We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening. I couldn't get enough of it! It's not on the menu (seasonal item I'm sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by.

Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines. Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, I'm a happy camper.",1
"When I lived in Phoenix, I was a regular at Fez. My friends and I probably averaged twice a week, and there were likely weeks when we were there more. The atmosphere is really wonderful, a rarity in Phoenix. The food is very consistent and almost everything on the menu is unique and flavorful. I must agree with some of the other reviews, that the waitstaff is very hit-or-miss. I've had wonderful service and terrible service, and there are times when I've had to go and ask the bartender to send someone over to our table to take our order... as regulars, in particular, I wouldn't think that this would be something we would have to deal with. That being said, there was one time when they were understaffed and the manager was very apologetic and even sent us a bunch of appetizers free of charge as an apology... so I haven't personally experienced the attitude that others report. I miss Fez... now I live in San Diego. When I go to visit, it's always on the itinerary, every time, usually as soon as I land.",1
The best thing was the dessert. Shrimp was alright. Nothing to write home about. Wesabi chicken was lacking.,0
"We tried Mr Chao's Asian Bistro last night. It's a small place and they do a lot of take-out orders. The quirky interior works fine for me. My wife thought the single gourami looked kind of sad in the small, flat tank on the wall. They have a bar and a decent selection of wine for a small restaurant. I tried one of the specials, the Hunan Smoked Pork. It was basically kind of like bacon stir-fried with fresh vegetables with a spicy Hunan black bean sauce. I love bacon and I really liked this dish. My wife had prawns w/vegetables, we liked the freshness of the vegetables and generous amount of prawns but overall the dish was slightly bland. She liked it but thought that it would have been better with the lobster sauce. We were mixed on the iced tea, my wife felt it was too strong but I thought it was fine. 

Overall, Mr Chao's is a fine choice in Ahwatukee for Americanized Chinese food. It is a bit pricier than our usual stop, Panda Garden, but a nice alternative.",1
"I've been coming here for a little over a year and I can't say that I've ever been really all that impressed.  

Yes, they ""hand wash"" your car but I feel like that's the only pro on the actual cleaning of my car.  I've never really been happy with the vacuuming, not sure that they really do anything other than the mats.  When I get in my car all the old fuzz and hair is still on the seats.  The last 2 times I've been there they've missed cleaning parts of my car and I have to say something.  The last time they cleaned 3 out of 4 of my tires, even a stranger commented to me about how he found it odd they missed it.  Also, asked for air freshener and when I got in my car it still smelled like ummm, well it didn't smell fresh and clean.  I just left there and again I had to ask them clean the inside door.  It was covered in dirt and dead grass, how do you miss that?!? When I called someone over to clean it he then noticed that the wind shield was still dirty.  I mean, really?? And again, no air freshener even though I asked for it.

I gave 3 stars instead of 2 because I do appreciate the fact that this is not a chain.  I'd rather give my money to a family owned spot instead of some corporate junk.   The tall, blonde woman who greats you is always very nice and helpful.  I like that I'm not hounded about getting my windshield or cracks fixed a million times and sometimes they offer deals on LivingSocial which is great. 

Overall I feel like this is a good place to come and just have the surface of your car washed unless you want to pay big bucks to actually see a difference in the inside of your car.  Make sure you check your car before leaving to ensure they have actually cleaned everything.",0
"My husband and I have been going here for a few years now. It is one of our favorite places. Really low key, affordable, amazing food! Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed! I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!",1
"Went last week, and ordered a dozen variety. I didn't care for any of them, very dry, the frosting wasn't very good,even my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out!",0
"My boss took us here for a little Holiday lunch the other day and i have been dreaming about the burger ever since! Seriously, the term ""cheeseburger"" doesn't even to justice to the masterpiece they brought me! And the parmesan and truffle oil fries were amazing, too! The decor is kind of cool, sort of an American Teddy Roosevelt feel... Grand old pictures, deer head, and dark wood mixed with high ceilings and light colors so it doesn't feel all heavy. Ok, back to the food... 

The burger has applewood smoked bacon and grilled onions mixed into the patty. It is incredibly juicy without being greasy! They top it with Havarti cheese, place it on a buttered grilled brioche bun, and serve it with a couple of different sauces... One was like a garlic butter type of sauce and the other was like a horseradish mayo. I ate every single bite and didn't care that i was stuffed to the gills or looked like a pig in front of my co-workers! To leave any bit of that on the plate would have been a travesty!  I can't wait to take hubby here for lunch (dinner would be wayyyyyyy too expensive).",1
"I love the owners.  Very friendly and accomodating.  One night we had called after they had closed, and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.  Turns out they were hosting a private party.  They agreed to take our order, which made us pretty happy.

I adore their Greek fries.  Olive oil, lemon, and the perfect amount of fetta.  Been here several times for lunch, and always leave happy.  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour.",1
"I have found my new favorite sushi spot.

I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.

You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi. 

On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.

The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. ""Hey, fire!"" I thought. It was a nice touch.

Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.

Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi. 

The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time.",1
"I like Blu Burger.  If you're a burger lover and like to have it ""your way,"" this is a great choice for you.  There's a lot of competition in the ""gourmet burger"" market these days.  Delux is the Phoenix original and I'm a big fan.  Stax (in Old Town) is also very good.  I mention these others because, while I like Blu Burger, I wouldn't drive from Old Town all the way up to N. Scottsdale for it....I'd just go to Stax.  And, vice versa.  Blu Burger holds its own and does a great job, but not enough that I'm going to drive all the way across town for their ""take"" on a custom hamburger.

If you've got a group, Blu Burger is good choice for variety.  They have veggie, turkey, and salmon burgers, in addition to salads and sandwiches (egg salad, anyone?).  So, unless your friends are incredibly finicky, there should be something to please everyone.  I also applaud the fact that onion rings and sweet potato fries are available as sides.

All in all, Blu Burgers is 4-stars all the way.  Yummy food.  Friendly service.  They do the gourmet burger thing well and you'll walk away full and happy.",1
Yum! Healthy selections and delicious flavors!,1
"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. I usually go for the turkey wrap or one of their pizzas. On this day we went for happy hour, which is daily after 9pm and tried several tapas and a 4 peaks beer. Everything was really good.",1
"Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling! 
Extras on tables to get your Pho on.. 
Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)",1
"Food was tasty. I ordered the veggie combo, and was a little disappointed that it didn't come with more of a variety of things, especially for $12. BUT what it did come with was good.",0
"I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and I always leave happy and satisfied. I love coming here for the view as it reminds me of home.
 
We came here once again for a special occasion which was a farewell dinner for my mom who was visiting from South Africa. I had made a reservation using Opentable and asked for a nice view as a treat to my mom on her final night.
 
The hostess reserved us a table with a splendid an unrestricted view. We had a very attentive waiter - Luis - who treated us with colorful and informative descriptions of the menu. He also took care of us with an exquisite after dinner treat seeing as how mom was leaving.
 
The dinner was exceptional - as always, so was the atmosphere, the company and the wine. Do go here!
 
I suggest arriving a little before the dinner reservation to enjoy drinks on the patio while watching the sunset...always a treat! Call ahead of time to find out whether the patio will be open - it has happened to me twice that it was reserved for private functions. (Which was totally my bad - but maybe someone else can benefit from it.)",1
"Nice place surrounded by many fast food places. No grease here!  Breads are wonderful, but customer service was just ok.  Great pastries and part of the Belly loyalty program.  Super dog friendly as well with the outdoor seating.",1
"Delicious burger!

They have a massive menu with something for everyone.  My gf got a light basil-pesto chicken with a nicely sweet bread, while I got a southwestern burger and fruit on the side.  This is a gem in ahwatukee.  Walking in, I felt at home because it reminded me of many cafes from Boston; it was clean but with a bit of hip grunge look.  There's a big garage door on the one side of the restaurant that opens out for a large patio in the cooler months.

I'll definitely return here when I make trips to ahwatukee.",1
"I'm a horrible haircut customer. I never remember how I get my haircut and squared or rounded, I just don't keep track. I've been to all of the chains and was thinking that maybe I should finally find just one person to cut my hair for now on until I got a coupon. I really enjoyed my visit, I didn't get the MVP thing cause I wasn't expecting it and I didn't have time for it. They are all pretty knowledgeable and quick. Only once was I not fully happy with the cut, but it's hair it grows back. They are a bit more pricey but I always go with a coupon, I get them every month. I'm not the most talkative person so it gets kinda awkward when you sit there in silence so I love that you can just sit there and watch sportscenter.",1
"No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile. 
A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did.
However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.

Yes, mold.

Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.

Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.

*ETA
MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.",0
"I'm giving this place 2 stars because it just doesn't have it.  
First off, the energy in this place is lacking.....the food isn't anything to write home about and seriously, I could of made better in my own kitchen.  The SPINACH CON QUESO DIP was ok, but the chips that came with it were stale and the CHICKEN AVOCADO SANDWICH was dry and came out like a burger not a sandwich......The Skinny Margarita's are horrible and lack tequila and the bartender doesn't know how to make a good martini to save his life!
As for the staff?  Well our first waitress was a little too friendly and just about sat in my husbands lap....oh, I know that a little flirting comes with the job and is what you do to get a better tip, but come on honey, how did you know that I was not paying for that dinner?  If I was, the only tip you would of gotten would of been a 'back off a little on the whole, I have daddy issues in flirting'!  I have to admit though, once we changed seats after our dinner and went into the lounge area of the Bungalow, our waitress knew exactly what she was doing when it came to her job and her flirting was exceptional.....she knew how to work it while still being a classy lady, and I respect that! 
As for the clientele of this place, it's a younger crowd full of loud drunk guys at the bar watching the football game.  What you expect in a sports bar.....Outside the crowds quieter and more tolerable.
All in all, I won't be back and I won't be recommending this place to any of my family or friends!",0
"Easy 5 star fun at the Phoenix Zoo. I've never seen critters so closeup before. At the Monkey Village, they don't even have cages. The giraffes came right up to us. I spent half my beer money on fishheads and shrimp feeding the stingrays. It was a blast!

We had great time!
yow, bill

PS - I've never commented on other people's reviews before. But jeez. When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone... well, for spider monkey's sake, get a clue!",1
"Old Town Scottsdale has a personality disorder. It tries to be one thing during the day and another at night. Merchants are gouged for hellish fees in order to provide the ""free"" parking so prices reflect this big gouge as some have to make up six figures per year (no joke). During the day Old Town caters to the typical tourists with skin that hasn't seen the sun since Eisenhower was president. The little shops sell a combination of crap and genuine goods. Restaurants cater to the over 60 crowd for lunch and the idea is to keep people milling around until they have spent all of their money. The perimeter of Old Town is alive with baseball, a hospital, banks and other real world establishments. At night the ""clubs"" open and each one thinks it's the Viper Room or the Abbey. Sorry, this isn't LA. High cover charges for lame, watered drinks and dead ambiance won't cut it. They make up for being dull with loud music. The rooftop bar concept seems to be dying off after locals who can't sleep through the racket take a few shots at the places from time to time. I can't blame them. A mile away the noise from these places is still thumping loud. It must be horrific to be at one of those rooftop bars. 

But to be fair, Arizona is not known for night life. It's a place where the sidewalks are rolled up at dusk and they try to cash in on big events like the occasional Super Bowl. They also try to create a night scene Studio 54 style with a new ""hot""place popping up and when it is no longer trendy, they change the name and it becomes something else. Restaurants in Old Town also change names in the summer in hope of fleecing the same crowd the next tourist season. Many are now corporate-owned and the local restaurants have had no choice but to follow the downward spiral. 

On the up-side, look for the local bars and by that I don't mean clubs. The bars such as the Blue Moose are locally owned and serve up good food at decent prices, good drinks and offer friendly service. Stay away from the $30 per entree places and just go cheap and have a good time. 

If you are the sort who likes to drop $15 on a well drink with a bunch of plastic people who are keeping up appearances with the last of their Visa credit line, AZ88 is the place to go. :)",0
"Nooooooooo!  Curse the the gods of all that is delicious, for Huauchinango is now CLOSED.  Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that.  So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound.  So, I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon.  Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed.",1
"I split the veggie platter with a friend and we only got just over half way through it.  Got the rest to go.  I couldn't wait until I had room to eat again so I could eat the leftovers.  Sooo much good stuff.  I'm usually not a glutton, but there are a precious few places where I lose all self control and beach myself and this is apparently one of them.
We were there for an hour and half and asked all sorts of questions about how things were made and what they were.  The lady that waited on us may have been the owner.  She was cheerful and happily indulged our questions.
It's a large restaurant with plenty of seating for large groups, but it also seems to be an authentic family outfit.  They have a few beers in bottles and apparently authentic music.
I'm sad that I'm moving out of this neighborhood right as this moved in!  If I weren't leaving, I'd probably give up cooking entirely and just eat here every day, or try to get take-out.
If you're downtown or on the east side of Phoenix, it's worth the trip.  Really good ethnic places outside of the Italian/Chinese/Mexican/American mold are a treasure here in Phoenix.  If you're from somewhere more metropolitan, you know what I'm talking about.   West Bring friends, dates, clients, and employees here and impress them.",1
"This is the place for a fabulos breakfast!! I have friends who visit from Texas and they wait all year to eat the Eggs Benedict here. They are the best. I  personally love the pancakes smothered in bannanas, pecans and hot syrup...yummmmy. They also serve some very healthy and delicious salds for lunch like the strawberry spinach salad and the sandwhiches ar e very good, Their is often a wait for breakfast but it moves fast and their is a community table which sometimes shortens the wait.",1
"After reading a lot of the reviews, my expectations were pretty high.  I'm a pretty big burger lover, will even order one in a fancy restaurant if I think it'll be good in that particular place.

The burger was ""ok,"" a disappointment compared to what I thought I'd be getting.  In fact, it tasted EXACTLY like Burger King.  It even looked like a Burger King hamburger (which in my opinion is not good at all).  The fries were delicious, plentiful and seasoned very nicely.  They did their job quite well.

The interior of the restaurant is fun, light-hearted 50's retro diner for sure. It's a good time to look at the pics on the wall.  They put a lot into the look of the place and it shows.   Also, the staff was fast and helpful and my order was ready in no time at all (and I was there during lunch rush!).

So, in all - a good lunch place for cheap and a fun dining experience.  But don't drive all the way down here for the burgers if you live far away.  They are average at best.  Frankly, if you're up for driving and want a good burger, you're better off at FatBurger (Mill ave) or try the burger at Jilly's up in Scottsdale (very good).",0
"This place is fun for drinks. Although, I wouldn't suggest eating here... My friend and I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I love tomato soup - even cheap stuff in a can... but what they served us didn't even resemble soup at all! Without any exaggeration, it was literally pizza sauce. I hope it was some sort of mistake... but who does that? Puts straight pizza sauce in a bowl with a spoon? I had been drinking all night and was starving and still couldn't eat it. That being said, the staff here was great and the service was really fast.",0
I am not going to complain about the quality of my manicure! They did a fabulous job...On the other hand their customer service was a little off. Very unorganized and they could just not get it together. It took them forever to assist us since we didn't have an appointment and are not regulars.,0
"So Wednesday evening I needed milk and cat food. On my way to the store I realized my stomach was growling. Never a good idea to shop on an empty stomach. A while back in The Savvy Shopper rag in the China Grill ad was a little banner about Wok n Stix being a new location. And because of an event that fell apart this week I had a bug to eat something Asian. So I found it and stopped in.

Chinese fast food. They also have hamburgers and a few other things. I stuck with something I figured I would like, orange chicken ($7.95). It came reasonably quick, was too hot to eat right away. Most of my Chinese fast food consists of Panda Express and Ming Gee. This was much better, in addition to the onions and bell peppers listed mine had mushrooms, celery, sprouts and some other stuff. Service was on styrofoam with plastic utensils. Even though I was eating in the rice came in a take out box which I thought was sorta weird. I still hate eating out alone but at least I wasn't the only person in the place. Each side of the place had a long upholstered bench with tables and chairs that could be slid along to make up different seating and two tables in the middle.

There was nobody being served at the front counter when I was finished so I stopped,picked up a menu and talked to the woman there and found out she is an owner. They have had the place for 6 months and are the same family that owns China Grill not far away.",1
"I'd have to disagree with the person who said this restaurant is dog friendly.  I was told off by the owner because I had a little dog outside table and that was right after I finished paying for an overpriced breakfast dish and coffee.  I went here before that on several occasions and many times my order was forgotten, after paying....and the staff is real unprofessional blasting music at nightclub volume at early breakfast and lunch times.  I'm a neighbor, but will never go here again!!!!",0
"I'm rating this place as a Music Venue and Bar, not as a restaurant. 

UB's seems to be hosting a slew of Metal shows over the next 3 months, which is good to see a place open it's arms and bar to the metal community. 

As far a heavy metal venue goes, its run of the mill. It has enough room to either mosh or sit in the booths along the back wall. 

As far as the bar, the prices seemed slightly on the high side, especially for the ""dive-ness"" this place exhibits. 
Their beer menu had 4 or 5 typos on it, just something to chuckle at, such as Rolling Rook beer, O'Dools, and listed Fat Tire as an import. (Cuz Colorado is SO FAR way). 

Luckily, beer and metal go together, so people tend to pay. 
The old man in the Bolo tie checking ID's was definitely a good sport.",1
"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.

The crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?

When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  ""oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill""

I said forget it, keep it.

i usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.

  yeah, really worth losing a customer for?

my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.

gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)

$2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.

as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)

so in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?

it's the chinese way i guess

back to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace.

will you forgive us? haha",0

"Being a total Asian bobaface in a generally boba-deficient state, I adore this joint.  The chocolate mint smoothie is always on my mind if I'm in the Tempe area or passing through on my way north.  I dig my boba firm and chewy, so I always ask for the drink to be made extra icy to chill the little pelotas to ideal suppleness.  Eba has a pretty large menu and will gladly do flavor combinations.  They use the proper plastic seal on the tops of the cups so you can shake the living daylights out of the drink (as one should).  

Also, Eba has free wi-fi and is close to the airport; it's our favorite pre-flight stop to do a final check of email.",1
"I will tell you exactly why this place is so great.

This place will blow your mind.  Not only is the service good, but the food is amazing.  

Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____berto's.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-12 hours. Talk about regret. Don't do it.  Like a child of abuse, you have the power to stop the cycle.

Say ""Nah"" Like the famous sunglasses kid, ""Let's go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food, amazing service, and keep drinking to boot.""  You will be a hero. You will make Ironman look like AquaMan (He's a Chump.  ""You sir, command that fish into this taco.""). 

Short list of amazing things to be had here:
1. Margaritas.
2. Mi Patio Taco. Not a taco and not a burrito. What is it?
3. The Chips and Salsa 
4. Chicken Tacos.  
5.  Ice Tea. 
6. Pacifico",1
"3 stars for a great happy hour. 1 extra star for having happy hour 7 days a week (from 3pm-7pm). If more places did happy hour every day of the week, I'd be drinking and eating all the time...oh, wait. 

Anyway, here's the happy hour download: 
-Wine by the glass: $2 off
-Domestic bottles: $3
-Draft beers: $4
-Sangria: $4
-Specialty Cocktails: $7

In addition, they also have multiple food items at the $4, $6 and $8 price points. 

We sampled the ""Lemoncello"" (in quotes because it should be ""Limoncello"" - note to management) martini as well as the Grapefruit Basil Fizz. Both were delicious, although the basil one was definitely the best. For food, we had the spinach artichoke dip and the arancini (rice balls). Neither was amazing but a great value for the money. 

I thought the service was attentive and efficient, although the food runners needed to learn which spot at the bar was which table number since they kept delivering other people's food to us. 

Finally, while this has zero impact on my review, there is a very bizarre picture of a dark-haired shirtless man with dark chest hair in a very flirtatious pose hanging in the women's restroom. As my Facebook friend pointed out, it looks more like bad 80s porn than restaurant wall art. While entertaining, it probably makes sense to replace with some generic pic of the Colosseum or something!",1
"I am very particular about where I go for sushi.  I can name ten places I will not go to, and have struggled to find a place to frequent; until now.  I have only been here about 5 times, but every time was a great experience.  Great food, staff, prices,and atmosphere.",1
"Oh Porter, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... 

I had a, ah, as in just one, porter and was feelin' fine. And I was extremely glad to have the sweet potato fries instead of the regular ones with my sammie. Our waitress was pleasant, prompt and next time I'm going to ask to be seated outside or at a high top table. Our booth was great for chatting with my friend, but I like a little people watching at the pub!

Now, if you are avoiding SunUp because you remember that there used to be something called  the Sonora Brewhouse in that same space.... You're in luck!! The brewmaster, Uva, is still there, still brewing his witches draught. But now, you won't get them confused with the Sonoran Brewing Co. in north Scottsdale. Hooray!",0
"I'm not a sushi expert by any stretch, but suffice to say that the rolls here are well-priced, fresh-tasting, and overall pretty damn delicious, with good presentation. 

I'm not a fan of their tea, but that's just a personal preference, I think. I enjoy the Las Vegas, but the Spank Me roll was really good as well. We usually mix and match our way around, and right now they're running a ""happy day"" 4pm-9pm special on a lot of their rolls which makes them cheaper by $1-$3, each. Definitely worth it.

Good service, laid back vibe, even if the decor is a little ""college dorm"" with the lighting, but overall, fun, good food, and affordable.",1
This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop I've seen in Arizona.  They serve beer too.  Problem is that the espresso was unbelievably bitter.  Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though.,0
"I haven't been here since they renovated but the previous decor was great.  Elegant open areas, great atmosphere.

Tried almost everything on the menu with the owners one night and everything was amazing.  I'd be there more often if it were closer.

They can also do private parties on their outdoor patio, and offer drink/music service.",1
"I really (REALLY) like The Lodge so I was gonna give it 4 stars. To be honest though, I really can't think of any good reason NOT to give it that 5th star.

I've mostly been here for Happy Hour when visiting AZ, but I've also stopped in a few late nights, and have always had a good time.

The Lodge has one of the best Happy Hours (deal wise) in Old Town. All apps (except the mac & cheese and fried pickles) are half off along w/$2 cheap drafts, $3 Lodge signature drafts (which is a tasty beer) & $3 wells (stuck to beer on this last trip, but if I recall in the past they actually use a heavy pour during happy hour).

I've tried quite a few of the apps, and they're all good. The pretzels & cheese are particularly tasty. I always get pretzels & cheese no matter where I am w/the friend I came here w/for happy hour the last time I was here so I can say I've tried quite a few in my day & the Lodge's ranks right up there!

I admit I'm a sucker for cheesy theme bars, so I kind of of dig the ski lodge theme here. the dining room area isn't huge, but is clean w/comfy seats. The bar area is pretty big & the patio is nice, weather permitting. 

I've never had an issue w/the service here & both bartenders & bouncers are always nice.",1
"As good as it gets.  We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service (as usual).  We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth.  When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.  For appetizers, we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.  Overall, just incredible.  Completely up to par with Eddie V's standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.  We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.  For those special occasions or a fun happy hour, Eddie V's never lets you down!  Also, their Banana's Foster is divine!  Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day -- delish!",1
"This is an outer arts district staple in the Valley. The neighborhood is spooky if you don't know the area, but it is worth the possibility of having your car vandalized to stop in. Great live performances, mellow guitar, etc. and fantastic food. Hummus plate, Mm. Greek salad, yum. Cheesecake, yes please. The service is European style so expect to wait and wait some more. Seat yourself inside or out on the lovely patio.

Across from a fun locally-owned boutique you can stop by if you're there earlier in the day. 

I stocked up on the 70% off gift certificates for this little gem of a place at: http://www.citydeals.com/deals-merchant-Paisley-Violin-Cafe-Phoenix-AZ-LOC41462852.html?id=2852

You can thank me later. I'll probably be at the table next to you.",1
"I was here once. A reasonably sized girl broke her white plastic lawn chair and tumbled to the ground. I averted my gaze and tried to focus on my overpriced mediocre eggs benedict. My friend just laughed and laughed. I guess I should have ordered the mimosas, too.",0
"While I'm a sushi fan, my husband is a sushi FIEND - we made biweekly trips to his favorite haunt in NYC (Monster Sushi) and if he was on his own for dinner, I could always count on him to be there for a bite.  After relocating to Phoenix, he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did.

The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens).

No teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy.

Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.  I don't ever mind paying if it's worth it.

Will most definitely come back and hopefully take in some teppan next time :)",1
"Don't get me wrong, White Chocolate Grill is good and definitely a place I will go back to, but there is something that just doesn't click. Everything tastes good and the service is fast and efficient but it is more of a relaxed dinner that a meal you get excited about. I can't say for everyone I really don't like waiting a half hour for a table. Call me impatient I don't care,  I really do not think many restaurants deserve that title even on a Friday night. I do love that they have an entire menu for gluten free diners. It's so hard to find gluten free in restaurants don't even mention an entire menu! I was impressed! I ended up splitting artichokes with parmesan (ask for no bread crumbs) with my mom and got myself a chicken caesar. Both were decent. We did end up ordering a gluten free chocolate soufflé (make sure to specify that you want it gluten free because they had a normal version as well) which was amazing and I would definitely go there just for that. Overall a good family weeknight restaurant that is that is above average meal. Definitely a place to go if you have celiacs or are gluten intolerant.",0
"This restaurant = a great experience. Everything about this place is fabulous. The server was extremely attentive, the food was fresh and delicious, and the intimate yet casual ambiance is to die for.

ENTREE

For starters, they do put a rather unique spin on the typical 'chips and salsa' that's brought out to you in the beginning of most Spanish restaurants. They bake corn tortillas until their crisp and serve that with an interesting array of dips: black bean, salsa, and a tray of salt, limes, and hot sauce to stir in.

I ordered a simple entree of carne asada tacos and black beans; my meal was yummy and filling, and I even had leftovers. Beware of spicy when choosing your dish, however. My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was (beer battered fish burrito). I don't know if she has sensitive taste buds, or if it was really spicy.. so proceed with caution.

DESSERT

They have a wide variety of entrees, but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options. I'm a BIG dessert person, so it was a little disappointing but what the heck. I ordered the flan and it was scrumptious, incredible, delectable, etc.. all that good stuff. My coworker who complained about the spiciness called our dessert 'sexy'. So I guess sexy is the best way to describe it's caramel drizzle and chocolate bark yumminess.

AMBIANCE/SERVICE

The waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. He answered all questions we had, and gave speedy and praiseworthy service. The manager even came up to our table and made conversation; that, to me, is always a plus. The background music helped add to the overall appeal to the restaurant. 

I would definitely go back to SOL. Maybe tomorrow..",1
Always a marvelous experience. The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting. The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff. The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines. The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here. I have been there for Valentine's Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special. It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.,1
I visit this Subway several times a week. Staff are very friendly. Good customer service. Ingredients seem pretty consistently fresh. It's a standard Subway but differentiated by friendly staff and good service.,1
"I Felt a sin coming on .......
 if i could give 10 stars i would !!!!

Let me set the scene for you of this Kazilicious Sunday night .....

We enter through  a solid planked door set in the rear ...(oh yes the
truth is inside) candlelit passageway leads you into a sexy,sultry
stone interior that is softened by the plush seating , dim lighting
,wine barrels .. i give his hand a squeeze and smile because we have
hit the mother load within this sinfully sexy speakeasy .The Tuscan
colors coupled with the stone ..deep ,rich ,decadent !!! His hand on
the small of my back as we approach our seats as the intimacy and
ambiance takes hold .

A bowl of olives, 3 cheese fondue with apple ,the Tuscany pizza
....sexy damn noshes ..they know what they are doing here ..soft
...firm....dip....bite ..yesssss SO beyond sexy here.....

Oh and the wine ,nectar of the gods, sign of fertility , here in this
setting it is like Ambrosia ,and your inner God or Goddess will surely
blossom ,and romance will bloom ....
It seems like thousands of labels here - we went with the  M.
Chapoutier Le Sizeranne 98' ....Heady ,earthy ,smoky ,deep ,sweet and
ripe .the smell of currants and berries .lovely texture ,full bodied
.....DIVINE ! let the flirting begin ..coy toying of the glass stem
..sweet smiles ..love words escaping on a whisper  between sips.

We spent around $200 ,worth every penny in my opinion .

Prior to the Kaz , the Rokerij was just about the sexiest spot to me
in the valley ...these two must share the crown .

So to recap ; SEXY, SULTRY,SEDUCTIVE !!!!! posh,swank ...
Good Service , lush wine selection ,yummy tidbits ...
Ambiance up the wazoooo .

A heady experience ..this is where lovers go ,a prelude to the
interlude of love !",1
"Delicious, cheap (for how much you actually get), and oh yeah, delicious.

I LOVE this place. I easily take home enough food for 3 meals. Great variety and nice people.",1
"This was the first Thai I have had and it did not disappoint.

I went to Mint Thai with my in-laws, who love the place, so I had high expectations. It's a nice restaurant, with ample seating, and a good atmosphere. The menu can be a little intimidating. Each dish is numbered, named, and has a description, and there are something like 70+ dishes to choose from, plus spiciness options, so it can be kind of hard especially for a newbie.

I picked something in the 60s with chicken and red curry. It was really delicious, with unique flavors and a good spiciness. My only difficulty was that my food was basically swimming in the sauce. I ended up packing some up to take home, and ended up with a plate still full of sauce.

Other than that, this place was delicious. If only it weren't so far away, so I could try more of their options.",1
"I suppose you could just put me in the ""box"" with ""Luis T"" on 3.20.10...because if i didnt know any better, his could have been my entry.. So i was here this week.  Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now, and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage.  I will save the stories from the recent years and why i've been feeling this way, and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are ""No Split Checks"" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?  We had a large party, and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks, yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices, and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.   And by the end of it, we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code.  Ok, im getting ahead of myself..Its one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed, understaffed, there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game, or concert going on...This was not the case.  We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked.  How many times must one flag down the server for (take your pick) A;  refill on chips B: refill on ice water and C:(most importantly since the drinks are marked up 300%) a FRESH DRINK!!! Oh yes and D: Check please.  We had to look over our shoulders for A , B, C, and D.  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that, and then we realized an 18% gratuity was included...well no wonder.  When that is the case, there is NO incentive for decent service!! We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice ""They are complaining about the service"" to an audience that didnt exist.  Damn right! and damn right we will take our business elsewhere.  Grandma Chavez is rolling in her grave! you should be ashamed!",0
"The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all.  I even emailed them afterwards to give feedback, in hopes that they would redeem themselves by showing some good service that way.  No luck.  Didn't even get a response.

They will not be getting any more of my business.  Too bad because I'd actually had a decent mushroom burger there before and would have been a regular customer.  But the service last time was so bad that I won't go back.",0
"3 friends and I went for restaurant week.  Iruna has great ambiance and charm.  The service was top-notch, and our server made excellent wine recommendations.  The desserts were amazing.  The other food was just ok.  

Here's what we had:

tapas - tortilla espanola (which was complimentary) was delicious; chistorra (chorizo in cider w/ baby artichokes) was also good; pan con tomate was surprising because it didn't seem to be tapas.  rather it was huge chunks of grilled bread that didn't work well to distribute flavors and was oily.

entrees - trout with salsa navarra, eggplant, roasted peppers, onion and tomato was very nicely cooked and had a nice balance of flavors.  filet mignon with tomatoes and salbitxada was order medium rare but delivered very well done and over-salted.  It was refired, and v2 was the right temperature but still over-salted.  

we glanced at the patio on the way out which looks fantastic.  We return to try some other tapas and sangria on their outdoor couches.",0
"This restaurant is incredible, and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu I've had in my life. All the food is wonderful, though. The calamari is not fried. The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven, and the tomatoes are the freshest I've tasted outside of my mom's own garden. This is great attention to detail.

I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted. This is the first place I want take out-of-town visitors I'm looking to impress.

The owner, Jon, is helpful, friendly, and really cares about providing a positive dining experience. He's spot on with his wine recommendations, and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page.",1
"Update: As of Feb 2010 this place closed because the owners got in a bitch fight.

I live right next door to this place at Shade.  I go often enough, great happy hour.  Prices are pretty cheap ($5ish for the various happy hour sushi rolls), service is pretty fast, and it's great that it's locally owned and not a chain restaurant.  

Only ""negative"" comment is it' is a bit small inside, hard to accommodate large groups of more than 8, and even that is pushing it if they are busy.  If you can go before everyone gets off work, it's pretty quiet in there, and fun to sit at the sushi bar as well.",1
Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...,0
"Definitely one of the better Thai options in the Valley.  This place is small and pretty casual - but they do have nice touches like carved wood decor inside.  Got a green papaya salad with grilled prawns and a chicken satay.  The satay was perfect.  The salad was also tasty.  The Thai tea was the ideal accompaniment.  And afterward I could not resist the sticky rice with mango - which was fantastic.  Prices were reasonable, too.  I'll for sure be back.  The location is quite convenient, including a huge parking lot.",1
"If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you, this is the school for you. Education is horrible. If you are a democrat, don't speak your mind; you will be considered a reject from day one. I got 100% on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields. This institution is a joke.",0
"Chino is a cool place to take someone who has never been there before.  It's strange and fascinating.  I live fairly close by and the food is fine, but it certainly doesn't blow your mind.  It's the kind of place that I get that Chino craving then I don't need to go for another 6 months or a year.  The snickerdoodles are great and come with the meal.  Expect to pay close to $10 a person if you get a drink with your meal.",0
"A great experience every time we make it here.  Where else can you slide into the dining room?  We always have large groups and they are very accomodating, every table we've been at affords a beautiful view at sunset.  They try to make it a complete experience.
Servers are always very helpful and attentive.  Steaks are good and the sides are good if not very inventive.   The birthday dessert and cotton candy really cap off the dinners.",1
"Had a late night plumbing emergency last night. Called a friend who recommended Kevin's Classic Plumbing. Within an hour the plumber was at my home repairing my problem. At 10:00pm my water was back on with kids taking showers, toilets being flushed, and my wife was talking to me again. Sounds great right? Get's even better! The price they charged me for the after hours repair was the most reasonable ever. Last but not least he was a heck of a nice guy. Kevin's Classic Plumbing will be my plumbing company for both home and work from now on.

On another note... I had called one of those companys that advertise on TV all day long. They were not able to come out last night and when they did call me they indicated that it was probably not something they could fix and would most likely require a two man crew. Thanks Parker & Son's.",1
"Food--The fire roasted garlic tomato soup is excellent.  They sprinkle tortilla chips for garnish over a tiny dollop of sour cream.  Mmmmm.  Yummy.  The mixed green salad with albacore tuna is also a delightful choice, as is the turkey wrap and CA Chicken sandwich with pesto mayo.  Drip coffee and espresso drinks are good, too.  Overall, everything tastes great because it's made fresh.  No pre-packaged items here.

Seating--Lots of booths and tables inside and out.  They have a cozy little set up with what looks to be 'lounge' chairs that accommodates 6 with swivel tables perfect, for savoring your beverage of choice.  The rest of the dining area looks like it has capacity for about 100 people, if all seats were filled despite a placard declaring the maximum capacity is '311'.

Peak times--avoid lunchtime during the weekdays.  It would appear that all of Surprise is feenin for a sandwich or soup/salad special from PB during 11-1PM.  The lines are long and you can forget about getting back to work in under an hour if you factor in commute time, food prep & consumption.  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.  The only time service has been 'fast' is during breakfast.  I've been there for a breakfast networking event and on a Saturday.  During these times, I received my order promptly and had little trouble locating a table.

Free stuff--this would include WiFi, bread samples with tasty spreads, muffin and/or cookie bits.  Bonus points for free stuff!

PB is open Mon-Sat 7AM-9PM and Sun 7AM-6PM.",1
"Awesome! I highly recommend this place! Incredible atmosphere inside and out, the bar design is superb and the patio is the perfect spot for relaxing and enjoying drinks with friends. I went for the second time recently and have to give this place a stellar review. The menu is innovative and fresh! The mixed drinks are killer and the wine on tap was an extremely pleasant surprise. Plus, you can't beat their happy hour seven days a week! 

 I have had the crab cake BLT and the halibut sandwich, which were both out of this world! Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and I can't wait to go back and try all the others.  The servers were great and knowledgeable about their menu which is always a big plus! As a parent, I love that this place is a perfect day/night out spot for a date or hanging with friends but also a family oriented neighborhood joint where I can bring my kiddo along! Love that Churn is right next door to get some yummy dessert after an incredible meal!  The design is spot on for this area! Great job!",1
"This restaurant is close to my office, so it is a regular stop for either a great Mexican breakfast or lunch. Never been dissapointed, nor have any of my co workers. Try the Huevos Rancheros or the Chiliquiles ( With the Green Sauce ), it is a favorite.",1
"My sis recommend this place for our weekly dinner. We shared on of the large appetizer platters (hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli and dolmades and two pitas). Very good and perfect for a light dinner. I would have to say the best thing was the fresh lemonade...wow! If you like tart you'll love this. 

I thought overall the service was great. Not only was our waitress extremely attentive but the manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our food

I give The Flaming Kabob 3 stars!",0
"i miss this place so much, it's insanity. 

ten high kentucky bourbon is all i can say.. and i never really cared how bad i felt the next day.",1
"¡CASH ONLY! But so worth it.

I have been  a regular at this place for the past 10 years. I am Mexican and for me this is the most authentic ""Cenaduría"" in Phoenix. 

The food is authentic. They use the white Mexican cheese is used in Mexico. In Mexico cheddar cheese is not used on top of tacos or tostadas. Prices are very affordable. The ladies that take your order at the front desk had been there for at least 10 years and are very kind. 

Restrooms are always clean and this is so important to me. If a restaurant does not have the time to maintain its restrooms clean then I can not trust them in the food being clean.

The cons......BRING CASH! no credit cards are accepted. Also, they do not have the best control over flies. I always have a fly somewhere around my table. I think it has to be with no AC. They have some kind of cooler and fans. And they can have the Tv and the jukebox playing at the same time which is annoying. 

The good news is that you can always take the food out.

¡Excellent food!",1
"Sorry Jesse had such a bad experience here.  I have been using this place for about, well,  from the week they opened as it is so close to my office.

They have never lost or damaged any of my clothing, and I drop my wife's delicate stuff off here as well for dry cleaning.  They have also always been true to their word on when I can pick up my clothes - although I am usually days late on the pick-up (one benefit of being a clothes-horse I guess). 

Two doors down from Dunkin, so fantastic to drop and pick the rags and then grab a cup o'joe before hitting the office.  The women who work there aren't too hard on the eyes, either, which is always a plus.

Hard to believe they are still using a dot matrix printer, but that has no impact on service.",1
Anyone who tells you this place isn't amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isn't anything on the menu that isn't good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasn't stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well.,1
"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but.. well.. let me explain. 


I came in on a Friday around 5:15pm trying to catch an early dinner. I am glad I did as upon entering I noticed they close close @ 7:30pm. When I came in all the tables were empty but they all had ""reserved"" place cards on them. Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy. 

The restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise. 

The food is best described as ""home cooking"". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland? 

Overall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself. As for me I did like the restaurant and their owners but I think I will only return for the soup in the future, which I would gladly give 5 stars.",1
"I had dinner here tonight, and loved the entire experience! The patio was roomy, our server was quick, and the food was delicious! I ordered the Thai Cobb salad and really enjoyed the unique, healthy flavor! My dinner was priced fairly and I got a lot of food. I will be going back",1
"It's like being a Target girl but recognizing the value and prices of Walmart... so I don't make a point to shop here (vs LeeLee's with greater intl variety), but when I am in the area... I frantically think of what is low in the pantry so supplies can be restocked at a minor savings.  The pricing is marginally cheaper -- to clarify, the auto 10% discount is calc off the non-sale items.",0
"The person before me reviewed Phoenix Greyhound Park as a Flea Market. I....will be reviewing the Greyhound Park in Dog Race form. 

We came here during 4th of July night, after many drinks and BBQ-ing and swimming at my relatives home. Prior to leaving to come here, it sounded like a good idea - I was comparing the dog races to the Del Mar horse races in San Diego in my head.

But, during the drive, I started feeling wary. This is Arizona, and they're racing dogs in 110 degree heat? What is the constant tugging at my heartstrings? This guilt isn't working for me. 

The track is outdoor, while the patrons betting on these beautiful animals sit indoor in stadium seating, behind huge glass windows, watching giddily while drinking beer and eating snack bar-type foods. Admission is free. 

They do keep the dogs indoor before racing them. I decided I'd relent and bet on a race, then immediately felt like an asshole when they brought the dogs around for the camera and I saw them dressed in numbered garb and muzzles. I lost, but I didn't bet for the rest of the races we stayed for, it just didn't feel right.

Everyone else had a good time, though, especially the winners. 

How can I get so excited about the horse races but not the dog races? I'm a walking contradiction.",0
"The Valley Beer Drinkers Meetup Group has been coming here for months - since before the name change - on occasional Wednesdays for $3 craft pints & the fantastic wings special. We've always had a good experience, and the extensive, rotating brew selection keeps the venue fresh.

I've been urging the owner to add at least ONE Pilsner to the IPA-heavy menu, and last night he delivered with a quintessential model: Munchener Spaten Pils! It was great.

Adding to the experience was the excellent food. Portions were generous and satisfying!. One member ordered the Fish & Onion Rings, and when it arrived, two others immediately ordered their own! I can't remember better fish (pollack here) or more perfect onion rings! Homemade potato chips were remarkable, and the fry cook definitely knows the craft! Diners have many options for sides w/ entrees, which is a generous touch. Only the cole slaw was a bit bland. 

Service was friendly & generally good, but not attentive enough later in the meal. Thanks for separate checks, too.

I really look forward to returning for brews and to further explore the enticing menu!",1
"Wow! I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals. Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip. As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home. Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach.  Usually I'm pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.  Simple, fresh, delicious...

Just remember to bring cash",1
"I really wanted to like this place. I'm Greek and my family cooks a lot of Greek food.  Their tzatziki sauce was runny and not flavorful. Everything was just real commercialized, nothing tasted right or even close to homemade.",0
"The food here is amazing! So full of flavor, not fat. Healthy, and delicious!  Prices in the 10 range for a salad, and 20 range for an entree'.  The resturant is very loud, because they are always busy. The chairs are too small for my hips, making it uncomfortable to stay very long.  Oh well. I suppose they expect, if you eat here, you must be a size 6.",1
"I judge a soul food place by its fried chicken, a donut shop by its old fashioned, an ice cream place by its vanilla, and a Greek place by it's gyros.  The gyros here are bland and wholly unspectacular - and sourced from the same frozen food purveyor (Sysco?) as every other gyro stop in Phoenix.  The cloyingly thick pita didn't help either.

I don't know why it is so challenging to find a legitimate rotating spit gyro in this town - but it is.  Especially near downtown Phoenix.

Recommendations welcome.",0
"My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Every time we drive by he wants to go in and eat. Even if we are driving home from a dinner we just had!! 

1. The people that work there are AMAZING. They are so nice and hospitable, always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want. (romantic date, take out, quick bar eats, etc.) 

2. This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix. I don't know how they find half of the stuff the serve, but they do, and it is just off the boat. (I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave, like Kumomato Oysters, all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms) 

3. Pricing is right on...since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure, I am always amazed at the value they present. 


Keep Rocking Yasu!!!",1
"ok so here's what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.  Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.  Wow.",0
"Had lunch here a couple of days ago.  

Place was dead.  Only one other table had people at it.  Service was quick.  Reuben sandwich I ordered was delivered promptly.  Meat was tasty but not exactly plentiful (I'm used to a New York style Reuben - with loads of meat).  Potato salad that came with the sandwich was very good, a pleasant surprise.  

Outdoor seating was nice, though the birds did get tiresome.  Place seemed clean.  Plenty of seats.  Upstairs deck area would be great in the evening.  Seems like it would be a much more fun place with a group of people for happy hour  or dinner than it was for lunch.  

Bottom line - it was okay.  Not bad, not great.  I'd give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.",0
"I have seen this place for years and years but had never gone in until one night awhile ago.  It turned out to be a really cool bar with live music and great drink specials.

It's a small place, but what it lacks in size, it makes up in character.  It has a vibe all its own and if you get there early, you can sit right up front and check out the band. 

Do something different and go to Char's, you'll be glad you did.",1
"As a former Bay Area resident, I have come to love and appreicate all asian food. Generally, I prefer Japanese and Thai over Chinese, however, when it comes to Iron Chef it's my favorite.  The location is perfect as it's only a quick two or three minute drive from my house.  Their food is absolutely delcious and is on par with a high end chinese restaurant.  The quality of the meat, fish and vegetables is just excellent and it's always very consistent.  I generally order the garlic chicken as I love spicy food!  It's a wonderful mix of vegetables and white meat and the sauce is perfect, full of flavor and not at all greasy.  I also like the fact that they offer brown rice as an option and their eggrolls are some of the best I've tasted.  

The family meal for $29.95 is an excellent value and is enough food for four or five people.   We ordered it for the two of us and had leftovers for a week!  It includes sweet/sour pork, broccoli beef, orange chicken, chow mein, fried rice, steamed rice, soup and eggrolls.  

I sure hope that Iron Chef survives the recession.  I try to eat there as often as I can :)",1
"Decentfood, but horrible service. Both servers walked by me three times while I was sitting inside without acknowledging me at all. I was by myself and felt as though everyone else that came walking in were immediately welcomed.  I wish I would have received the same attention. I was ready to walk out when i was finally approached. Nobody came back to check on me to make sure everything was ok after they delivered my food. Being from Vegas I am not accustomed to such non attentive service staff. I guess that flys here in Scottsdale, but I expected more from the type of clientele that they have. On a positive note, they do have a cozy place that gives the feel of a French coffee shop/bistro. Hopefully this review will be helpfull in giving them insight into making sure that every guest is treated with the same attentiveness to service.",0
"Would have to agree with Rana A below... I think she said it best

Actually, I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations...

Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night. OK, I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say ""you mean the one in Scottsdale"" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back...",0
"My family and I decided to try CD last Saturday night and it was great!  We started with the homemade potato chips and Smoked Salmon which were both EXCELLENT and moved on to the pork ribs, salmon, gnocchi and a burger.  My family and I have a tradition to share the first bite with each other and wow... they have a winner here.  I am not a huge fan of some of the other Fox restaurants, but this is a winning combo.  Great price/value and the service was spot on.   Can't wait to go back this weekend!",1
"Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners...",0
"Solid. We hit up the happy hour which features 50% off booze and tacos for $1.50. I had the duck, shrimp, and cochinita pibil (pork). They were tinier than most street-style tacos I've had (and boy howdy, have I eaten a lot of those from Cali to NY) and  even a little soggy. The duck was my least favorite as it had a rubbery taste and texture. The shrimp was A-OK but for my money, the cochinita was really where it's at with his super-porkey deliciousness. We also split the queso fundido (rich with cream cheesey chunks, whaaaat???). It was way tasty but it could probably double for spackle in a pinch. The most successful item of the night was the churros with goat cheese caramel. Between my 3 buddies and myself, we made quick work of that dish. Each of us had their house margarita which was strong (just like I like it), but I'm not entirely sure I'd order that drink for non-happy hour prices. One of the big drawbacks, however, was that our server was really rushed and we had a hard time getting his attention. 

On the whole, I think I'd be back to try some other items. The chicken mole torta looked really appealing. Be forewarned though, it IS a spendy joint. Expect to pay $15 - $20 for most entrees. On a post-grad shoestring budget, it is certainly a splurge. We did love the mural outback and the groovy art inside.",0
"Ok, so we've been here  a total of two times... the first was a pretty good experience... not memorable, but ok. Then we went again, last night for Mothers Day. My Dad wanted the Trout so bad, so us Mothers gave in. The only positive thing to say about them is how nice they were, we called to see if we could get in at for dinner at 8:30pm, (they closed at 9pm) they said not a problem. I was kinda impressed cuz we've called other restaraunts and they have turned us down in the same senario.... when we sat down, we ordered right away, it took awhile for us to get our food, i finally had to flag our waitress down and ask her to bring whatever was ready whenever it was ready. My salad was probably the best thing I had that night next to the water. Come on tho, how hard is it to mess up salad and a water! My Dad had the trout, he finished it but said it wasnt the best, my Mom had the Chicken Parmesean. She picked around the stuff she didn't like. I ordered a coconut shrimp apetizer, it arrived cold. The bill for two adult entrees and one appetizer a small ceaser salad and one childs meal was $80....  we still tipped $20, but $100 for one of the worst meals in a long time wasn't worth it. We won't be back at least for awhile.",0
"I did not expect such a great find in a such a nondescript location. I went there looking for a very odd beer. Not only did they have it, they had tons of it. The guy behind the counter was helpful as soon as I walked in, and showed me exactly what I needed.

They know what they sell very well, and can give excellent recommendations on whatever you might be looking for. It was great to talk shop with someone who obviously knew his stuff.",1
"Obs, a great location in the quaint Gold Spot next to the soon-to-be Pita Jungle. I really like what they did with the space. The vintage elementary school chairs bring me back to the days of learning cursive and pasting cotton balls on paper to create a snowman. Lots of natural light, too! The coffee is spot on, and they have pastries as well. -1 star for not having a punch card. They need to get on that!",1
"I liked this place. The reviews show low stars but I liked it. I was there for happy hour so go at that time. The pricing is good. I don't know about dinner, but happy hour is cool.  Servers were chill.  Host was a bit stuck up. Not sure why she though she was that great. But the place is cool. I recommend people check it out if they want to try a sushi place on the Mill ave when you are in town visiting Tempe.",1
"I have stayed at the Firesky on a few different occasions.  I love the place.  Granted, there are nicer, more luxurious places to stay in the area, but for the price, you can't beat it.  The pool area and bar are fantastic, the staff is super friendly (which seems to be the case all over AZ), and the lobby is very cool with its ostrich skin couches.",1
"After moving here a few months ago the search has been on to find a decent sushi place in Phoenix, after all, it's Phoenix.  I don't set my expectation too high because I know how difficult it can be to get fresh sushi here.  
I enjoyed Moira because their creations are simple and they don't drown the sushi in sauce like some other American sushi joints.  Sushi is about the rice and the fish.  Both were pretty good here.  The salmon and the white tuna nigiri were fresh tasting and soft and the rice was great as well.  The kamikaze roll was also delicious, but maybe could have used a little more spice.
They have the best miso soup I have had since living in Japan.  Very tasty, not watered down or flavorless like most other places.
The drinks creations are fun and tasty, I went for the favorite karma.  I like my drinks like a like my women, spicy, sweet, and filled with booze.  Our waitress said she would even be open for a new creation if we gave her some ideas.
The service was great and friendly.  We were there on a Friday, but surprised it wasn't loud and bustling.  I can see how it could be at times as it is a little small.  Fun and modern decor, clean place!",1
"I like these sort of ""mom & pop"" spots, small and intimate setting.  Great pizza!  I always enjoy the veggie pizza with jalapenos, oh so good!  And mu hubby loves the suicide wings, but we've tried almost everything off of the menu and you CANNOT go wrong.  Prices rock too!",1
"Five of us enjoyed a casual and wonderful dinner at Blue Adobe. The fresh chips and dark salsa were very good - it took a lot of willpower to stop munching the chips and salsa before our meals arrived. I ordered the chicken chorizo which was accompanied by twice-baked potatoes served in a jalapeno pepper half - unique and zesty - as well as grilled vegetable strips.  All five of us truly enjoyed our meals. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual. Our server, Ashley, was excellent. I would definitely recommend Blue Adobe if you are in the Scottsdale area.",1
I was at Liberty Market this morning for breakfast. The grilled bread pudding is amazing. And the bathrooms are so adorable!,1
"OK, so I haven't been to a buffet in a long time.  When I reflect on the idea of buffets -- Sweet Tomatoes excluded, since lots of salad means lots of Good-For-You-ness, right?... --  I feel like I used up my lifetime maximum instances of buffet-eating in college, where the dining halls were all-you-can eat.  Anyway, this place just opened and is within walking distance of where I live, so my neighbors and I decided to check it out.  

Overall I wasn't very impressed with the food, even in comparison to other Chinese food buffets I've been to in the past.  In addition to a standard selection of Chinese buffet items (beef with broccoli, fried rice, sweet and sour chicken) they have sushi, pizza (for kids, I'm assuming), and a hibachi grill section where you can pick vegetables and meats and they'll stir fry it for you (included in the buffet price).  The hibachi stir fry I made up was OK, but the sauce added to it was too salty for me.  The sushi was bland and what you would expect from a grocery store.  They only had regular high-sodium soy sauce, as far as I could tell.  (I tried asking one of the wait staff for low-sodium soy sauce and there was a language barrier; he brought back another staff member to our table, who also didn't understand what I was asking.)  The egg roll I tried was really salty (even without sauce) and nothing to write home about.  Usually sweet & sour sauce can make even mediocre egg rolls worth eating, but the S&S sauce on the buffet was a downright-scary Kool-Aid-red color.  However, the fresh pineapple and melon was a nice touch, as were the 8 different ice cream flavors on the far end of the line.

I will say it was pretty cheap at $10 per adult, so if you're looking for a lot of food on a budget, it might be a decent option for you.  Personally though, I just think I am past the days of eating foods with scary salt levels, artificial colors, etc., so I won't plan on going back (though if I had to return for some reason, there are enough edible options so that I wouldn't starve).",0
"I am a big fan of both the Vig and the Uptown Vig, but I like the Uptown Vig only because there is never any wait for a table.  Though I am sure the Uptown would prefer some wait because that would mean more people, more money, etc.

Back to the Uptown: great trendy layout with a sweet indoor patio that gives the illusion of being outside without the sweltering heat or desert night cold.  The menu is eclectic drawing inspiration from Thai, Indian, American and Mexican cuisines.  My favorite are the Nachos.  They are ginormous and packed with every ingredient you might ever want topping chips.  The sweet potato fries are also delightful.

They have a few specials, which elude me now, but I remember one involves 20 bucks for wine and an appetizer.  Also they have Hoegaarden on tap which is a plus.",1
"I'ld give 6 stars if possible for each and every appetizer we have had. The tomato soup, caesar salad, beignets, and crab dip are all way more delicious than they have any right to be. However, the stand out is clearly the shrimp canapé - one of the best  appetizers I've ever had. Period. 

The other side of the coin is the at-best mediocre entrees. The first night we had a gift certificate and ordered an absurd amount of food and ended up leaving both the burger and meatloaf largely untouched. On subsequent visits the appetizers were consistently amazing and the variety of entrees just didn't live up to the apps. The blackened tacos were bland and tasteless. The meatloaf was swimming in liquid. The burger bun was overly toothsome and the burger bland. 

Long story short - order appetizers (which there are more than enough of) and you will be happy. Also happy hour is great but the wine is overpriced otherwise. 

Take away = worth it for shrimp canapé if nothing else!",1
"Surprisingly authentic Sichuan cuisine in Phoenix. The staff were very friendly and accommodated our infant without any problem. The mapo doufu had great spice to it. The garlic eggplant (yuxiang qiezi) had excellent flavor and we also highly recommend the twice cooked pork (hui guo rou) and fried green beans (ganbian sijidou). The prices are certainly reasonable for the size and quality of the food. The open kitchen is also a nice touch as it gives kids something fun to stare at (flames shoot up from the dishes being cooked every few minutes). Admittedly, we only went because out POS airline put us up at the residence inn across the street after we missed a connecting flight, however, if we go back to Phoenix or if we lived in Phoenix, we'd definitely go to Szechwan Palace again.",1
"I don't know if it's in Phoenix or Scottsdale (referencing previous posts), but all the Phoenician's literature has their address as Scottsdale. 
   Anyway, it's easy to nitpick, but when they charge the prices they do, excellence should prevail.  The setting is lovely, rooms are sumptuous (one year we did get one that was pretty rickety and needed a do-over,however), staff is very friendly and generally accomodating.  BUT, we usually arrive about noon and I end up sitting in the lobby until the room is available.  This time it was available at 3:35 PM.  I'm glad we called the day before and asked for it to be expedited since we're Starwood members and have stayed there several times before and would be arriving early.  I know they have a noon checkout, but, cmon, three and a half hours to clean a room?!  They guarantee the room will be ready at 4 so I guess I should count my blessings that I got in 25 min. early.  Food in the restaurants is always good, as it should be, again, for the prices they charge.  I cringe at a fruit cup with yogurt for $9.00.   The Center for Well-Being, their spa/exercise area is very nice.  Friends and I took advantage of some of the classes such as water exercise in the pool, belly dancing, pilates, etc.   Instructors all knew their stuff and were fun and friendly.
  I am always amused by the fact that you can stay at a cheap motel off any superhighway and get free wifi, coffee in the room and often free breakfast.  At The Phoenician there's no coffee pot in the room ($4. a cup downstairs), extra charge for internet access, etc. 
  It's a lovely place but could, and should, be so much more.",1
"Wanted Thai food near Chandler tonight but realized few are open on Sundays. Here's how the morning's research played out:

1. Great reviews for Thai Rama on Yelp but no hours of operation. Strike one.
2. Look for hours on restaurant's web site. Strike two. 
3. Call restaurant. No voicemail greeting after 34 rings. Strike three looking.
4. Discover Facebook page, which despite having just 85 fans does include hours of operation, as well as some nice feedback from patrons.
5. Will try Thai Rama tonight with unfairly high expectations. Hope the food is worth all the effort it took to get the most basic information.",0
"A friend of mine in Ahwatukee is very annoyed that I've become snobby about moving downtown (I deny this, for the record) and never go out anymore in Tukee where we were once neighbors. Tanked Fish to the rescue! I will now drive the irritating 15+ miles out of my way to eat here on a weeknight, whenever he can break free from his wife and two cute little kids (he wouldn't approve of the way I word that, for the record). 

I'm concerned that the high ratings this place has gotten so far will lead to false expectations. I love Tanked Fish for two very simple reasons: I always have a great time, and I always stuff my face with sushi until I can eat no more. One night we came here, ate more sushi than we needed to, had a large beer or two, and the bill for all of this... two of us... came to TWENTY SIX DOLLARS. I'm sorry folks but there are very few places on earth where this is possible. [Note: This was during a weeknight happy hour special]

A snooty sushi connaisseur would probably tell you that something is wrong with the quality of the sushi. I can't. It tastes good. It has some large tables and would be a great place to bring a large group (6-8 people). As for the vibe of the place, although it has some nice trendy decor it's still more of a neighborhood bar than a destination unto itself, I would say. So don't walk into here expecting Ahwatukee's answer to Nobu (and then whine about it on Yelp and complain that Phoenix is not as cool as, say, Chicago). If your needs are very simple, and they are to stuff your face with sushi and have a good time shootin' the breeze with your buds, Tanked Fish will meet them.",1
"I know my 2 girlfriends that absolutely LOVE this place will balk at my 4 stars instead of 5. But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating. 

We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a ""valet"" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. 

Sadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. 

We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). 

For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. 

And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). 

And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)",1
"We were craving Mexican food and since we were in the area I decided to check on my trusty yelp app on my phone to find a perfect food joint to check out.  Sure enough, it came through for us and told us about this little gem tucked away in an area I had been several times but had never noticed it before.  I am so very glad I tried it as it will now be my go-to place for Mexican food.  The food is delicious and fresh and reasonably priced.  The guacamole is a must try and the carne asada is so good.  If you're in the mood for Mexican and in the area, I would definitely recommend this place.",1
"This dairy sells fresh milk, straight from the cow.  That's what they're licensed to sell.  They use organic feed (dried grasses), hydrogen peroxide for cleaning certain things, and iodine to clean the cows' teats (just like many dairies used to).  They want the cows to be out on pasture, but they need a bigger piece of land to do so.  If you know of a piece of land in the area, please suggest it to Jackie Calamos.  I love their milk.  As of this date, milk is $10/gallon, the true cost of the milk (or maybe even a little low).  Most of the milk you buy in the store isn't worth the price.  Forcing more production out of cows with hormones comes at the cost of quality (and your health).  SYD's has all the good stuff (the proof is in the taste).  It's never made us sick, and we've been drinking it for 2 years.  It's a miracle that this metro area actually has a dairy willing to sell fresh milk to the public!  Thank you, Save Your Dairy!",1
"How can you not love Westgate??? They really do have it all for everyone!!! 

Plenty of places to get a bite to eat. A few places you can enjoy are Southwest Moes, Margarita, Johnny Rockets, Ocean Blue, Cold Stone, a new pizza place that slips my mind, and so much more. If you want BBQ, frozen yogurt, burgers, steak, or what ever else makes you say yum...they have it! 

If you have the itch to shop, they can satisfy your every need! I always pop in to Just Sports to see what they have for my favorite Valley team...Go Coyotes!!! 

Speaking of entertainment! They have it all... a huge AMC movie complex, first class Jobbing.com Arena (Phoenix Coyotes NHL hockey, concerts, and more), UPS right next door for Cards football, and conventions. Plenty of thirst quenching bars, and one certain days of the week, live music in the splash pad area in front of AMC. 

As if you need more...WG is clean, safe, easy to get to from any place in the Valley, and plenty of free parking! I am not the only one who loves this place. Every time my family gets visitors from New York come in, WG is always a must stop!",1
"It's a restaurant in a gas station, but it merits five stars b/c it has glass bottles of soda, just like you find in Mexico.  Good food too.  It's actually not nearly as bad inside as you'd think, it's pretty well set apart from the gas station sales, so I wouldn't mind eating there.  They have a few tables set up inside.  I usually get takeout though (they also deliver).  

MANZANA LIFT ROCKS!!!  I'm also going to be drinking the Sprite in the bottle, (cane sugar ftw) and the horchata.  I don't care about Chipotle opening near work anymore, I've found a new Mexican fix for lunch.  What a happy day.",1
"I saw the review below and just thought it was ridiculous. RIDICULOUS. 

Elderly people work here or volunteer. You expect customer service that you'd receive at a high-end store. No. People die and their things that are usually in good condition are donated and are resold at really cheap prices. No, the people there will not be making sure you're finding everything okay, you're on your own... and that's how it should be when you're thrifting.

I usually find great things. Glasswares, books, shoes, purses. They have amazing furniture that is so cheap. They have many half off days and various sales throughout the week.

Just make sure you go on a weekday or Saturday and before 2pm.. all the stores in this plaza close at 4 and are closed Sundays.",1
"I've been to Buffalo Wild Wings before, but my first visit at this location was during UFC 117.

If you come here to watch fighting events like UFC I would recommend arriving 2 hours before the main card starts if you want a seat inside. I arrived an hour before the PPV portion of the fight started and didn't get a seat until half an hour in and it was outside. I ordered 12 regular wings and I was very underwhelmed. I felt the wings were overpriced because they are smaller than average.

The main reason why I went here was that they weren't charging a cover or bill minimum for the fight. Also, the atmosphere for a UFC fight was really good compared to the other BWW I went to in Tucson.

If you want a place with a good atmosphere for a sporting event, you should come to BWW. But your food expectations should be lowered a lot.",0
"One of the best craft brew retailers in the NW valley.  While the Camelback store has an even more impressive selection as well as seasonal sells on certain items, this location also has a pretty solid catalog on hand.  I've noticed how the craft brew selection has expanded over the years.  I used to be one of the only guys in the aisle and now I have to pull rank and push guys out of the way who are day dreaming for too long.  

I would love to open my own chain and only sell craft brew.  I'd name it Total Craft and Nothing more.",1
"This is the best restaurant chain EVER!!!!  I love EVERYTHING there and the service has always been A+.  The fried zucchini strips (appetizer) are the best in the world, the Caesar salad is the best I ever had, even their croutons on the salad are better than any!!!  Olive oil herb dip is Fabulous, the warm bread is like no other.  Most of the dinners that I have tried have been excellent but the Chicken Bryan is magnificent.  Waiters and manager the best.",1
"I've been here four or five times and never been too impressed. The atmosphere, art installations and eclectic seating gave me high hopes. The location is also unbeatable, walking distance from my place. But the service has always been sub-par, like it's a bother to take my order and converse with me.  Everyone here, including most of the clientele, seem way too cool for school.  The iced tea, my usual, is good; the iced coffee is great-tons of flavor and plenty of body. Espresso drinks are pretty standard for your indie coffee shop. I've asked for their vegan pastry (which changes daily) three times only to be told that they ran out for the day. I know that this happens, and I love that they freshly bake their goodies everyday and have a rotating menu, but I would also like to try the vegan scone sometime please.

Today, I ordered a strawberry-raspberry-cranberry smoothie ($5 for a small!) and confirmed with the boy behind the counter that the smoothies are vegan/non-dairy. He said yes then informed me that they use Naked juices for the base then just add fruit and ice. (Naked juice! So that's where the $5 price tag comes from!) Three minutes later, I was handed a delicious looking smoothie topped with...whipped cream...?

Really?!",0
Great food at a great price. Not the best Italian food but definitely a step up from all of the national chains. Also great lunch prices,1
"This joins my long list of places that I really want to love, but ...

I love the atmosphere. I love what they SAY they stand for. I love the concept of two hippies dropping out and dropping back in as restaurateurs.

What I don't love is the food. The chicken and fish tacos I had were bland. No flavoriing. Thank god they had hot sauce (not homemade, store bought) on the table to spice things up a bit.

On a positive note, the prives were good and the salsa they serve with store-bought chips wasn't bad. And the lemonade (they were out of most flavors both times I visited) was good. 

But overall, maybe it's time for the hippies to clean up their act. Worry about the food a little more than the message.",0
"Meh.
Maybe it was just that we decided to dine in 10 minutes prior to closing, but I was definitely not impressed. I had not been here in ages. Probably 10 years, maybe 15. No exaggeration. I remember nothing but good things about Miracle Mile. I remember being excited to come eat here. 
So one night while shopping at Arrowhead with a friend, I got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Thousand Island dressing. I was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu! I didn't have to special order it!
It was a good size sandwich.  Big enough that when cut in half, you still have to use both hands. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. Not that it was bad. It's just that I had fond memories of this place and I was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the #19 at Langer's in Downtown L.A.....or at the least Like Gandolfo's in Tempe. Nope. It was nowhere near as good as either restaurant.  It was just okay. The bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread. The meat was chewy and lacking flavor. The coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch. The flavor of the coleslaw was not strong, but still masked the flavor of the pastrami. I will stick with Jason's or Heidi's next time I have a hankerin' for another deli style sandwich.",0
"4 1/2 stars - really great place!  The decor is nice with cool artwork and beautiful flowers on every table, the service is friendly and food is authentic and delicious!  There happy hour specials are pretty good as well!",1
"We have one of the 1st ones to open in the valley right near us and it's OK.  Sure it has a selection of ready to eat or grocery selections, but watch the pricing.. you (somewhat understandably) pay for the convience and the ""time savings"" of their ready to go's.  I do like their concept and do shop there occasionally (more like if i just need something quick).

Their hotdog buns are sorta sweet which is different, not different bad, just different!

As for the Hybrid only parking... I don't think so...  what a joke!  :)",0
I was very impressed with the service and food. St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work.,1
"This place is gem behind the Central Phoenix library and next to Walgreens. They have great lunch specials that are worth a visit. My favorite dish so far is the spicy noodles. The noodles were flavorful and pretty darn spicy, just how they should be. If you're in the mood for some authentic Thai food, you gotta give this place a try.",1
"Beatiful setting and good service. However, that doesn't make up for the $14 burger which was average at best and all three of ours were over cooked.",0
"Awesome food anyone??? Go check out Modern Steak in Scottsdale, AZ.
Gorgeous dining room! Excellent service (with our server Gabe)! And the food was AAAMMMAZZING!

It's located at Fashion Mall, but it's NOT a ""mall"" restaurant. A MUST go!",1
"I have been graciously reminded by many people that a ""bruin"" is a kind of bear.

Sorry guys... I'm an AZ native (we don't have bears here in Phoenix) with the classic AZ school system education. :)",0
"Someone already commented on the large Cow mural, I was not going to because it might just be me, but I have heard a few comments about it now. Yea, really odd choice, and kind of uncomfortable to be eating a burger and having Elsa the Cow, with very sad eyes, staring at you while your biting into one of her relatives. Other then that, I feel that they did a good job on the decor. Really nice in fact. 
Now I ordered the Zin Burger, and it was very good. I mean as I was eating it, it was as good as any burger that I have had. As good as Gallo Blanco, and Hula's. Very juicy, flavorful, I liked the bun. It was a 5 star until I stopped eating it. Yep, then it lost a star. How? After I was done, my mouth turned into the Salton Sea. Holy crap, easy on the sodium chef!!! Way too much salt. Now I know what salt does, but overkill. I actually tasted salt for the next hour.  You had me with everything else, just don' t want to feel that I just sucked on a pretzel. 

Only other complaint is the pricing. Like everyone else on here, I think the pricing is all wrong. Especially if your going solo. I mean as a single diner I have to order a basket of fries? I thought Delux was stupid for doing so, why make the same bad move. I also saw most people sharing a burger. If thats not a sign, when customers have to get creative on how to eat at your place without breaking the bank, take a good hard look at how you might make your customers more happy. 
Look at it this way Fox team.

"OK, let's face it: there are better steaks in the Valley. As a matter of fact, if you just took the steak at face value, it might not even crack the top 5. 

But Durant's is not just about the steak, or even the food. 

Durant's is a classic in every sense of the word, the type of place that can rarely be found anywhwere in Phoenix. It's also a lively and classy night spot, something that didn't exist anywhere in downtown Phoenix for years, and as several new places have developed around Durant's overe the past few years, it has remained consistent and cool. 

And that's what Durnat's is really about. Yeah, the steak is pretty good. The seafood's alright. The bread with the hot garlic butter is awesome. But Durant's is just COOL. It's classic Vegas, Rat Pack-style cool, and you feel it from the moment you walk in.",1
"Oh Chipotle, I love you.  Healthy options even when craving Mexican!  My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl with fajita veggies.  Served on a bed of rice with black beans and pico de gallo, with some spicy corn thrown in....ahh my mouth is watering already.  I've been to many locations, and all are clean, food quality is excellent, service is friendly and professional, and I always leave satisfied.  5 stars to you, my friend.",1
"This place is solid...solid...solid...plus its right across the street from my job...the crunchy tacos with chicken, corn salsa, pico de gallo, green salsa, cheese, lettuce and guacamole...yum yum yum...I love their salad dressing so I like to put it on my tacos too!  It is very busy during lunch so expect there to be a line...but do not worry they move quickly and it will not take too long!  They are very friendly there and I cannot complain about a thing...I just cannot say it compares to some of my 4 and 5 star reviews.",0
"The two things that jettison my brain into a Barrio Cafe daydream are:

1)  The Sangrita
2)  The Churro dessert

In fact, if this place was called ""Barrio Sangrita and Churro Shop"", i would still want to run up to the building and give it a big hug.

Really, enough has been said here about the food, or atmosphere, or whatevs ... but if they're hoping to leave a legacy in Phoenix, its with these two items.

I prefer going to BC for brunch on Sunday.  I enjoy that menu the best.  Oh, and the table side Guac is a nice touch.",1
"One of my favorite boutiques in Scottsdale, I can always find something I don't need but have to have at Elan.  Lisa and her entire staff are friendly, helpful, and always have great suggestions.  They keep the inventory fresh and edgy.  Some of the pieces I've gotten there never fail to get compliments.  It can be a little pricy, but everything I've gotten there is well-made and things I'll wear again and again so... Lisa puts on some great events and really engages with her customers.",1
"An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix, we hadn't been in over a year and came for a birthday party.  They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.

There are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade, so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.

There are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game, sand art, and/or face painting.  All are a big hit with the kids, but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece.  Everyone is a winner at ball toss, by the way.",1
"I discovered this place on my way to a comedy show! It was a Saturday night with an ASU game on and was not packed so we stopped in to get a drink and a bite to eat. First impression was nice! Everything looked clean and open, which i didn't expect from the outside appearance. 
The service was kinda slow. I have worked in the restaurant/bar industry for 10+ years and I understand how things can go wrong that the customers don't see so i am not going to be hard on these guys. (By the way, the girls are all dressed pretty skimpy and the guys are just short of guidos, so if you have small kids this may not be the place to bring em) So the drink service was slow and throughout we never were really sure who our server was. One girl took our drink order, another brought them, someone else took our food order, someone else brought our food, and someone else came over to see if all was ok... There had to be 15 employees and maybe 25 customers, not to mention the kitchen staff. 
So the service was slow and not sure why because we were constantly seeing the staff goofing around with one another and as mentioned before it was not busy. BUT the associates were very nice the entire time so it was not bad service my any means, just slow and a little unattentive. 
It seemed to turn into a club style late at night, which could explain the extensive staff. 
There is a wheel that you can spin with different actions on it, such as, ""kiss a random' '50% off bill"" ""go plastic"" (which apparently gives you a chance to win plastic surgery). I would suggest NOT attempting this if you are not single. 
Overall, the food was GREAT!!!! The place was clean (bathrooms could use attention). The service could use some tweeking. But we were happy with it!",0
"When I heard about this company opening in the valley, I was pretty excited.  Something new!!!  But when I got to one of these stores, I was disappointed.

Imagine:  A smaller Whole Foods meets IKEA.  Sounds interesting doesn't it?  Unfortunately they do not execute it very well.  There was nothing there that I couldn't get at Trader Joes at a lower price.  There wasn't any thing new or even different.  Sure you can get your Tide, Crest toothpaste and some other name brands there, but the place seemed to lack a soul.

If you need just one thing, this would be a good place to run in and out.  But if your looking to do the bulk of your shopping here...why not just go to Safeway? Maybe that's the point, but what really shocked me is that the prices here were not any better than Fry's or Safeway.  Trader Joes at least has really cheap prices and you know 90% your getting high quality stuff.  Plus TJ's is different from your normal shopping experience....the marketing is fun and the stuff you get there you generally cannot get anywhere else.  I did not sense any of this with Fresh and Easy.  It seemed sterile.

If you like F&E....good for you!!!   I just don't see the value nor the selection.  The idea of this place is great.  They just don't get the American market.",0
"It seems to be a constant challenge to find a bar and restaurant in the east valley that is not only NOT a chain but that also has a great atmosphere, an attentive wait staff, a fabulous wine list, and a unique food selection (without being too out of the ordinary).   Vintage 95 has all of these!  Not to mention how refreshing it was to deal with a hostess, Jocelyn,  that wasn't 16 years old and actually knew what she was doing!  When we were seated our waitress, Emily was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive,  and never rushed us.  The wine list is extensive, however, I think they should add more low range wines in the $25-$35 range to their list.   The warm and cozy decor of the place makes you want to stay and eat and drink for hours.  The outdoor patio in the back has a great fire pit and romantic lighting.  I HIGHLY suggest making a reservation or you could be waiting a long time for a table.  There was a problem with one of our entrees and the manager took care of it immediately.  I look forward to my next visit to Vintage 95.",1
"I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today.  I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job.  Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired.  The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color.  The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color.  It looks terrible!!!  They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread, no improvement.  Now the thread just looked dirty.  I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair.  They just kept saying in thick accent.  ""It's good, I fixed it good"".  They would not refund the amount I prepaid,  (prepay only store), or redo it with the correct color thread.  Just kept saying.  ""I fixed it good"".  Looks like I'll be finding a new shoe repair place.",0
"Makes the job of shipping packages a lot less miserable.
I can purchase any supplies needed, heck--they will even fill out the forms!
I come bring all my packages here, ship them whatever method I want and get it all done without stressing.

While I hate dealing with shipping things... this place makes it even a bit fun with their service with a smile and fun conversation added in.",1
I've been going here for the past 9+ years and it's pretty much the basic local circle-K. Not much to say past that. I do dig the walk-in beer cooler but also wonder who in the hell buys the bags of bananas?,0
"I'm in (puppy) love with the new Wag N'Wash in Scottsdale...

I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live!

Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!

Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc...

I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!",1
"I have been to this Museum twice so far. And both times I enjoyed myself. But this place is huge. There is so much to see if you are into Native American art or just art and lifestyles, history of Native Americans. I love it. I was recently there to see the Indian Market and seen the Boarding School exhibit and Kachina exhibit. I love seeing all the Kachina dolls. When ever I am in town I know I will always go there to check out the new exhibits.",1
Wow these folks know customer service!  We like the fact there are always managers on the floor keeping things moving and tables clean.  Food is good and at a good price point.  A nice friendly well run place!,1
"I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out.",0
"in addition to sucking, it's also expensive.",0
"I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.

Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.

When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. 

I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. 

To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.

I love this place and hope I always will.",1
"I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:

1)I have only been to this place once.
2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine.
3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one.

That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.

About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.

We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.  All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). 

Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, ""I can't imagine it will be much longer."" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.

Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?

We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything.",0
"My street cred is that I'm from the South. You know, home of fried things. I think I know a thing or two about fried chicken and sweet tea.

Understand the whole concept of being quaint and family-run, but seriously didn't think it lived up to all the hype.

I ordered some sweet tea. I was mondo thirtsy and couldn't wait to wrap my hands around that mason jar. Holy guacamole! The sweet tea tasted like a cavity waiting to happen. I was tempted to order a lemonade to make an Arnold Palmer, but feared that it would be overly sweet versus tart. Instead, I requested a glass of water and some lemons to help with the sugar ratio. I still couldn't get it to taste ""normal"" and sort of just abandoned it. 

I had the Lo-Lo entree which consisted of 3 small pieces of dark chicken and 2 waffles. I also ordered a side of mac & cheese - cause I'm dirty like that. I thought for sure the food would be the saving grace...hells nah! Chicken was aight, but hardly any meat. The mac-and-cheese was just okay. Kind of reminded me of stuff you can get from Luby's. If it weren't for the waffles, I'd be hungry. I pretty much ate my waffles and stole my friend's fried okra - which WAS good. I dunked some of my chicken into her side of gravy and SHAZAAM it was like licking a salt mine!

Needless to say, we had a rather lengthy wait before our food arrived and while I do appreciate the hole-in-the-wall appeal - I was disappointed nonetheless. Sometimes you just can't believe the hype!",0
"Unfortunately I don't get enough chances to come here but, I'd say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.  The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.  Yes it is in Tempe and you're stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if you're in the Tempe area!",1
"I really like Maizie's, but unfortunately will not get to go as often anymore. I hate to report that after our last visit, my husband received a bad bout of food poisoning. It was, in fact, his first time puking in approximately 10 years. It was not pleasant for him and it was not pleasant for me. For that reason, I guess I'm going to have to drop one star from my previous review. 

The thing is, I really love Maizie's. I love their menu and I love their atmosphere. Unfortunately, the portobello sandwich...or maybe it was the cottage cheese...just doesn't love my husband and that means I don't get to visit quite as often.  :(",1
"Thanks to Amy D. for also introducing me to this quaint joint.

The smell of home cooking lured me in, Great menu selections with sandwiches salads and hot dishes too, along with the daily specials which I think is one of each (sandwich , salad, hot meal).

Sandwiches come with fresh potato chips and a pickle spear,
I decided to try the Tuna since they don't put onions in it ,Hallelujah!(see pics)

You know what it was pretty tasty, I even ate all my chips and the pickle! My only complaint was the bread was a tad dry, but hey it happens.

Tucked into a commercial business park I never would have found this on my own, but I have fantasized about going back next time I'm in the area, Maybe Amy D. will take me out to lunch again :)",1
"My bf and I drove in from ""the city"" lol and met some friends here for brunch.  We didnt have to wait long to get seated which was great.  The waitress came and took our drink order and right away she didnt seem too thrilled.  So I ordered an omelet and asked for turkey sausage instead of the toast or pancakes it came with, she looked at me like I was asking for a cure to cancer and proceeded to tell me that I would have to be charged full-price.  Well duh, I kinda figured and since I asked it was probably ok.  Needless to say, we waited 30 mins to get our food, which we had to ask her for.  My omelet was cold, I didnt get the turkey sausage I had ordered but she did add it to the check.  Thank god we had a groupon or else it would have been a total loss.  The Breakfast Club in Old Town is better!",0

"This was the launch of our ""Seven Summits"" of Phoenix mountaineering adventure.  Our goal is to reach all of the seven summits by the end of April and we are off to a great start. Although it took us two attempts (two separate visits) to reach the summit, we did it with a few breaks and plenty of gasping along the way on New Years day. It was our way of starting the New Year on the more active side of things.  This hike really gave us a great work out with the steeper parts of the path allowing for a good sweat.  The trail is a continuous climb with a few resting spots and with plenty of photo ops to the summit. It does get pretty crowded and parking can be an issue on the weekends after the early hours. There are picnic tables, ramadas, restrooms and of course a stunning 360-degreee view once you reach the summit.",1
"I was impressed with their menu and drink selection. 3 different sized cups, all kinds of flavors. They also have these ""bowls"" which look so enticing! Consists of fruit, granola, acai, honey etc. they have a few different  kinds but they look so good for being healthy for ypu :). Honestly, i think they have maybe more to offer than Jamba does. I had the Pina-cool-ada, and i feel in love with it. They break down the calories of each drink depending which size cup you get also. I'm all about information at my fingertips and they had everything I needed/wanted to know laid out nicely.  You get a free boost as well.. fat burner, energy etc. They also serve different kinds of pretzels as well. 

It was my first visit here so forgive me because i know i am leaving some things off...but this goes to show you the menu is extensive cause I damn sure cannot remember all of it.

Next time you're in the mood to get your juice on.. Check out Juice it up... see if it titillates your senses as it did mine. :0",1
"mid-afternoon is definitely different than dinner. still tasted good.

we usually get the layered dip, it's totally messy and not as good as i think it should be, but i like it anyhow.

i get the durango burro and matt gets some combo monstrosity.

service is...meh, average. queso is tasty.",0
Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and I love that they have Hoegaarden on tap.. I've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing. They serve New Mexico cuisine here. The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans. I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant. The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive.,1
Still not much hair to cut but Helen does a good job and has developed a following of both men and women.  Don't spread the word or I will have to wait longer.,1
"I'm very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona.  First, they provide us with John McCain.  Then, Jan Brewer.  Then they crap SB 1070 all over us, which we didn't even vote on.  I've never received anything but lousy politics from these people.",0
"I love pueblo pediatric also!  And, also surprised there aren't any reviews!
There staff is always friendly and helpful. Rooms are always clean.
 I take my baby to Dr. Salek. He always answers all of our questions and never makes us feel ""stupid"" for asking. He also takes his time and even asks us how we are doing. Most physicians these days are in and out of the room before you can even feel like your questions are answered, but Dr. Salek really takes his time. 
I went in during a very busy day...flu season actually.  My baby had a fever and I called the office to fit me in. They did surprisingly and I saw Dr. Salek. He examined my baby and reassured me his fever is fighting off infection and not to worry.  Well as any mom, I was worried and continued with my questions...I was there for 30 min with him and not once did he make me feel rushed. I even thanked him for squeezing us in and he replied ""we would rather stay later to see all our sick patients than to send you to urgent care because we are overbooked"". 
Now that's what I call service...if only MY doctor would fit me in and not send me to urgent care!
I haven't seen the other physicians but am sure they are just as good! Also, they are a private practice from what I know so each physician owns part of the practice...meaning they take pride in what they do!",1
"This is my very first review and I can't say I feel bad for what I am about to write. I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read (best hot dog ever, amazing hotdog., etc) oh man were we disappointed.  I'd have to say I'd go to cocstco for a hotdog for $1.50 with a drink.",0
"Love the food here.  Been here a few times and got the peanut curry twice and been delish.  Thai iced tea was great as well.  Only been there during lunch and everything seems pretty good so far.  Went with coworkers and family and they all loved it too.  Service was fast, prompt and nice.  Will be back again to try other dishes.",1
"Surprised by unexpected North Phoenix location.  Attentive but not bothersome service. Antipasto platter shared among 3 people plenty for all.  The Chianti was splendid! The entre arrived piping hot, very impressive.  The food was delicious.  Lovely intimate dining. Reccommend.
 Only down side was it became so dim, had a hard time reading menu.  A bit more uplighting, please.",1
One thing I like about this place...are the cacti! There are just everywhere! This is a great place to go camping in and to take lots of pictures of the scenery. The random people here are all very friendly and so are the staff from the Visitor Center.  The place definitely looks different when you compare from summer and winter.,1
"This place has to get all five stars. Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices. This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.

5 Top reasons I love La Condesa:
 ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors. 
 ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all
 ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal
 ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback.
 ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.

***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.***",1
"I love that the food was freshly made and the place had a great ""down home"" feel.  The owners are also very welcoming, made us feel like family.  We ordered the Bean Enchiladas, Chicken Enchiladas & Chicken Gorditas.  All came with Rice & Beans.  We all enjoyed our meals.  Good prices also.",1
"This is a nice asian take-out style restaurant (you can order and sit down too). The portions are pretty big, and they have a good selection. WAAAAAAY better than Pei Wei which is in the same shopping center. 

The only downside is their breading is a little heavy, but other than that I have enjoyed everything I have tried there.",1
"I had looked at several invitation websites along with catalogs with no luck in finding just the right balance of wedding colors/design.  Thomas at Alphagraphics helped me every step of the way of designing and printing our wedding invitations and programs.  I knew I wanted a booklet-style, but needed a little design creativity from Alphagraphics which they nailed!  I highly recommend Alphagraphics to anyone needing any print work done - not just wedding invitations.  Thomas and his crew are stellar!!",1
"Ice Ice Baby...
Ice Ice Baby...

All right stop collaborate and listen;
Ice Now is here and it's got my attention 
Make some drinks - not warm but frosty;
And believe me when I say they are not costly
Will it ever melt? yo I don't know.
Give them a call and they'll show
To the extreme I yelp like a sandal;
Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle
... Ice ice baby

PS - not sure where the sandal line came in but writing a review in lyric form is a challenge!  This is the best I can do for now...

Need ice for an event?  Call Ice Now! They offer free delivery and their pricing is surprisingly cheap.

And good luck getting the Ice Ice Baby lyrics out of your head... (sorry)!",1
"3 1/2 Stars.

Girl's choice last night.... and we (my sister, my niece Carol, and myself) ended up at the Famous Dave's in Chandler. These Famous Dave's look like every other one... typically bright Orange and Yellow! At night, you must have deficient eyesight if you can't find a Famous Dave's! In the evening, Famous Dave's is just a lighthouse beacon in the middle of a drab mall!

On the menu...

Blue Margarita (** 1/2) made with Blue Curacao - It's disconcerting when the last time you saw your niece she was just drinking Cokes... now it's Blue Margaritas. Must be getting old. In summary... not very toxic. Could have drank this in one gulp and wouldn't have had an effect! Machine mixed and made. Looked cool, though, with an Aquamarine Blue color.

All American BBQ Feast (****) Gimmick is that all this stuff ( Full Slab of St Louis style SpareRibs (*****), Whole BBQ Chicken (*** 1/2), 1/2 lb of Texas Beef Brisket (*****), Famous Fries (*****), 2 Baked Potatoes with all the Fixin's (*****) replaced the Coleslaw and Wilbur Beans, 4 Corn on the Cob (***), 4 Muffin Style Corn Bread (****) ) is served on a bright, shiny, galvanized Garbage Can lid. Some of the items definitely lacking in BBQ flavor.

Hot Fudge Kahlua Brownie (**) Warm, Walnut covered Chocolate Brownie, soaked with Kahlua Liquer and topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, and (loads and loads of) Whipped Cream. Ice Cream and Kahlua was no-where to be found!

Total tab: $82.08. Not bad for the amount of food.

Service (****) This is a total generalization... but what the heck! The wait-staff at Famous Dave's is totally opposite from the previous evening's robotic lifeless performance from the wait-staff at Olive Garden ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-chandler#hrid:l6HajH2UNtb1EZMTj19Ccg  ). I really don't give a darn if it's just a performance... the attitude that the wait-staff presents will be passed onto the customers... whether bad or good.

Typical of all Famous Dave's you sit at a booth or table covered with Red and White checkered table-cloths. At the front entrance is a display of all the BBQ awards that Famous Dave's BBQ items have won.... mostly in the MidWest. Check out the lead-pipe utilitarian interior design... Cool!

Very colorful and festive atmosphere! Kids or adults with a kid's attitude will love Famous Dave's.",1
"You know the story about the cobbler who created all those adorable shoes for the elves in the village? Ok, so maybe that story doesn't go exactly like that. Regardless, I found Old Town Scottsdale's version of the magical cobbler who can do wonders with shoes and I found it at Tony's Shoe Repair! Here, Tony keeps shoes in spic and span condition and if you bring them in looking anything but shiny and new, you can be sure they will be returned as good as new. Tony's Shoe Repair also handles purses and belts. They do everything for a shoe including simple repairs such as widening and adding those little tricky bottom parts of heels that never seem to last, to giving your worn our shoes an entire face lift. The prices here are reasonable and he does the work for you in a speedy time frame. I dropped off my sad looking boots off and he freshened them up and added new heel bottoms to them in a day's time. The fairytales can keep their magical cobblers, here in the real world we've got something even better -- Tony's Shoe Repair!",1
"Not good. The patio is top notch for relaxing if the weather's good but I couldn't shake that chain feeling when inside. Table and chairs had a slightly sticky feeling to them (nice, eh?). Food was typical pre-cooked, oven heated dollop of too much grease and cheese. Not impressed. It's a shame cause the garden and even the nachos & salsa had me expecting big things.",0
"Am I missing something here? I've actually been back to America's. Twice after my first visit, convinced that I had accidentally gone to the wrong America's or perhaps stumbled into a nearby taco shop on 7th. 

Alas, the helpful Yelp photo informs me that I have, in fact, now eaten three times at the Famous America's Taco Shop.

I can't emphasize how incredibly average and underwhelming the fare here is. See, I'm a burrito man, myself. I don't claim to know Mexican food or it's various subgenres, but I did live in San Diego for three years and I've definitely had what I would call over-the-top, blow your socks out your a** good Mexican food. The same can be said for any number of burritos. 

America's, I'm sorry to say it, but neither your tacos nor your burritos live up to the incredible hype that now surrounds you (although, the salsa was really, really good).

I'm still on my quest for the Best Burrito in Maricopa County, I'll let you know when I find it fellow yelpers.",0
Pretty delicious -- very tasty sashimi platter. Loved the ambiance too -- a nice respite from the very toasty desert outside. :),1
"I have been a member here for a little less than a year. We go about 2-3x a week & love it! We bought the year pass because it was cheaper that way & we wanted to be more committed than the daily or monthly pass. I have been a member at other gyms but not as impressed as I am with the atmosphere here at Tumbleweed. It has an indoor track to get out of the AZ heat. The gym also offers racquetball which is a fun alternative to workout. They offer an array of classes (Zumba, Yoga, Pilates, Core Conditioning, etc)  which are included in your membership!!!!. You can't find those options for the same rate anywhere else that I know of. The people are professional & friendly - there is no haggling over membership price, commitment, or being approached by personal trainers. On that note, they do not have any personal trainers, which if you are someone who needs motivation or accountability, this probably wouldn't be the place for you. But for the price & option of the daily pass - you could bring a workout buddy anytime!!!  The other side to joining a Rec Center is that you are supporting your city & giving back to the community - not supporting some big money hungry corporation!   Check it out!!!",1
"I have to laugh at the person that stated the service was bad. I have now been three times (can you blame a gal for craving a burger?) and each time everyone is almost too overfriendly. They ask if you have been in before and if you state no, they offer to go over the menu. Now this might stop after this location has been open longer, but it's helpful since there are only a few locations in the valley. When your order is ready, you are paged and you go up to grab your meal, and they always find it necessary to read back your order, when right in your hand is a tray with a juicy burger begging you to take a bite... so I am always a little feisty for them to read it off, since I want to chow down! They also seem to want to check in on you while you are eating, which is nice... but can be overwhelming if you are on your lunch break and trying to catch up with a friend... but I won't complain about good ol' polite customer service. 

I order their original char burger without cheese and without the onions (I did try them with the onions and honestly, I liked the taste of the burger better without)

I like their crispy onion rings, they seem healthy if that is even possible for an onion ring... but they are crispy and not greasy. Try them, you'll understand what I am saying better :)

The fun item I always get ""to go""??? Their coffee flavored milk shake. It's light, it has nice flavor and is a little bit of heaven.

PS: Parking is not like it was with ""My Florist"" there are many more available spaces now, which is totally awesome.",1
"This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctor's office anymore. I started seeing Dr. Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries. He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones. Anyways, He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you. 

I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the P.A. for the first time the other day. She took a lot of time with me, going through my blood work line by line. I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopath...but actually, she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath! So I was really pleased. 

This is a great office and everyone is like family....they also treat you like you are a part of their family. They make your children feel comfortable too. There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch. The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby. They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment! I highly recommend this office.",1
"This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! It's so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this ""fast"" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!",1
"Meh. As my fellow Yelper said to me a few days after we ate here: ""No Brio review, I'm shocked!"" 

I didn't jump on writing this review because I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience. The ambience sucks, the service wasn't very good and the food was totally average. 

My cursor is blinking at me and I still don't know what else to say about my time spent here. 

Ambience- looks like an Italian cheesecake factory. Why are the collumns so huge?!

Service- the bartender kept interrupting us to take our order when we STILL weren't ready. Jeez, does it look like I've moved my menu in the 53 seconds it's been since the last time you checked? And then disappeared when we were finally ready. 

Food- 
-carpaccio, not bad but does it seriously need to be that huge? The two of us didn't even come close to finishing it. 
-Mediterranean pasta, pretty much the only one without a cream sauce on the whole menu. They split it for us which was nice and it tasted all right with mushrooms and chicken and stuff. 
-tiramisu came out frozen. They were super apologetic and didn't charge us for the replacement, but it was still awkward. They obviously just heated up a piece which made it melty and just not that great.

So yeah, that's that.",0
"I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right.

My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free.",0
"Great breakfast, great service. Yummy!",1
"I had a great experience with this company today.  They sent out their tech Steve to fix my Samsung tv.  He arrived on time and was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.  He also provided some helpful tips to improve the performance of the tv in other areas unrelated to the issue.

The service was professional, prompt, and efficient.  I would definitely use them again in the future.",1
"Cozy place, great amounts of food for little money, they serve koolaide!!!!  Its all great I loved it both times so far, once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper, and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance",1
"I could spend hours in this place. In fact, I know I have. There are so many things to look at and it's way more than just books. They have a ton of cards and stationary as well as fun trinkets. If you're into used books, this is the place to go. I've found nearly mint condition vintage books here and they've made the perfect gifts. The people who work here are great as well. They're more than willing to help and offer good recommendations. This is a go to if you're looking for a good read or just want to pop in and explore.",1
"Fuego Bistro is one of my new favorites! A couple people have recommended it to me, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week. 

We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio. The staff was super welcoming and friendly. Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria - both very refreshing. Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu. We're sharers, so we ordered with that in mind. 

Drinks: 
We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good)

Starters: 
Signature empanadas: Tasty. The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside.
Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious!

Entrees: 
Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING! Some of the best we've ever had. The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all. The flavor was so good!
Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!! I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas. 

Sides: 
Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor. 
Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didn't really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go.
Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one! 
Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib. 

Dessert: (By this point, we knew we'd need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week). 
Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream. This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had. The ice cream was excellent!
Banana burrito: exactly what you'd picture with scoops of the same icecream - delicious! 

I can't wait to go back to Fuego and tell my friends about it. Great service, charming atmosphere, and excellent dishes.... Fuego is a winner!",1
This place is consistant with it's good Chinese food. The staff is courteous the place is clean. Want Chinese take out in Tolleson come here. =0),0
So yummy!  I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it & didn't even feel guilty.  Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner. I can't wait to go again!,1
veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.,0
"I LOVE this place. The marijuana theme isn't kid-friendly though, so DONT bring your kids. Just bring it home to them.

Their subs are really tasty, the theme (for adults) is hilarious, the people are friendly, and are reasonably priced.

Also, the potato salad is fantastic!",1
"I always forget and tell people that Pomeroy's is on Central. I think it must just be that cool - I'm trying to pull it closer to the other really good places to go. It is, in fact, on 7th St. and if you tie it on a little tight, the grocery behind is, in fact, open late. 

It looks like a bar that should have a few regular bar flies and music that screeches to a halt when someone new walks in. And by that, I mean it's the most endearingly divey of bars.

There's shuffleboard, just give your id to the bartender in return for the pucks. There's pool, but you pay quarters for that. The juke box is electronic and you should expect that you're gonna hear Def Leppard at least once during the night. The regulars will help you learn darts, the food is griddle-fare and the guys behind the bar are always good for a chat or to grab you a pint. 

Pomeroy's should definitely be on your rotation of places to be in Phoenix.",1
If you have never been before you should really try harder... Your mother taught you better than that. Go and buy a smoked pecan paleta.,1
"Been to this place only once.  Coming from Chicago the experience at this place was ok, but I've had much better.  Would not go again since I think there are better places out here.",0
"I live down the street from Casey Moore's. I have been here a total of three times. The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple ""I'll be back with your orders."" When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back. And I can't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this, so I am left to rant here on Yelp, completely unsatisfied. Sigh...",0
"Went here for a saturday lunch with a girlfriend. The building is amazing and beautiful, very clean. I'm not generally a ""Scottsdale crowd"" type of gal, but the place was nice, and the music was good too. The menu looked so delicious that we had a hard time deciding what to get. Our waiter was very kind, didn't try to rush us, and gave us plenty of time to decide. 

We had a house salad, dirty chips, and an order of sliders. The house salad seemed a bit over priced for what it was, but the dirty chips were really good! The sliders were average, and well priced.

I really want to go back and try a happy hour sometime to try more of the small plates, our only regret was that the order of dirty chips was BIG, we could only finish half of it. A half sized portion would have been perfect, though!",1
"There's no doubt about it, both Mamma Mia locations deliver some great pizza on the cheap. This Mamma Mia is now the closer of the two to my house, and at first I was a little worried. I wasn't sure if both locations were going to be good, but I'm not worried anymore.

Whenever I go there, I get slices. I also usually only spend about $6. To me, that's awesome when I'm craving some pizza pie. By the way, Mamma Mia serves good ol' fashoined NY-style pizza. Their toppings range from traditional (roni, sausage, veggies) to fancy (salmon, bleu cheese, capers). I have been known to order capers on my slices (and they were actually really good). Normally I ask for the slices well done, and I'd recommend you do the same if you like that extra bit of crispiness like me. The slices come out relatively quickly, and I've never been dissatisfied with what I've been given.

I've yet to try their sandwiches or pastas, but in time I'm sure I'll get around to it. At $6 or less a pop, I feel like I've got a good thing going. If I'm in the mood for pizza and I don't feel like traveling far or spending much, Mamma Mia is towards the top of my list.",1
"I first saw this place while I was on light rail going to basket ball game. The stop is nearby and it makes it easy to get to. The food here is very good! Everything I get here tastes home made and offers just the right amount of spice. Their salsas are very delicious! I always get the enchiladas or the bean burritos served enchilada style. Both the red and green sauce are very tasty. The service is always very fast and helpful. We came here late one night and were one of the only people left, but the waitress never hurried us and was very courteous.",1
"It has been quite the challenge to find good Chinese food in AZ. But I love this place. From the customer service to the quality of food, we are never disappointed. I am a huge fan of their fried rice and wonton soup. My 5 year old loves the sesame chicken, and their beef skewers are good. We find that the best value is either the dinner for about 19.99 or getting the food to go. For some reason, we get more to-go than eating there. But either way the quality is good. The servers remember your names and family. They are genuine provide great reasons to return. We eat there about every other week. If you want to try them, go lunch. You cannot beat their prices.",1
"If only it wasn't all the way up there... i'd be on it like a lush at the FEZ happy hour... margaritas, martinis oh my! Anyways that's how I would describe my dinner outing to Los Reyes de la Torta with my best, Sara V. 

She thought of it and I bought it... so off we went after work on Monday night to Los Teyes de la Torta for some Torta goodness. The only Torta I've had prior is at Gallo Blanco. and they Ribeye there is delicious but here we were at Los Reyes and the menu was huuugggge! Sara V. was hungry so we started with an app, the chicharron quesadilla estilo del rey which is with queso, pico, onions, and jalapenos. I got horchata as a drink, and Sara V. got mango juice. Felt tropical and I guess it went with the feeling of mugginess outside. Anywho, the quesadilla was big, and really a meal in itself. For our entrees we decided to split two tortas, they were the Arizona Torta  and the Mexicana Torta - steak, sauteed onions, jalapenos. They were both big in its own right, half a torta is filling on its own. 

Sum up our experience, the tortas are really good, altho i can always pass up the Mexicana and try something else. The horchata was alright, nothing phenomenal unlike La Condesa which has a very interesting and really yummy Horchata. Not a big fan of Mexican mangoes coz personally I don't think that they're sweet, Filipino mangoes are still Queen! The quesadilla was yummy, liked it very much. I think it's proof that when more than half their clientele are Latinos is that it's a good torta shop. The dinner was not pricey and I had leftovers but really liked it and will come back soon!",1
".  Angel, daughter of the Lounge's owner Joy is a HOOT!!  I love her personality.  It's not a fancy place, little hole in the wall type place. They have been open for 8 years and have had a pretty steady following.  There is art on the walls (LOVE the Dizzie Gillespie painting... thinking of buying it) painted by a local artist.  Live music on Wednesdays/Fridays.  Wednesdays step classes (the Al B. look alike) and they have another separate dining-type area.  Wednesday nights they hold something called a conversation party.  Random 5 topics are chosen (we had a peek at last night's conversations) EX:  Are momma's boys a good or bad thing?   What makes a partner in a relationship think they need to start playing games?  What is most important to you in your professional career?

Apparently some of these discussions, as you can imagine - adding the alcohol ingredient - can get pretty heated.  It seemed to be a big group last night... 15-20 people.  

So after dinner, catfish, PORK CHOPS TO DIE FOR!! So tender, fried hot wings, mac 'n cheese, mashed potatoes, LOTS AND LOTS of hot sauce, we heard the band start warming up.   YES!!  GREAT music.  People walked in wearing their Sunday best and others walked in wearing jeans.  It's an everyone knows everyone's name type of place.  Older people and the younger started trickling in around 8PM.  

Definitely a fun experience.  Good times.",1
"The BEST brewery I've ever been to. Amazing beer and awesome food (I didn't think that combo was actually possible)! I daydream about this place all the time since I spent so much time here while going to school at ASU. Whenever I go back to Phoenix, this is always a must on my list!",1
"Never thought I'd review a supermarket, but since it's tough times for alot of people out there, I'd like to share my 2 cents..

First of all, you don't need a card.  The deals are for everyone and it makes it hassle-free during checkout.  Now, about the deals ~ I find that Albertsons has the lowest prices and best deals and you can find them amonst any product you're looking for.  It's WAY cheaper than Safeway for sure.

This is what i found yesterday:  88 cents for 2 (yes two!) snicker bars or other comparable chocolate bars, $1 for a bag of lifesavor hard candies, and $14.99 for a 24 bottle case of coors light.  They also had 69 cent bags of frozen veggies that people were buying like crazy.  Also, this location has really good cuts of meat.  I'm Korean and was so excited that they had short ribs cut perfectly for Kalbi jjim (korean braised shortribs), and for $3.99 a pound, it was quite a deal!",1
"This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley! Fav's is always consistent and their prices are excellent! My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito, it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had. Also, their green and red sauce is a step above the competition, and they have great mexican rice, it comes with peas and carrots! Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!",1
"Second chance at bolero's.
After receiving a phone call from one of the managers regarding our visit in April, we decided to try again.  We were told they would make things right and they were very apologetic for the horrible evening we had.  (We were so irritated with the place, we waited 4 months to take him up on the offer)
As an aside, we were told we would be comped dinner due to the previous disaster.

I called ahead and spoke to Jason, who does not work at Bolero's any longer, but stated that since he was the manager at the time the incident occurred, he would make sure the new manager was aware that they needed to adhere to his promise to make things right.  Was told to call manager Desi, but no one answered.  Proceeded to the restaurant and hoped for the best.  

When we got there, as before, we stood at the front desk for between 5 and 10 minutes before anyone came to seat us.  Not a promising start.  Luckily though, that's where the lame service ended.

We had Gage as a server and he did a terrific job.  He was attentive, stopped by to fill our drinks often, checked to make sure our food was good, brought things out all at the same time, and was pleasant to deal with.  

We started with the cheese plate and it was, as before, good although probably could use some more bread with it as there are a ton of meats and cheeses and 4 small pieces of bread.  As far as the food goes, she had the spinach salad, and I had the reuben with onion rings.  Both dishes were well prepared and tasty.  We asked for a basket of bread, which was brought out with dinner.  The bread was great, but they maybe ought to consider bringing it out early, maybe just asking people if they'd like bread with their meal.  Just a suggestion.

Our only other concern as far as the menu goes is that there are not a lot of vegetarian offerings that aren't salad.  

Overall, it was a much better experience.  As we said before, Gage did a great job, and even though Jason is no longer the manager there, Dave (who was standing in for Desi, from what we were told) took care of everything.  They put effort into making this experience much better and they did a good job.  We both appreciated it and we'd go back.

There it is, an updated review.  Bolero's is in a beautiful location and now we can say the service & food are worth a visit.",1
"My prom date brought me here 10 years ago. Hmm...I wonder what he was expecting at the end of the night. Although he thought that tanning until he was as red as a lobster was the new black this was one of his better judgment calls.  

We had a window seat and I mesmerized him with fascinating facts about the city, which were on little plaques along the windows. It really took him until the end of dinner to figure it out. Anyway, I am sure the menu has changed, but the salad and shrimp with angel hair pasta I had that night were yummy. Cool view. I will have to come back sometime to see how the valley has changed from this view.",1
"This place is a good go to when you're looking for a mexican infused panda express.  Haha.  Yum!  I got the combo meal with the Jade Red chicken made into a quesadilla and the diablo chicken.  Really good!  I also got jerk fried rice.  The beans were also very good.  Yummy in my tummy.  I really enjoyed Chino Bandido's, but don't think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (I'd get very large from eating like this!).  :D  Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, don't just get a quesadilla by itself.  My poor brother thought the quesadilla would be huge and good enough for his dinner (thinking taqueria size), but it was pretty sad and small.  Luckily, my combo wasn't that small and I had extra food to share.",1
"I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot), I was not getting enough massage to make much progress, I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.  They had the right touch, pressure and listened to what I needed.   Going back for more...",1
"The quintessential Brewery with a wholly fantastic kitchen. Best spinach artichoke dip in the valley, period. From fried to gourmet Four Peaks has it all. Beerbread sandwiches are always excellent, fish and chips, bavarian pretzels, french fries, daily specials, I really haven't had an item that I didn't like! The weather is perfect right now for a sunny patio lunch or fresh air dinner. 

Let's not forget the beer. My favorites are the Oatmeal Stout or the Peach. Their peach beer is legendary with low sweetness and a crisp refreshing taste. If you think cider is too sweet but like fruity flavor, this is your beer. The oatmeal stout is thick and hearty with no bitterness. Seasonal beers abound, pumpkin porter in the fall, I've seen an orange blossom, belgian white, barleywine, etc.

Parking close can be a challenge on weekend nights, best to ride your bike if you're close enough.

Just go there already!",1
"Yup. Definitely a fancy mall for that credit card burning session.

A combo of outdoor and indoor. You probably can find most everything the average person can't afford here. 

It seems to be the spot for malling in Scotsdale.",1
"In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here.",1
Went to see Under the Sea in 3D......awesome on the big screen and the 3D was fantastic. The staff were helpful and friendly only missing a star because it could use a little upgrade......this however does not effect your viewing.....and there were no annoying advertisments before the show....so refreshing! There are two other nature shows playing at the moment.....African Adventure in 3D and Dinosaurs Alive in 3D. Great for the kids too as it is only 40 minutes long.,1
Nice clean place with good food.  Shrimp burrito - pretty tasty.,1
"Totally excited to try this place out, my grandparents, my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food. It wasn't too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out. 

Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken. 

As we were looking at the ""lunch special"" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom ""are you Chinese?"" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in ""what does that mean?"" The lady proceeded by pointing at the ""seafood pancake"" section on the menu and saying ""I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot."" Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else... 

So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini ""kimchi"" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. 

By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn't take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. 

In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said ""you can't take that home"". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said ""you are not allowed to take the kimchi home"". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? ""Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?"" She hesitantly gave me a lid.

""Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'""... only if I said that to her face...

Oh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.  

Conclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service, please just go to Chodang. Chodang is WAYYY BETTER, hands down",0
Great place to take the kids to play and have some bbq. Nice outdoor area and good solid bbq.,1
Jake's been taking care of our cars for almost 7 years. He's very trustworthy and fair.,1
"If your boyfriend is a baseball player and is in Spring training.... Watch out for the heat...as it gets SOOO HOOOOOT and SOOOO DRY...... i literally had to stand with my legs apart and my hands on my waist to air what needs to be aired.

Yup. Support thy boyfriend..... I can't wait to come back here this May for Minor League Spring training! I probably will be wearing a bikini and a see through dress. 

But really..I've never seen fields so well managed here... I've only been to where the Royals practice....and It's quite amazing! This May, i'd definitely see games at the Texas side.",1
"I think ordinarily I would give this place 3 stars, but this review is based on my experience here on New Year's Eve.  After attending a Coyotes game, we came over to the Yard House for a late dinner.  Not surprisingly, the place was packed but we were able to find a couch to sit on outside during our 1.5 hour wait for a table.  Yeah, that's a long time to wait for this place, but like I said it was NYE and we didn't have any later plans, so we didn't mind hanging out.  Coincidentally, you can get full bar and menu service on the couches outside and we enjoyed some drinks while happily waiting for a proper table and chairs for dinner.

The food was OK; nothing really to write home about.  My favorite part of the meal was probably dessert - the warm brownie with ice cream was a treat!  When we finished our meal, it was about 11:15 p.m. - definitely too late to go somewhere else to countdown to the new year.  So, we hung out.  Our waitress, Jaime, was very friendly and surprisingly attentive for how busy the restaurant was.  She gave us festive top hats, tiaras, and beads to wear to celebrate.  We were also provided with champagne for a midnight toast.   All of this was free, and there had been no cover charge to get in.  I thought that was a really nice touch.  At ten minutes to the hour, the music turned off and the volume on the TVs, which had all been switched to the big ball drop in NYC, was turned up.  Everybody in the restaurant excitedly awaited the arrival of the new year and when the clock struck 12 there was toasting and cheering.  Yeah, this may all sound very mellow, but it was a fun, relatively cheap (given that every other place had a cover charge and/or price fixe menu), safe place to bring in the new year.",1
Have alread posted a review but had to add that a friend at work ordered vegan chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were sooooooo delicious!! All my nonvegan coworkers LOVED them.,1
"GREAT customer service!  Bought a compromised food item and they assured me that this issue would be corrected immediately. 

Plus they insisted on comping me the BEST MEDJOOL dates I have ever ever tasted.  I had been happy to pay $7 per pound for them because they are utterly superior when purchasing them before.",1
"I'm not really a fan of Jo-Ann.  They don't really do much to help you find what you need.  There are never any helpful people, nothing is labeled properly, and the fabric counter is always a nightmare.  This one is tolerable because no one is ever here.  The people that they hire at this one are just people who need jobs, not people who love crafts.  You better know what you need and where to find it when you go here because it is easy to get lost and there are no Jo-Ann Sherpas to get you back.",0
I love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza. It is just like being back in Chicago. Love it!,1
"All I have to say is wow.  The auto picks and portrait pick that MelonFishPhoto did for me blew my mind.  I felt pretty confident after seeing some of the photos he had done, but my expectations were far exceeded.  He has a creative eye that caught much more than just the personality of the car.  The picture brought tons of people to my sites asking who shot the pics.  The portraits were truly great and fun to do.  I actually saw myself in a new light that I never saw before.  I loved it.  Anyone can take a picture, but very few people can take pictures that draw people in and seem to almost have an active emotion behind them.  I strongly recommend MelonFishPhoto to anyone for any photography need.",1
"I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to state at your ""twin peaks"" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking.",0
"Great place, well maintained. It's big airport with some long walks.",0
"Let's start by making it clear that my dogs are my life. Completely obsessed pet parent here! I went here for a second opinion about one of my dogs after being fed up with my regular vet. I was really impressed with the premises and doctor. She was incredibly caring and helpful, and they did not try to get me to pay for anything additional. I really appreciated the authenticity and the follow up. I am now a regular customer (patient?) and definitely recommend this place for your furbabies :-)",1
"So we went here on Monday to celebrate another milestone in my sweetheart's life. The staff there is awesome and even changed the channel for us to catch a little Monday Night Football as we did our unedited (and OH so funny) version of ""Oh My God What Is S/He Wearing, Volume 2"". 

I am a BIG fan of their Thai Sweet Chili Hot Vings. Those get 4.5 stars easily!

We also had the edamame with their signature spice rub (very yummy, but towards the end it was a teensy bit *greasy* for my taste), the flatbread pizza w/ tandoori chicken, and the banana-nut bread pudding w/ ice cream.  

I wasn't very impressed with the bread pudding, don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but I didn't think it was very flavorful, and I'm always on the lookout for the perfect one. (*note* If there is even the HINT of a raisin in the bread pudding, I will not go near it. I like raisins, some of my best friends are raisins, or something to that effect...just not in my bread *giggle*) 

I love the atmosphere here, it is a GREAT place to do some people watching, the patio is awesome, although I refuse to sit on ANY patio between July and September here...I'm already hot-blooded, I don't need to be reheated in any shape or fashion! 

Great place, great atmosphere, I'm a fan.",1
"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.

Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!

We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.

We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).

Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.

So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...

This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!

And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.

Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.",0
"We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price.  However, we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed.  The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half.  No one assisted us in putting two tables together, we had to do it ourselves.  Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didn't brew it in advance, it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar.  So we've decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips, especially up in north Phoenix.",0
"we went back here again this past weekend...actually we went there 3 more times this past weekend alone!  we couldn't resist the awesome service and great prices...and great live music.  this is definately going to be one of our ""regular joints.""  if you like the country...country girls....and good old rowdy shit..then stop by and check it out for yourself.  i bet you will like this place.  
there is a large dance floor for some shit kickin' ...about 3 pool tables..big buck hunter and an outdoor area for smokin and boozin and dart throwin'.  i love this place.  this is what toby keith should have been singing about...seriously!",1
"Great selection of gelato! Friendly welcoming staff. Reasonably priced, deliciously rich gelato!",1
"I love this place. My gf and I go every time we visit her parents in north scottsdale. 

Pro's
quick and easy. good service. clean. good food. good management. not too expensive. they also post nutrition info on their menu (that alone is laudable). 

cons,

the salad dressing is quite sharp.",1
"Good, fresh chinese food, a little pricey.

There are two types of chinese food. Cheap, greasy, satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint. And upscale atmospheric chinese food that aspires to captivate the same audiences that enjoy places like P.F Chengs. This would be the latter: an awhatukee hole in the wall version of P.F chengs. Very clean restaurant, nice atmosphere, and good service. You can tell their motif is such that they cater to the tukee types with a little more coin in hand :/. This is the kind of place you'll find a lot of older families, or much older groups of friends dining together in. 

Both the orange chicken, and the almond chicken were good, and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease. They were big portions (for $8), with big fresh peices of white meat, fresh vegetables, and no MSG. There is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease, textures, or flavors (which makes it less interesting in my opinion).

Both dishes were good, but nothing amazing from the 2 dishes I tried. 

The green tea ice cream was good, but I've had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream, and could have used some fruit, or something creative to go with the ice cream. 

The only other dessert option was another flavor of ice cream.

The service was great, very polite and friendly waiters.",0
"Tip:  If you know how to play poker...go sit at a poker table, and order the fried rice.  You get your meal for half price while playing poker.

The filet mignon fried rice(ask for it rare and it will come out medium) is excellent!",0
"I really love it here.  There is a big window that looks into the kitchen where you can watch the noodle chef hand make the noodles for your dish.  My favorite is #17, Beef with lemon garlic noodles.  The beef is sliced thin and served cold.  The sauce is a fish sauce, the fish smell is pretty strong, but it doesn't taste strong, the citrus and garlic are more evident.  The only reason I'm not giving 4 stars is because the water taste really funny here.  Opt for a soda.",1
"Delicious, clean, great service! 3 hours later and we are still talking about how delightful this place was. We had the pulled pork and chicken sandwich - both were moist and fresh. Dinner for 2 for 20.00!",1
"Are you serious? $4.50 for domestic beers during the usual ""happy hour"" time? That includes Old Style (we were there for the Cub game)!! At grocery stores you can get a 6-pack of Old Style for $4.50! And charging $5.50 for a Corona?! Cra-zy!

""World Famous Sliders""? These were the worst sliders ever, I think Jack and the Box sliders are better. Almost $10 for six southwestern sliders with a patty the size of a half dollar that got lost in the bun, one jalapeno, a small square of cheese, and salsa to make the bun soggy. I know they have a prime location being right outside of the ballpark and all, but does that really give them the right to charge whatever they want? They are going to make money regardless, they don't have to be greedy about it!",0
"Yeah, it's a chain and while not haute cuisine, we had a very good meal there.  We were there on a busy Saturday night and we had great, friendly and quick service and our food was quite good.  

Not only is it a good value for the neighborhood, I thought it was downright cheap for what you get.  (It's probably roughly comparable to The Hillstone Group's Houston's or Bandera in terms of quality and service at about half the price.)  

Great salads too.

I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for it, but it's a very reasonable choice if you happen to be at Fashion Square.

Dinner for 2 with drinks, about fifty bucks.",1
"Stayed here for my best friends birthday. We just wanted a relaxing weekend and that's what we got. We liked that the pool was open 24-7. There was a bar at the pool but nobody attending it which blew. So we would have to go inside in our bathing suits to order our drinks since they didn't have a menu outside. People say the rooms are dated, but we thought they were nice. We enjoyed every part of our stay with the exception of the bar out by the pool not being open.(If theres a bar, someone should be working it right?)",1
"I've been Dr. Castilla's office for 7 years.  Her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason.  She is a Dr. that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions.  She makes eye contact with you and I couldn't ask for anything more.  Just remember, it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable.  But, she's worth the wait!  
Now that we've relocated, I hate to give up Dr. Castilla.  She's irreplaceable!",1
"This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant - don't let the looks fool you, it is delicious!  I had the Tampiquena, it is one of the best I have had.  Highly recommended",1
"I would recommend a visit if you happen to be in Scottsdale. Papago has a beer for every type of beer drinker. They have 100's of bottles in clear panel refrigerators, and 30 taps some of which are house brewed.
They have a great beer selection and awesome wings. What more do you need from a beer spot?",1
"My husband and I lucked into one of the best dining experiences in a long time on a recent business trip to AZ. The hummous appetizer was exceptional, as was the ""what's in this steak?"" dish, tender filet wrapped in yukon-gold potatoes (how comforting is THAT?). Nice selection of wine by the glass.  The only disappointment was a dessert referred to as a ""twist on Tiramisu,"" but which bore no resemblance to it at all, with toffee cookie dough ice cream. I'll go back next time in town, but try a different dessert.",1
"Overall I am a big fan of this place... first how can you beat a place that is BYO???!!!  You never have to worry about a bad wine list or paying too much because it is your own stuff...  I find the food excellent... they menu is not large and changes often...  but I have never had anything that I have no liked... the chef is defiantly 5 star and since you bring in your own wine the prices don't seem that bad... but it is not exactly cheap... 

The only down fall of the place is that it is real small and has funky hours... I think it is only open Wednesday to Saturday.  I know that they take reservations and I would venture to say that is the only way to actually eat there... This is a nice place for special occasions or a date...",1
"If you're looking for a board game, card game or, well, ANY game you can't find at GameStop, try here! Their selection is huge, from games to figurines to key chains and novelty candy. Better yet, they're friendly and really seem to know what they're talking about. 

They also offer in-store tournaments and competitions. So much fun!",1
"MARGARITA time....I love their ritas on the rocks!!! 

Their shrimp tacos are my favorite in town. I love the salsa bar. The wait staff has always been nice. The prices of  food and drink are great. This is a great place to go with friends to eat good mexican food & kick back a few drinks.
 The patio area is nice all year round.",1
"I don't quite get it. Am I naive, not part of the ""in"" crowd or not tipping the right people? Our experience at Masto's started off a little rocky, but wound up being okay. 

We arrived 15 minutes early for our 6:00 PM reservation Sunday evening, no problem because the place is dead, right? Not so fast! We get taken to the worst table in the farthest corner of the restaurant while passing by 80% of the tables that are empty. Luckily we noticed right away the table would be a good fit for 12 people not a party of two which we were. They graciously reseated us at a small table for two which was much better.

Now, after that you may think, why'd this guy give them four stars. Well they redeemed themselves a little later. My partner ordered an ice tea which they were temporarily out of. How does that happen by the way? Out of Ice Tea? But I digress, they wound up bringing him a complimentary Ice Tea once they had brewed a new batch.

I guess you probably want to know about the food. I started with the Beefsteak Tomato and Onion appetizer which was excellent, my partner loved his loved his French Onion Soup. We both had the Bone-In Kansas City Strip his was a little undercooked and mine was just perfect. We shared the Au Gratin Potatoes and Creamed Spinach...both were excellent.

We'll give it another try sometime when we're in the mood for steak so hopefully we can have a Five-Star experience.",1
"Long wait for food, waitresses that don't know what they're doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again.",0
"While waiting for Ayesha to have dinner at Thai Elephant, I tried not to let the meth-crack-head who pretended to talk on the pay phone deter me from a great meal.  She had no shoes on and walked up to the pay phone and started talking.  It hadn't been ringing and she didn't dial a number.  
I'm a sucker for Touch of Thai's catfish dish, and they had the same one on the menu.  
It was good, but the fish was a bit overcooked.  I would have liked a bit more ""sauce"" as the dish was a bit dry.
Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking throughout our meal.
Of course, spending and evening with Ayesha over spicy food as we both wiped our noses from the heat of curry can't be beat!",1
"Oh Chelsea's your a tricky little spot, you have tasty tuna tacos (by far the best fish taco I've had in phoenix) but that little tuna delight cost 18$ which is no big thang except that I work within walking distance of the place and 18$ for a lunch taco dish is straight baller status. The outside patio is great and the service is what it is, Its a good corporate lunch spot but stay away when it comes to dinner, its kinda boring, OH YEAH IF YOU DRIVE BY THIS PLACE THEY PUT SOME CRAZY TASTY SMELLS IN THE AIR SO BE STRONG AND KEEP DRIVING YOUR WALLET WILL THANK YOU.",0
"Disclaimer, I was raised in New Orleans, and miss good Poor Boys, Crawfish, Boiled shrimp, Jambalaya  etc.... yadda yadda yadda, hear me whine...
 I try to be lenient when I go somplace because it's unreasonable to expect to find the food here that I would at the Magazine St. Po Boy shop. 
I was also raised on popeyes, every once in awhile I would hop off the Streetcar on the way to school and get a Chicken Biscuit w/cheese. 
And frequrntly I would get a 4 piece spicy, and even though it was a chain, it was a local chain with massive quality control. 
(and yes, odds are those years are most likely why over the past 3 years I've lost 250 pounds!.... Moderation kids!)

Over the years, the chain was sold off, the original owner died, and Popeye's became more hit and miss, especially the further you got away from the south.

Heck, you get your hopes up just to see a Popeye's!
usually the stand alone's are better, and the ones attached to Gas stations are hideous.

  
I've tried a few in the Phoenix area, And have been generally unimpressed. Not horrible, but just... a very thin flavorless crust.

So it was with trepedation that I went into this location, a drive through, attatched to a gas station.
I went for a box of chichen w/biscuits. and I can say it was the best I've had in the city so far.
The man at the window was friendly, the chicken was fresh, good, solid breading. With enough heat to give a nice depth of flavor, cutting a bit deeper than other chains would dare... which is what Popyes is all about. (I'm used to some blazing hot chicken... not stupid mind you, just HOT.. this is not that, but a good flavor. With good moist flesh, and thick crunchy skin. And the meal made the travel home well.
One downside? I'm just not a fan of these biscuits, they werent old... but they were dry... and lack the lush, buttery flavor and texture that I love. These were more dense and hockypuckish than I prefer.

If your craving some Popeye's chicken... well, lets put it this way,,, I'll be driving 20 minutes out of my way to go here.
This is my first time... so Your Milage May Vary..

 
Sidenote, I'n no Church's Chicken fan, but I went to the one on Arizona Avenue... and I've got to say, thats some fine spicy chicken! And cheap! And a big box of fried okra makes The Bride very pleased indeed!",1
"The drive to the top is really fun, and the view is worth it.

I really enjoyed it here, but there's too much freakin broken glass on any of the trails down near the main shade/view structure that you should realy avoid it if you have your dogs with you and stick to the more wilderness areas.

30 other reviews = TLDR (i just learned that one, see how I'm applying) so I'd rather be brief and useful than wordy and redundant.

I did read Chuck R's review, and I have to say, I wish I knew more of the nooks and crannys that you do, but I can tell you that if you want to explore the Western reaches of the park, do so by starting in the center or east, and not to bother with approaching from the West side of the mountain range itself.  All you'll find out there is a bunch of paranoid, possesive property owners who didn't stop to think that if they chose to own a home on a ribbon of private land that surrounds public land and restricts the public from getting to their public land, then they'll have to endure a little bit of traffic from said public.  Here's a clue for any of those property owners, whether you're on South Mountain, Piestewa, wherever....the guy sneaking around is the one you call the cops on for being a suspicious trespasser, not the guy driving a family suv with 2 dogs in the back, who calls you from the street as he sees you in your driveway so he can ask directions on how to get to the park entrance so he doesn't have to bother you nice people in the residential neighborhood anymore driving around here.    ah, duh.",1
"Boyfriend and I went to try Lobby's after seeing the phenomenal reviews.  He got the famous Italian beef sandwich hot with cheese and I got the little veggie sandwich and an order of the chili cheese fries. He got his in a combo that came with a side of fries and a drink. The owner was there and took our order and he was suuuuuuuper nice.  He was really excited for new people to try his food.  

We went and grabbed a table and just as we sat down, a rush of people came in.  There must be a lot of regulars because he was greeting some by name. There must be something to this food for that many loyal customers. 

Not too long after we got our drinks, the food was ready. I decided to immediately dive into the chili cheese fries. The cheese was like the melty nacho kind (not spicy though) and the chili was actually kind of sweet. I wasn't the biggest fan of the chili. My boyfriend did like it and he doesn't usually like chili. I'd probably just get cheese or plain fries next time.  The little veggie sandwich was so tasty! It was lettuce, tomato and pickles (I didn't want onions) with their house sauce on a sesame seed bun.  I'd love to try a burger next time.

The boyfriend did like his sandwich except he didn't know it was going to be ""dipped"".  He doesn't like his sandwiches dipped, so if he were to get that again, he would request it dry.  The sandwich was hearty (I added a pic) and very filling. He kept stealing my chili cheese fries so I take it he liked those too. 

It was really bright and clean in there and the owner and the guy making the food were really cool.  I'd definitely come back. We both want to try the burgers next time. Although....the hot dog with all the stuff does look damn tasty too....",1
"This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix. I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =)

The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers.

The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend.

They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect.

They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit.

The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way.

If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about. Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing!

Cheers and keep up the good work at the place.

FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal. I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel.",1
This is like a little sanctuary on the West Side with a few amazing therapists. The LMTs are pretty different from each other so ask some questions before you book. It is so awesome to walk in and be addressed by name and with a smile. The owner is seriously the nicest lady I've seen running a business in a long time.,1
Returned Sunday afternoon and was  pleasantly suprised. Happy Hour is 7 days a week 3-7 pm   ; )    I recieved great service at the bar which was friendly fast and efficient(Janessa) .I ordered couple of drafts and wings with good happy hour pricing! I will be back!,0
"We were in town for the weekend and I had a cigar at this lounge.  The cigar prices are reasonable and I didnt mind paying $9 for a La Gloria Wavelle.  Service was good and the atmosphere was nice and chill.  My Wife doesnt smoke cigars and the air circulation was good, no lingering smoke.  We met some nice people and the lounge singers were a plus.  We will come back next time we visit, I wish we had something like this in LA.",1
"I have used The Parking Spot twice now, and am a registered card carrying member...lol. I have coworkers who use one of the other economy places across the street, but they don't get covered parking and I don't remember them being offered a complimentary news paper on entry and nice cool water when leaving. I get a government discount with ID and you can usually find a coupon online. Not to mention the prompt pick up. They are behind my vehicle ready for me and my luggage even before I am out of my car. There have been times when we wait for a few more people before we go to the airport, but never more than 10 or so min. I love not having to weave my way through the airport construction or get lost or delayed trying to park at the airport. 
When getting picked up the most I have had to wait was about 20 min. And as I was about ready to call, they showed up. Don't loose your ticket. I have seen others who have and it makes it really tough. You can pretty much expect to be the drivers last drop off, unless you remember where it is or see your car as others are getting dropped off. 

The entrance is just W. of 40th St. and can only be accessed when heading W. bound on Washington due to the light rail. But the website has some good directions as well.",1
I contacted the owner based on his comment regarding my review and he never contacted me back.  Hmmm...,0
Every item that I tried was amazing. Owner made it a pleasant environment and he had a terrific voice. A must try in Central Phoenix.,1
"Back in August we went on a Sat night ..we got our 'skate on' good !
 8 bucks total ( But i have my own skates) 2 dollar skate rental ( i think) 

Great Dj was spinning classics ..i love roller -disco .totally took me back to my disco days ..also played a great mix of music in general .

it was super fun.
place needs some sprucing up ...but it wouldn't stop me from returning ,especially for some old school fun.",1
"Roka Akor Scottsdale is an extension of the celebrated Roka in London.
I attended the opening night and a follow up for lunch the following day. Overall, I was impressed with the offerings of fresh sushi, and robata grilled tidbits. The dish that really won me over was crab hot pot and the creamy rice was absolutely zoftik.
I drank many fresh sochu  infused cocktails, and crushed three bottles of sake with skilled Kikisake-shi, Sayaka Watanabe. This Japanese sake sommelier is London-based and the zuma-roka group sake trainer. They do have a fantastic sake selection. Easily the best in Scottsdale. She loved my sake brand I created with Midorikawa called Green River, and my low alcohol brand sake, Koide, as well.
They also have a great Italian Sommelier named Alessandro Marchesan, who is also based out of London. Too bad they are only loaner personnel from HQ in London.
The room is clean and beautiful with post modern Asian inspired lines. The staff is eager and young, but quite unskilled in refined service.  I am sure that will be a long cycle for the Roka management to fix. I have a dear friend who dined there on her birthday. She told me the service was ""shockingly bad."" She then reiterated that is was,  ""so bad that it was entertainingly bad!"" The food great and hopefully the service will match soon. Kanpai, Roka..kudos on your sake program.",1
"I'll be honest--this place is good for Americans... but not good enough for Chinese people.  The waiters were sort of rude to us, despite our being able to speak their language.

Furthermore.. what kind of authentic Chinese restaurant serves dinner out of plates? Blasphemy! Our table to had to go out of our way to get bowls! I'm surprised they had chopsticks.

Otherwise, their mock  food was salty and pasty, perfect for Americans in search of a good Orange Chicken replacement.  Wait.. salty and pasty? It's supposed to be a (insert meat type) dish, consisting of subtle flavors and intense chili pepper action.

Neeext...",0
"Treachery! Seek it out:

Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.

P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a ""gourmet"" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. 

Once you've paid nearly $14 for their ""orange peel chicken"", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.

Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.

Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's ""i"" so that it would ""fit on the signs better,"" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great ""American Chinese"" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of ""wok charred beef"", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.

The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:

'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. ""Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,"" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. ""It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing."" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'

Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway.",0
"This review is for the take-out window at the original Red Devil restaurant. I grew up in this neighborhood and have come here since I was a wee lass. I remember begging my mom to get out of the car so I could stand in front of the pick-up window and ""help"" her carry the pizza to the car. 

I still come here because the pizza is amazing, they always have a large cheese & wings combo on special, they make their own super-chunkily-creamy-delicious bleu cheese dressing and the guys who work at the pick-up window are super-sweet (even when it's blazing hot outside, and inside, near the ovens). Sure, you have to remember a random number they give you at a moment where you'll never be able to find a pen or something to write with in order to pick up your order (like Carolina's), but it's still my favorite pizza complete with a chewy, delicious crust. Enjoy.",1

"Great movie theater----staff so friendly!!!    If you love movies and comfy, clean theaters at reasonable price, check it out!!!!    Parking so easy and close as well.",1
"PCG is the restaurant by which I judge all others. PCG is totally dependable, always excellent. Service is always good, food excellent. i have eaten here probably 20 times and have never had a bad meal. 

Although the food is not ""challenging"" in that there are no weird flavors or textures, if you want a great nouvelle American meal for a reasonable amount of money, you need look no farther than here.",1
"I have been a ""regular"" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... 

The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The ""massage"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back.",0
"Warning, don't get deterred that there aren't any seats for you when you walk in... that's a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces.  I waited for about 15 minutes for a table to free up, and I'm glad I did.  It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot.  I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies.  The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper (just the way I like it), the noodles were thick and hearty, and the portion was substantial.  The pork pies (3) were like a flattened pot sticker that had been pan-fried on both sides, Yum!

Definitely, a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a home-cooked meal. I can't wait to go back!",1
"NOOOO!!! 
Don't think about it!!!!

Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks. The morons tore up the interior of my car, and damaged a speaker cover. 

I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice, they finally did, and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner. They never fixed the interior trim.

They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak, and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car, ruining the windshield wiper covers, and DOUSING my tweeter in water. I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a ""manager"" because he just had hip surgery (why is this my fault?!) and couldnt come until a week out!

Whatever incentives they offer are not worth the TERRIBLE craftsmanship and poor service. 
I am exploring my options with a lawyer, and have reported them to BBB.",0
"One of my lunchtime favorites -- a great bar menu under $10 (steak, shrimp, Italian sausage, etc) with good quality food and prompt service. 

Fun place to have drinks at happy hour. Plus, they have a nice traditional dining room for dinner. 

The bar area is always DARK (how it should be).",1
"We stayed at the Sheraton downtown and Matt's was a short walk.  Definitely worth the walk, and it helped to justify eating such a large breakfast.  There is probably something there that is not very good, but we did not find it.  When you get there, make sure you check in with the person running the register",1
"This is a car wash that I would highly recommend. They do a great job, and pay attention to the details. It costs a little more at Hot Shots, but it's worth it. It takes a bit more time, too- but worth it. The main reason I would recommend this place- they do an outstanding job and are consistent every time.",1
"Sometimes it's difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet , but every time I go to Pomegranate's I leave more than satisfied.   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful, although very busy during the lunch rush. I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.  This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.  Everything is so yummy you won't know it is good for you!",1
"I am new to Jamba, however i am surprised at the AMAZING customer service that this store dishes out. One of the workers there has always noticed me as a regular customer. He has a stellar personality, gave me a 20% off card and sometimes has my order ready by the time i finish paying the cashier. He's always very bright and smiling or laughing with his co-workers, I believe his name is Christian. He suggested a banana oatmeal with peanut butter the other morning and i have to say that it has been the most incredible oatmeal i have ever had!!! (You must try this) At times i visit the store twice a day simply because i cannot get enough Jamba Juice!!",1
"The Original Burrito Co. is quickly becoming my favorite burrito place. The owner came to eat at the restaurant I work at and she told me to come by and try this place out and being a huge fan of Mexican food I had to go. The burritos are really huge and really well priced. I love the California burrito with Chicken, add guacamole. The chicken is so moist and tender. I have tried the carne asada as well, but when I got it it was full of cilantro and jalapenos, which were just overbearing, but I'm thinking it could have been a bad day and will have to try it again. Downside for me would be that the salsa is not spicy at all. It tastes very good, but I am a huge fan of spicy, especially on Mexican food, and its a bummer for me when a place does not offer a very spicy salsa.",1
"WOW!!! A real European bakery!  This was awesome, after having lunch next door at La Buona Pasta we took home some kalachi's and walnut roll home for later.  The cakes are varied and everything looks buttery good and sweet.  Having grown up near a Swedish bakery it kind of remind me of that--donuts, cakes, cheesecakes, breads and other European specialties.  The shop is also set up with a small section of Polish-centric groceries.  mmmm maybe I will have to learn to cook some Polish dishes.  Next special occasion my cake is coming from there.  :-)

"We go to Fresh Wasabi a lot and usually it's the same thing...the service is not the fastest on the planet, but when you are there with good company you hardly notice. Their sushi is amazing and they have a perfectly priced menu. Love it!",1
I had great service and the Red Curry Chicken was wonderful. I only wish the dish wad a little warmer serving temperature. The Thia iced tea was fantastic.,1
"This has to be the best Thai food around. I have tried a few other places, but none are as authentic and delicious as Swaddee. We are now regulars and have never been disappointed.",1
"This place is a gem. The food is amazing. It's cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town.

Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!

I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.

The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!",1
"This would typically be a 3 star review, but it gets another star for the following:

* Great air conditioning
* Arizona's only Neiman Marcus
* Hilarious people watching
* Great happy hour haunts in the basement
* Everyone here has a better tan than I do  

Scottsdale Fashion Square is large and in charge and is definitely a sprawling spectacle to see at least once.   There's no denying that it's a local institution -- even if the store mix is a bit too pricey and exclusive for some.",1
"Went back to AB a few weekends ago, again for brunch, with a large group.  I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick.",1
"We had read good things about Over Easy, and were excited to try it out. We went a few days after Christmas, and were horribly disappointed.

When we walked in, we were seated by one server. Then, a few minutes later, another host came up to us and asked why we stole a table and did we not understand how seating works? We were quite confused and offended, as we were seated properly and had done nothing wrong.

Then, once we ordered, we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Finally, we asked about it, and then it was out within a few minutes. They had completely lost our order.

When our food arrived, one dish (the Over Easy -- toasted brioche with spinach & an egg) was absolutely inedible. The brioche was so burnt that we could barely cut it, as was the bacon. The fried egg was very undercooked, even though we requested it completely cooked through. I was honestly shocked the server brought us the dish without saying anything, since it was clearly burnt.

The other 2 dishes (banana & pecan french toast, and the Loretta sandwich) were just alright -- certainly nothing to rave about. And, the 3 of us ended up splitting these 2 dishes, since the other dish was awful. We ended up leaving early because we were all so disappointed. At which point, our server asked if we'd like a box for our uneaten burnt brioche. It would have been much more appropriate for her to ask if there was something wrong with it, since it was obviously not eaten.

Anyway, I'm not sure if we just caught them on a bad day, but I would never go back again or recommend Over Easy to anyone else.",0
"Absolutely LOVE the ambiance - very romantic with the brick and stone and walls of wine. The fireplace and comfy seating make it very intimate. In my opinion, the best time to come here is for brunch. Yes, even on a Sunday nursing a hangover, the food, drink and decor can't be beat. Very reasonably priced mimosas and bloody's as well as some of the best breakfast items you could ask. My fave is the eggs benedict with thier Mexican twist - the carne adovada is also amazing and very satisfying. No skimping on the meat here, and it's not drowning in sauce - I have yet to finish a full plate of anything. Thier potatoes even get my mouth watering.  

Service was great the last time we went, but the first time we had to go up to the bar to remind the gal we were there. After that she was more than attentive and the food more than made up for it. I could linger here for hours and get in some serious trouble! 

Have not been to the downstairs area or had any other meal here, but can't wait to go back!!!",1
"I actually love the Waterfront Grill. I have never been there during bar hours, so it might not be a good later in the evening, but I usually go around 5-7 for dinner and the food has always been excellent. I usually get the buffalo chicken wrap, but sometimes I go with the fish tacos. Both are excellent and the service is great (because usually my and my friend are the only ones in there - I often wonders how it stays open). The cookie desert is awesome! It is like the Piezooki and Oregano's. Just as good.",1
"Delux is always really good, fresh, and it's a clean place too! I love the beet salad with chicken added. It's delish! My man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries. Love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup, Ah-mazing!",1
Love this location at Gainey Ranch! Great food consistently!,1
"Let's see...what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium? Well, $9.50 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and that's not a surprise (pun intended) considering you're attending a sporting event...even spring training. 

But as someone who does not living in Arizona, and as someone who doesn't go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much, people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here. Look, you're lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard. If I could, I'd live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year. 

I attended my first spring training game on March 12th, 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants (my favorite team). Our seats (Sec. 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees). I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures). The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel you're at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players. The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean. 

Arriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this. The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful. I didn't have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long. The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!). 

I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family. Oh, Giants won 2-1! Go Giants!!!",1
"This bar is ok to hang out at. I think its sort of frumpy. The drinks are fine, I've never eaten there.  They have PBR there. 

Lots of local people mostly regulars. Anyone can go there an fit in there.  I have been a few times but it's not a place I spend a lot of time.",0
"No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars, but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass. During school hours, this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants. Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout. Losers.",0
"Tried this place for weekday lunch.  We arrived before noon and good thing since they have a big lunch crowd.  (not to worry, plenty of parking in back and seating outside w/ misters)  Kudos to Aric and Monica for stopping by our table several times to make sure service was great or they fixed it.  We started with the Bruchetta, which was piled high.  The we had the Smokey (arugula & smoked prosciutto) and the Marg pizzas. Almost had the Pabst on tap, but went for the Dunkel since its harder to find.  As if the food wasn't enough, the decor and ambiance was over the top.  The herb garden as you walk in and the bar with the salon chairs was a nice touch. 

Can't wait to go back.",1
Crust is chewy.  Pizza is below-average.  Nice owner though.,0
The Chorizo gravy can be habit forming.,1
"I couldn't rate this place until my 2nd go around only because my first time was take-out.  That being said, I did get the same thing both times and am pretty sure I can say I enjoy their Pulled Pork portion and would get it again.  It is moist, soft, and flavorful all on its own, but I do enjoy drizzling some Sissy sauce on it.  I've also had their corn-on-the-cob twice and found it super plain and not even sweet or enjoyable.. totally blah for me with the corn.  They use real butter, though, so if I liked their corn, I'd be a fan of that.  I'll stick to the pulled pork.

On to their BBQ sauce: I am not a big fan of a few things, mainly how they serve the sauce, which is in a large diameter *glass* bottle with a bottle pourer (the kind bartenders used to control the flow of alcohol when pouring)... no bueno. It took me a long while to get a quarter size sauce on to my pork and it was just frustrating.. and the glass makes it non-squeezable.. and the huge bottle makes it heavy to hold while you're waiting for gravity to help you get that little dab of sauce out and on to your meat... yeahhh, it was that annoying.  Here's an idea: make your sauce fresh and then put it in big ass jars than we can either portion out ourselves (like Joe's Real BBQ) or put it in squeezable bottles (like Famous Dave's)... *anything* but giant glass bottles with pourer restrictors on... puhleeeeze!

Their staff is very friendly, the ambiance is very relaxed and totally casual, pic-nic-style seating and, of course, country.  They have a great concept of huge coolers of booze (beer) where you can pick out your beer and put it in a bucket.. they also have sody-pop and sweet tea.  

Country music on the speakers.... yummy pulled pork... buckets of cold beer... pic-nic seating.. that's what I enjoyed.",1
"Monday and Tuesday night after 8pm, you can get any bottle of wine and a whole board of bruschetta for $20. It's a steal, and a delicious one at that.",1
"I went in at 8 on a Thursday night, and the place was pretty empty except for a family of 4 eating.  The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.  The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread, but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears, and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.  When I have tailgate this year, Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.  Also, my meal only ran me about $8.50 and it was very filling and worth every penny.",1
"I was there last week with my sisters and while we ordered our steaks cooked medium, all of them came out well done. Kind of disappointed, but oh well.

So last night my fiance and I had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, so we headed over. When I ordered my steak cooked medium, I asked her to make a point of it when she put the order in because of the issue last week.

When our food came out, she asked me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked the way I wanted. I did and, while it was a bit more medium-well than medium, I was hungry and it looked good, so I gave it the go ahead and we started our meal. It really was a good steak.

When our waitress came out again, she double checked that my steak was cooked correctly. I assured her it was fine. A few minutes later a manager came out and apologized for my steak being over done and offered to replace it. I assured him it was maybe a little overdone, but it was good and I was happy with my meal. They were being very nice and showing some great customer service, though a little overzealous. :)

When the bill came, they had made my steak the free one for the coupon, even though mine was the more expensive of the two meals we ordered.

Great customer service, and very good food.",1
Thank you so much for the good reviews. I went here for a business meeting 8-13-2010. I ate soo much I hurt myself. Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry. The staff was excellent and very kind. I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone. ;),1
"I've been going here many years.

The food is always very, very good. Soups are fantastic, sandwiches are hearty and flavorful, and the service is excellent. Prices are reasonable and the food quality and quantity is probably the best bang for the $ you'll get in a place like this, anywhere I've been - and I travel a lot.

I really cannot think of a single thing I can fault this place for.",1
"Sometimes I really wish I could live in Scottsdale. I met up with two girlfriends there and we had a great time! This visit was a solid 3-4. We went in to take advantage of their happy hour (if you don't the prices seem wayyyy to steep for me). Anyway, if you take advantage of their happy hour you must sit either in the outside patio or the lounge. Now the outdoor patio was beautiful! Prettiest outdoor seating I have seen ever. But not when it is 104 out. (and there are no misters). Why did we sit outside do you ask? Because the bar area (which is tiny) filled up super fast (duh. its yummy!) The indoor ambiance is beautiful. (a little dark) The most awesome lights ever are in there. The service was good and the location is nice (right next to the free parking too!)

I tried the featured white wine, and whatever it was (sorry I forgot) was good! My friend tried the sangria, but I was not a fan. Weird flavor compared to most sangrias that I can't describe.

 Now onto the food. People who raved about the flatbread pizzas...I have no idea what you are talking about.  I had the margharita and it was just not good. Soggy and flavorless. The hummus was very yummy. Needed more pita with it. Now onto the star of the show: the bruschetta. The vine ripe tomato is yummy. The apple caponata is just as yummier, and the prosciutto and fig was also excellent! Ohhhh so yummy! This is the place to get bruscetta and wine after a long day.",0
"i'd rather go to amado's!

the only thing that's good here is the bean dip, and i'm only saying that so that i have something nice to say.",0
"I saw this company on 2 Fix It and thought i'd give them a try. I was charged $320.00 to replace a day/night photo sensor for our front lights. Here's the breakdown...

$49.00 service call
$89.00 diagnostic fee
$199.00 no fuss price to replace the sensor (#3 on their Straightforward Pricing)

They replaced the small recessed photo sensor with one that extrudes from the side of the house. Clearly it is not the same part. WTH?!

I phoned Mr Sparky to log my complaint - they were very nice. As of now, the owner of the franchise will be calling me to discuss my options. I'll post an update on the results.

I just believe that if you are paying over $300.00 for a little photo light sensor, you should get a similar part in return. Unbelievable.

To Fix It certainly didn't do their research on this company.",0
"I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.

Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.

Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food.",1
"Just have to rave about Becca and Todd's Zoo tour on a Segway. It was the highlight of our trip to Scottsdale.  I had never been on a Segway before but it was so easy and Becca taught me all the tricks.  We never would have visited the Phoenix Zoo if it was not for the Segway tour.  It was fun, easy and worth every penny.",1
"Every culture has their comfort soup.  American's have chicken noodle, Mexican's have menudo and Vietnamese have pho.  I must have been Vietnamese in a past life. 

Pho is the national dish of Vietnam and a staple at any Vietnamese restaurant and Pho Avina has some of the best pho around.  Let me warn you - this isn't an appetizer, this is a meal.  A big, steaming bowl of soup served with your choice of meat and noodles in a savory, almost sweet, broth.  The pho is served with a large plate of fresh basil, cilantro and bean sprouts; the cilantro complimented the soup nicely.  I chose the chicken and shrimp and was pleasantly surprised with large shrimp and big chunks of all white chicken. 

My eyes were bigger than my stomach, so I also ordered the deluxe vermicelli salad.  A salad of noodles, veggies, beef, chicken, shrimp, eggroll, sweet potato cake and fish sauce - toss together and enjoy.  I had it boxed up, but did nibble on a few items and the sweet potato cake is out of this world good. 

I had come for the banh mi at the recommendation of a previous yelper.  They only serve the sandwiches Monday-Friday from 11-3; I had just missed them.  Darn.  I will definitely be back to try the banh mi and a boba, there were soooo many delicious flavors to choose from except for the fresh durian - icky, icky, icky.",1
"The best tacos in the city, amazing veggies, and indescribably great salsas. The tacos are like tapas, so you need to order two or three, but they are reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff with great art to view while waiting for your order.",1
"This Starbucks is located on a busy street, on a busy corner in Tempe. There are plenty of places to sit outside but who wants to in AZ in the summer right?

The weekend we were there, the women's restroom had plugged up in a an ugly way but no worries, I tend ot use either one if I have to go so I popped into the men's.

The place was clean (besides the toilet) very cool and even better, the staff was very cool. It's nice to get your regular drink at a Starbucks and it tastes as good as it does at your fave Starbucks in San Diego...thanks ladies!",1
"Yummy, creative sandwiches!  Good prices.  Highly recommended.

Service is generally a bit of an issue, so if you are one of the prissy eaters who doesn't understand that serving can be tough, you'll probably get your panties in a wad.",1
"First time at YC's, had been to other Mongolian BBQ style places, none as ""upscale"" as this. Most of the Mongo places I've been are in the mall fast food court, or in a small strip mall. This place made us go WOW as to how big it was and all the food you get for about $11 a person for dinner.

To go boxes are 50 cents, super reasonable considering you can really cram a lot of food into your bowl to get cooked. I was actually shocked that they suggested you pack the food into your bowl to get more space! Staff was friendly and even helped us out with mixing the sauces.

This place is super close to our house and we will definitely be back frequently.",1
"Sitting at the counter at FnB is an experience that should be had, period. Our reservations by default was later on in the evening, but also turned out to be quite fortuitous. Not only were we able to see chefs Badman and Curry in action, but also saw them turn down the kitchen towards the end of the night. It is a display that even the most advent epicurean is not often exposed to. There are no doors or walls to hide behind. Everything that you eventually place in your mouth is out in the open and also in the way it is prepared - from the raw, to the stove, to the plate. 

Impressive was also how fluid the kitchen moved with only the two chefs preparing dishes. Chef Curry preparing the appetizers, fish and fowl; while Chef Badman shoveled coal onto a grill and simultaneously manning it to ensure rib-eyes were cooked to order. 

The ambiance was the type you'd expect when invited into another's kitchen, and the food tasted as if given the same attention. So to the service. Our waitress, Chantelle was nice about explaining everything to us after hearing that it was our first time there. When she found out we had moved just a few months ago, she was kind enough to write down her restaurant recommendations for us too. 

Will definitely be back to try other items off their ever-evolving menu. Reservation for two please. Yes its okay if its at the counter and yes, its fine if its late.",1
"I'm not one for hyperbole, but this may have been

THE  BEST      MEAL      OF   MY       LIFE!!!!

I'd like to hold an awards show and give out lifetime achievement trophies to the following individuals:

1.  To the chef, who exceeded my expectations again and again. The Stetson salad, wild boar meatballs, and Korean-style BBQ short ribs (and that killer side of au-gratin brussel sprouts) and you, sir, have won my heart and my stomach.  I want to fill a swimming pool with that BBQ sauce!

2.  To our server, Richard.  Your genuine excitement for the food was a nice change from past servers reluctant to give a real recommendation.  You were cordial and professional and made sure we enjoyed our time with you.  I don't know, I may name my unborn child after you in tribute.

3.  To the pastry chef, Country.  Your bread pudding was exceptional, but what a surprise, your ice creams were downright dreamy!  The scoop of brown butter ice cream took my tastebuds on a field trip through chilled fields of chocolate truffles.

Thank you thank you for a wonderful birthday dinner!",1
"This is a good place to go when you're hungry, but don't want the ""blah"" weighed-down yucky, greasy feeling.  I always order the greek pita, well, because I'm a feta fan! Yes, a large amount of the menu has feta, so if you don't like it, you may want to rethink coming here.  The rice pilaf is delicious, I also love the fruit bowls (not a fan of the pasta salad).  Chicken salad is good, but I think it needs some salt & pepper personally. Yaya's chocolate cake is really yummy! All in all, I enjoy this place!",1
"I've been a Char's patron since before we were legal to be in there (many years ago, previous owners). It has always been a lively place with a diverse crowd of aging black hep-cats, college students, bikers, tweakers, college students, heavy middle aged white women who love black men, the ocassional tranny and Hispanic couples on dates with a sprinkling of occasional stippers/hookers. In other words - everything you would want to make a blues bar entertaining and just seedy enough to be interesting. 

They are one of the only places in Central Phoenix with live music almost every night of the week and the cover, if any, is typically only a couple of bucks. The place is small and dark and crowded, like a blues bar in an old converted house should be. Talent varies by night but anytime you go it's passable. Personal favorites are lady J and Bam Bam and any combination thereof, which is what you usually get any way. Wander in on a random Monday night and 11:30 and you will find music, cruising, and drinks waiting. There is a small enclosed patio up front for smoking, about 16 spaces in their lot and street parking available on the residential street, but watch the signs and don't block driveways. You can also cross 7th Ave, but be careful dodging cars. The neighborhood looks scarier than it is so don't be alarmed by a transient or two wandering down the street but they don't bite unless you pay extra. Close to lite rail as well in case sneaker pimps want to try to cross over from Central, but hopefully they won't.",1
Got a padi and the tech stopped for a while to eat. then i got a new tech to finish my pedi. my total was different than the quoted price. when paying my total was $25 i hanede them a $50 and they cashier tried to keep all the change for a tip. he refused to give me my change until i told him that is not gon to happen. My feet were so dry afterwards. I DO NOT recommend them,0
"This was definitely the best meal of this year's holiday trip....

The Kale Caesar! is a very creative interpretation of the timeless classic.  We loved the melted Scamorza cheese.  

I had the Applewood Smoked Duck for my entree, accompanied by a glass of the Siduri pinot from Willamette.  The wine was perfect with the cherry sauce, besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck.  A glass of Siduri for $12 is a great deal, too.  I loved the way the duck was prepared, too, and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can, either.

My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative (and delicious) interpretation of sangria.  Roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet corn are part of the presentation.  

Dessert was the decadent Dream Pudding Jar.  We always get excited about an original dessert dish, and this one did not disappoint.

Service was top notch all the way, also.",1
"MMMMM. Let me break it down for you...when you can hear staff in the kitchen saying ""oh wow, that looks amazing"" as plates are coming up in the window, you're in for a treat. I mean the fact that they see these dishes time and time again and are still excited by them....! Then flash forward to the next day and if you're heating up second lunch (I like to eat) in the office micro and employees comment on the delicious smells, yeah you're doing a-ok! I was solo this time because Gabi M was home with baby Mess and I didn't think to call Jarred (sorry bud!). Eating alone certainly wasn't as much fun but it was delicious. Eggplant is a must. You just HAVE TO get it, done. In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles, veggies, basil, and a spicy/sweet sauce. SO tasty. The portions are enormous, so don't balk at the prices. Grab two entrees, share with the group, take home leftovers...that simple ;).

Know Before You Go:  I'm only in Scottsdale one every other month and Tottie still remembers me when I come in, and that rocks! Big fan.",1
"Went here one night with a group of friends. This place is pink, crowded, and really not that impressive. I ordered some sorbet and it was bland - that in itself is an accomplishment - bland sorbet.  The 50's style booth seats were very uncomfortable (maybe to discourage staying long?) and the tables were the wrong height for eating. I had to strain to get above face level of my food (and i'm a normal sized woman) It was also very very (very) loud in here.

I'll avoid going here again. The quality of the product was just too poor - I'd rather hit up a Whole Foods and get some good sorbet without the discomfort and echoing nosie.",0
"Tough to rank this place...   it is a retirement community first off.   The club house is awesome.   Pool is salt water and heated.   Courses are nice, little bit of a challenge but basically flat.   The putt putt course is very challenging and really cool.    I'm not impressed at all with the club food and suggest staying away from the roast beef.   It seemed fake.",1
"i think reviews for this place are based on happy hour experiences. the food was SHOCKINGLY hot and fast out the kitchen. methinks there's some heavy microwave usage going on. the interior of the restaurant is and dark and fancy, but the food is mediocre and overpriced.  in fact, the roaring fork became both a barometer and a joke for the remainder of our visit in scottsdale.

if you want an equally priced meal with amazing food, yelp something else closer to oldtown (might i suggest something from the Baratin/FnB empire)?",0
"SALSA BAR RAID!  that is exactly why I do when I am at this place. The salsa bar is the main attraction for me. There are many great salsa options, plus fresh cilantro and peppers. Some of the salsas are good enough to be eaten straight, like the mango salsa, it makes a good desert.

The menu for this place is somewhat somewhat limited t mostly burritos and tacos. Recently the menu was revised and the cheaper items were removed and more expensive ones were added in their place.

Every meal comes with a small side of chips, which adds even more use to the salsa bar. The grilled green onion that used to come with each meal is gone and missed.",0
Their Alfredo the Dark is probably the best pasta dish in Phx. And then there's the Pazookie...,1
"-Inexpensive produce.

-Fresh sausage and other meats.

-$2.99 freshly made to order sanwiches.

-Decent prices, cheaper than Whole Foods.

-Parking is convenient.

-Employees in the produce dept not so friendly. 

-Cashiers are usually friendly.",1
"I now consider myself an Arizonian. If you drive a lot on the 101 or 51 like I do, you'll get your fair share of chips on your windshield. You'll also have to replace a windshield like I had to do just recently. Apparently, chips and cracking windshields  is common in Arizona. In fact, I seem to recall my insurance agent telling me that insurance companies must provide this coverage in Arizona.

I had a chip repaired about a year ago near the very bottom of the windshield. Just recently a small, very fine crack started traveling north on the windshield from the repaired chip (a different vendor repaired the chip). I called these guys over to my house and they said it was too long to fix, so they replaced the whole windshield the next day.

What great service, they come out to your residence or place of business to repair or replace your windshield.",1
"Sushi and birthdays go hand-in-hand. I returned to Phoenix just in time to hang out with my friends for my birthday and they took me here. This place gets packed during happy hour for their half-priced sushi rolls and great drink specials. 

Stingray is a beautiful restaurant in a high-class location. The patios are spacious and there is a lot of seating indoors too. 

The sushi is well made and I will return...however, during happy hour. The prices jump up and the place gets empty once happy hour is over.",1
"Shaved noodles, shaved noodles, shaved noodles!  Am I too butt lazy if I only go for shaved noodles?  The dish ordered with the handpulled meant I had to hold chopsticks high into the air trying to separate a portion of noodles out onto our plates.  Not bad but wasn't special... but the shaved noodles, loved the chewy texture.  I unashamedly used my baby godson as an excuse to get a mini noodle pulling show at the window.

I'm going to work my way thru the fresh fruit juice offerings...  I used to drink that daily while working as an expat in HK.  Speaking of which, the bathrooms are sooooo HK grand (Amy L, you and I think alike!)...

Overall the stir fried dishes were a bit greasy and the flavors decent, but the draw here is the shaved noodles (can I plug this anymore?!) and the fresh fruit juice.",0
"Bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it.  We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. 

After an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The ""quinoa crust"" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.

We also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made ""extra spicy"" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.",0
"I don't think my husband will let me rate it anything less than 5 stars... 

Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot, we parked at neighboring house for 5 bucks.  Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn... People were very friendly.  My hubby met some folks from Dixon, IL the day before and they came by to say Hi... and of course, watching the Cubbies - can't beat that!!!",1
"I loved this place! A bit pricey, but excellent quality.

Been here twice and haven't had anything we didn't like. The meat is great quality and they'll cook it how you desire as opposed to places that won't cook something below medium well.

Great toppings for burgers, fries and shakes. Although everything is so big and filling I certainly can't have all that in one trip!

Definitely a decadent tasty treat.",1
"Whole Foods is awesome.  They have a huge selection of organic and vegetarian items and a deli/bakery area with tables for a quick lunch or dinner.

If you eat any of the Morningstar Farms products, this is a good place to get them.  Although you won't find them as cheap here as other places, they do have a really big selection.

This is also a good place to get vitamins or any alternative health products.",1
As much as you don't want to like Wally World...it is what it is...crazy!!,0
"I can say that I used to love the place. Not so much any longer. 

Went over there this past Sunday at 7pm. Crowded, but still room to sit 6 of us. Here are a few simple notes to sum up the evening.

Waitress was on something. She was walking, but out of it. Forgot our order twice, and both times could not remember even taking them. Very bizarre. 
Girl next table fell over and out of her chair. No one really even seemed to notice, maybe that happens often here now. 
Place looks tired, worn out, especially the fabric on the chairs and booths outside. If you squint, you can see the old Vig, when it seemed spotless, and shiny. Now a bit tattered, along with the staff. 

If you are over 28, then I would have to say you might feel old in here. Reminds me of a spring break crowd being filmed by an MTV crew in Cabo. Very young, very drunk.",0
"I still have no idea what this place is.  I only know that my dog needed some pills to treat his valley fever and for some reason the vet didn't carry them so I was sent here.

The whole process is pretty painless and I think their drugs are priced reasonably.  They will also hand deliver the medication the same day if you ask nicely.

Pro Tip:  When you call, don't hang up right away when you get the recorded message.  When you stay on the line it will begin to ring again and someone may answer.  I thought the recorded message was an answering machine and hung up prematurely a few times.  Also, sometimes the line just rings and rings and rings.  Be patient and someone will probably pick up.",1
"Now that this place is under new management it's gotten better.  i went once before and it was kind of nasty, now it's cleaner and has a better selection.

Its hard to find  edible chinese food in Phoenix, this one is one of the better ones now.  I think it's renamed Fuji Buffet.  It even had a sushi bar (not a sushi eater, but it had one) and everything was as fresh as can be expected. Large shrimp and chicken selection, and pizza and things for the kiddos.

Stay away from the desserts tho', not so great.",0
"Food was pretty good but my biggest issue was with the service. We made a reservation and still had to wait an hour. Isn't the whole point of a reservation...so you don't have to wait an hour? One of the three hostess, tried to help at the end of the wait but by then all we waited was to eat/drink. All in all, I enjoyed my chicken and bbq ribs but would not go back.",0
Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.,1
"YUMMMMMM!!!! I was brought to this place by a friend and was so glad to find it! Very clean and unique casual setting. Staff were very friendly, food was hot, fresh and amazingly gooy...definately a 4+ napkin kind of meal. So happy to see they serve Chicken philly -steak as well as the usual philly cheese steak and sweet potatoe fries! Find out where this place is because it could be easily over looked and you would be missing out on some deeee-licous food. This place is a must try!",1
"This place is a hit or miss. Hence why I would rate it as average.  I've been here so many times for lunch because it's so close to work and because coworkers would suggest it.  I've had all the curries and every time the spiciness is different even though I ask for a 3.  Sometimes it's not spicy at all and sometimes it's so spicy that my mouth burns.  

I've had the eggplant with chicken, but the chicken isn't as moist and tender as I hoped meat would taste like. They chopped up the chicken in very small pieces and seemed overcooked.  I would stick with the different types of curries (red, green, yellow) though.  It's safer.  The curry sauce would seep into the meat and make it more tender. The curries can also be different textures.  I've had it where it's thick and creamy (the way I like it) or more watered down.  The lunch portions are pretty small, but I guess it's enough for a lunch meal.  

Beware Swaddee's if you're not too comfortable with spicy.  Just order a lower number and you can add more chili if it's not spicy enough for you.  I still would recommend this place and try your luck with the food here.  You may get lucky and have a great meal.",0
"Despite not being Federal employees in any way, Memorial Day seems to be a time when restaurateurs think they deserve a day off, leaving me with few actual lunch options and relegating me to the worst of the worst: Eating. In an AIRPORT RESTAURANT.

Turns out that Taberna wasn't actually as bad as all that - the bar is nice to spend a few hours waiting for your flight, and the titular Blue Burrito - despite not being blue in any way, shape or form - wasn't too bad by fast food standards, and quite plentiful for the $8 I spent on it. And if you don't like it, you can cover it with Cholula, close your eyes, and pretend you're eating somewhere better.",0
i love the $5 happy hours. all the dishes are a great value and delicious!,1
Best basic $12 in/exterior wash i got in a while. Didnt even have to tell them to wipe down anything.,1
"Canal has been a stop on many a ""bar tour"" through the Waterfront / Old Town area. The bar always has a good crowd in the evenings and the patio is fantastic on warm nights. With summer finally clearing out and it now being possible to sit outside during the daylight hours, we made our way to Canal for some late lunch / day drinking on a recent Sunday.

First off, what a great place to sit and people watch!  This was the first time we had ever ordered food at Canal, so we were interested to see if the cuisine lived up to the hip decor and vibe of the restaurant. The baby burgers (3 of them) were served up on an ""English High Tea"" tray. Great presentation, and the actual taste of those little guys didn't disappoint.....ahi tuna / fillet mignon / ground chicken. The fillet was my favorite. What can I say? I like red meat!

We also had the fish tacos.....delicious! A great experience, all around. We're definitely looking forward to getting back here for dinner soon.",1
"Decent bar food with all the servers dressed in Alice Cooper attire.  
I am being open-minded and starting this thing off with 5 stars.  

Minus one star for being a bit overpriced on the appetizer end.  I ordered onion rings at $8 per order.  Seriously, are 15 onion rings worth $8? 

Minus one star for not having any parking.  You have to park a couple of blocks away in the ghetto area to find a spot.  You will have 2-3 beggars asking you for change to and from your car.  There was a dude who wanted to wash my windows for money.  

Minus half a star for putting the gratuity on the bill and charging for it.  I hate that crap.  

Plus half a star for the waitresses who are dressed heavy metal-like wearing mid-riffs with the tramp stamp.  I always wanted to date chicks like that, but was ummm...to busy with umm....other chicks chasing me down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I just umm...you know, didnt have time for them at that point in my life.  

I better stop my review now.",0
"Love this place! Just went here and ordered the petite filet and lobster tail, everything is so good here. I also love the pork chop! My favorite dessert is the lava cake hot and yummy.",1
"I really wanted to fall madly in love with this place, I mean, a British themed pub in Heritage Square? So promising. 

As you walk in, the bartender is standing behind in an elaborate wooden bar structure. This made me think publican instead of bartender (as in ""Mate, I'll take a pint and d'ya have any rooms available?""), which is probably the idea. As there was nice selection of draught beers, we walked around to the bar to the right and ordered a couple of pints. I ordered a Boddingtons, my friend ordered a Stateside micro brew. (Would have been nice if they had Old Peculiar on tap, but you can't have everything.) 

Due to the combination of things cooking in the kitchen, it smelled a bit like my grandma's house. This prompted us to make a beeline for the patio decorated with super-heavy wood furniture. I assume this is to discourage thieves from selling their tables and chairs on the black market. Smart. The piped-in music selection that night was a bit off-putting, in fact, one of the other patrons commented on it as well. It appeared to be a satellite radio station that specialized in 80s hits like Wham! and Depeche Mode. I guess George Michael and David Gahan ARE British. Indeed! Wikipedia just informed me that ""Dave Gahan (born May 9, 1962 in Epping, Essex, England) is the baritone lead singer for the English electronic band Depeche Mode, and is also an accomplished solo artist."" Now I feel better. 

There are many cozy nooks in this place, so that would be a good thing if you wanted to have some one-on-one time. They were also playing football (soccer) on the flat screens, so should make some team scarf-wearing Brit ex-pats in the Valley very happy.

Will I be back to try the food? Probably at some point. But, for another round of drinks, I think I'll wait for a Friday or Saturday night when it's hopping.",0
"5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That, and its near the Trunk Space.",1
"This is a pretty chill spot for drinks & bar food.  We went on a Sunday night after a big meeting that was held at the Phoenix Convention Center.  They were able to accommodate a group of about 20 of us without any issues (not a whole lot of people there).  

Their quesadillas and curly fries are quite good and I could not help reaching for the nachos again and again, but definitely avoid their Caesar salad (I know, who orders salad at a bar anyway?!)",0
"OH this shop makes me want to lose a hip or something just to fit into their clothing!!  I found not one thing in larger sizes, but my friend, who's a size 8, found LOTS of awesome vintage clothes...including, yes ladies and gentlemen, a 70s JUMPSUIT!  I am drooling and green with envy, but alas, I couldn't find anything.  Go here if you're thin (or just want to torture yourself by staring at all the awesome clothes that won't fit you unless you chop off some body part you probably need).",0
"I am totally addicted to this place. Tons of flavors of smoothies, and perfectly cooked Boba. Green Tea, or even Vanilla Chi - so far all the flavors I've tried have been fantastic.",1
"As I promised myself, I'd go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and it's like ""wha? really? is this IRL?"" 

I'm a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, I'm not a fan of.",0
"I've been to Barrio twice now.  Simply put, I do not believe that it is worth the prices that they charge. The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.  

Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.  

I've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.

Because it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it).

The two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service.  The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied.  The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool.  I imagine that they all enjoy working there.

I don't really ever need to go back to Barrio, unless I'm craving a serious margarita served up by a cute hipster.  I'd go for a drink or two and then go elsewhere for dinner.",0
"E-Z Buffet is a Chinese buffet that recently opened in my neighborhood.  

It was about $10 for dinner .  The place had a bunch of tables so seating was easy.   You can also get take out.

They have a lot of food to choose from, typical Chinese fare plus sushi, fried chicken wings, roast beef, salad fixings, pudding & fruit.  They also had ice cream for desert, not soft serve but hard ice cream.  

I like the General Tso's Chicken, Scallion Pork and their freshly steamed green beans.  I loved their rocky road ice cream. 

The wait staff was prompt and friendly.  I really liked that.

This place is worth trying.  If you go please write a review.  I'd love to know what others think.",0
"Corporate... Juice... PIMPS!!! 
I lurve me some corporate pimp juice! I've been a fan of Jamba's juices for quite a few years... but over time, I had forgotten about the joys of Jamba until my sister (Reylynne W.) We went and I got something with oranges and strawberries in it... i unno what it had... but damnit it was good! :) Nice, clean and fresh, I loved every thick sip. :)",0
"I've been here twice, great decor, cute & really friendly staff, and lots of really nice people to shoot the bull with. I've heard the food is really good too, but haven't tried much of it yet. I did try the french fry basket, it was nice and huge, and the hot wings are good, they use Franks, so if you like reg hot, get the hot. Happy hour specials are a good value too. Will return often.",1
Best sushi in town.,1
"I usually do not complain about bad food but the fish and chips gave my wife a serious case of food poisoning.  So if some manager reads this please check out your fish supply or change the cooking oil.  She never gets sick and has been sick all day (December 29, 2012) from the meal eaten December 28, 2012.",0
"I needed to get away and Hyatt vacations was offering these rooms for a steal ($79 a night Xmas week!) so I decided to come here.  The grounds were absolutely beautiful.  Unfortunately they had a freak cold spell and I was unable to use the 10 pools, jacuzzi, waterslide, or any other outdoor facilities, but I did take a short walk around.  I also had a balcony looking out at the pools and the mountains, but unfortunately it was too cold to utilize that too.  The restaurants were too pricxey for me so I can't speak to those.  Parking is free at the hotel.  I did check out the Native American Education Center and thought that was a nice thing to have.  I never did make it to the spa unfortunately.  
Service was top notch: when I first arrived my key did not work and I stopped an engineer in the hall who got a new key sent up, and when I asked her where the ice machine was, she said I could call the bellman and he would bring some to me (I couldn't be that lazy, so I did go down the hall and get it myself).  The bathroom was stocked with Portico products (decent sized bottles) and had a ginormous shower with a rainfall head and a handheld jet.  I also appreciate the small light under the mirror which I could leave on at night rather than having to leave a larger light on.  There was a refrigerator in the room which I used to stock water and bubbly from the Safeway down the road (the hotel is very convenient to many restaurants and shops).  One of the best things was that the wake up call was a good old fashined person, not a machine, and she offered to call me back--gotta love a live snooze button! When I went to check out, the folio on the TV showed charges, so I called downstairs, explained I had prepaid the package, and the front desk people solved the issue very quickly to my satisfaction.  Also, they have machines by the front desk that allow you to check in and print your boarding pass.
My one complaint and why I did not give it a fifth star: charging for internet.  Seriously, in this day and age, that to me felt like it was nickling and diming the guests, many who pay a lot to stay at the resort.
For those who go to Scottsdale, I definitely recommend the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch (and check out the Hyatt Vacations website for some good deals).

UPDATE: I checked my cc bill three days later and they had double charged me after all, despite giving me a zeroed out receipt.  Poor form, Hyatt.  She credited back to me, but what if I hadn't noticed?",1
"Service was great, food was ok, restaurant was clean, but the price was more than it's worth.",0
"My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel. I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad.

Anywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good. We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go. As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.

I ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.

The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb! The Mac and cheese was super duper great.

In Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner. I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there.

BIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint!!",1
"I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's so nice to be able to eat here whenever it's chilly outside. Actually, allow me to be honest, I probably would eat here everyday but I settle for 1-2 times a week.

I get my Pho with extra meatballs and no onions and they make it perfect for me each time!!! The folks are awesome and no matter how busy it is everything come out SUPER fast! You know a girl loves to eat in a timely manner with my hectic schedule!

The Springrolls, the crab puffs the chicken fried rice all amazing too! For a good time time and warm feeling after a FANTASTIC meal this is the best come winter or AZ summer time:)",1
"Met for a business meeting, good happy hour menu, we had the flatbread which was great to share over our meeting with some of their house bread, which was excellent with the pesto.

The well whiskey was poured nicely and our server was nice.

Great for happy hour biz meetings on the waterfront, but only 3 tables in the bar, so you better get there early.",1
"Decent place for legit Chinese food with the usual fast service and decent prices. We were able to enjoy roasted duck, crispy pan fried noodles and honey walnut shrimp. All winners we thoroughly devoured. It's location is convenient and parking is readily available. Seating is plentiful so there was no wait when we arrived. Overall, a good find we'll probably go back to when we're in the mood for real Chinese din din.",0
"Jersey Mike's is okay. It's a chain place, and a bit over priced for fast food.  I ordered a philly cheese steak.  It was mostly bread, with a few thing microscopic slices of meat.  A little cheese too.  And a sliver or two of peppers.  But mostly, it was bread.  I think it's funny the people that work here try to make small talk with you.  ""So, what are you guys up to tonight?""  I think it would be fun to just try and f*#k with them, and say something like, ""Oh you know, smoking a little meth and just chilling with some hookers.""  See what they say to that.",0
"This place has a fancy exterior and you definitely pay for the ambiance. Definitely a sit down with a napkin in your lap kinda place. I have tried the tikka masala, pakuras, vegetable korma, and naan.  It's all very delicious and the portion sizes are bigger than expected. 

Drawback: kinda pricey. Not a good place for cheap take-out.  I ordered out for 3 and it cost $50!!!",1
"charlestons is one of the few chains i actually enjoy. I love their croissants and their staff is always awesome. their chicken strips are awesome. i love their grilled chicken and veggies, too. 

They have an awesome blackened grilled chicken, they don't use oil to cook either which is a plus! they no longer have it on the menu but have never given me a problem ordering it!

yay for charlestons!",1
"I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of D&B's food. Typically if I'm here it's to have a couple beers and remind my husband how good I am at ski-ball. Overall, it's a cool vibe with many different games to play. The drinks are affordable and you can't beat the location (Tempe Marketplace.)",0
"When I'm on vacation, I try to go to restaurants I try to avoid chains because what's the point?  I want to eat local eats.  As I walked in, I realized I've been to the one in Long Beach, CA though the menu was completely different. Or perhaps it was the late night menu but it was decidely more ""Southwestern.""  Ah well, it had been several years and it was quite late at night so it didn't matter at this point.

I ordered the green pork tostada which the waiter assured me was very small and the hot wings. The tostada was huge. What a liar (yes, I called him that to his face). 

I ate a couple of bites and finished the wings. I would have the tostada cold and congeal-y in the morning before flying out. Surprisingly, the flavors were locked in this way and acceptable as a 5-minute scarf fest. 

Oh, and my vodka tonic was very good.  Not bad and I kind of dug our picnic style bench high top table.",0
"Cool stable up in Cave Creek where my wife and I took a sunset ride. Very casual environment with some folks who seem to like what they're doing. 

I got a horse named Sox who wanted to move forward all the time, but was easy to control. Our guide was very informative and casual at once, had fun with us and did a great job including everyone. 

That pig is humongous! Easily the biggest pig I've ever seen. I can't believe that guy can walk around. I want a pig like that.",1
"I am always comfortable in Michelina's, the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to ""turn the table"".  Michelina's cooking is fantastic!  Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu.  The drinks are excellent, bread just right, and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish.  One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!",1
"Have you ever had the Lean Cuisine chicken enchiladas? Have you ever been to a super obnoxious sorority party, where all the blonde bimbos are tanked and dancing on tables and such? Have you ever been totally ignored by wait and bar staff even though you've doused yourself in lighter fluid and set yourself on fire? Well. Then. You've been to San Felipe's. Lower than mediocore food. Except for the grilled fish tacos. Thus 2 stars. Not 1. When I lived at DCRanch, I thought this would be a less expensive, less formal place to hang out. Hmmm...other than grabbing a quick beer here I'd sooner stay at home, eat Doritos and watch a sorority slasher film. What do Kristin and Pierre say? Meh? Yea, that's it. Meh!",0
"This is an open-air mall.  Unlike most malls which are totally enclosed, this mall is outdoors.  In the outdoor area they sometimes have ""events"".  The Batman ""Tumbler"" was there for a day once, we've heard concerts here, and this last visit they had a sculling team there with their boat.

They have many of the usual shops (American Eagle, Gap, Aeropostale, Victoria's Secret, etc).   The Harkins Theater hear is pretty nice.  We like the Genghis Grill for food (see my review of them).  The Paradise Bakery is nice also.  There are several other eateries here, but we haven't tried most of them yet.  However, several choices are available.

This is a nice mall to just wander and shop, and eat and drink, and enjoy whatever is going on.",1
Great chai lattes and friendly service!,1
"Consistent is a great word to describe this place. The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there. (they're great too). It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour. The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly. You feel like you are part of the family here. 

Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!",1
"Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care. That is why they offer a ""wellness plan"". When it comes to your animal getting sick, I would go elsewhere. It should not be called a Hopital. The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet. The vet techs care, but the doctors don't listen to them. This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health.",0
"You have to come here for the pho. Hands down!

My boyfriend lives right down the street, so whenever we're hungover, feeling sick, or need our pho fix, we always come here. Sure, we've been to the Noodles Ranch up the way, but we love going to the Saigon Bowl, it's so 'Mom&Pop.'

There's almost always no one else there and it looks super out dated. But we don't mind. We understand that Noodles Ranch is pricier than here mainly due to the atmosphere. But it's absolutely perfect if you just want to come in, sit down, guzzle down your pho and drench the meats in sauces and leave on a happy, full stomach while knowing you paid less than $9 bucks.

The portions are large, the veggie plate served with herbs, bean sprouts, jalapenos, and limes is pretty standard and of good quality and size.  The timing was just fine (although I've ordered one of their chicken entrees before and waited just a few more minutes longer than ordering the pho) and well worth the satisfaction to follow.

I've ordered just about every type of bowl of pho and have never been unhappy. Broth alone isn't anything too strong. It's light enough to have you finish the whole bowl. The meats are perfectly portioned for dipping in the sauces that are at each table and of course, the ending gulps are the most flavorful.

I'll always be coming to this place so long as it's in business.",1
"I heart Rome's Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right. 


When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (I'm always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Don't be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isn't it what's inside that counts?? 


The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what you're getting - NY style). I know that it's family owned, which I always have an appreciation for. 


The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldn't find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldn't help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house. 
I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking I'm an idiot because I didn't know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing! 

In a nutshell, hoooorray for Rome's!!",1
"Yummy, this place is great. Good burgers and you get to choose everything yourself the meat the cheese what type of sauce or veggies you want. Your not tied to a box at this place and it shows the meats are all fresh and the cheese and veggies are all top quality. I recently ate here with my family and at first thought it was a little expensive about 11.00 a burger after cheese and stuff. My personal burger was like $15.00 after I got kobe beef and horseradish cheese but the burger was very good. After thinking about it for a while it dawned on me that a Whopper is like 6 dollars and this was easily 3 to 4 times better then a Whopper. I recommend it if your looking for a good burger all natural no hormones and an entire gluten free menu.",1
"These guys scare me. We set up a repair with Karen for a noise in the dash area which i said seemed to coincide with the gauge movement at start-up. Well, we came back the next day and found we had a new stereo but the noise was louder. The dash was pulled and it was determined to be the A/C door actuators and Karen set an appt. for drop-off and rental car pick-up the following day. On the way down the A/C quit working completely. Angie called me the next morning to let me know we could pick up our one day rental as they replace the condensor. Nothing was said about the noise which we brought it in for originally and, more to the point, no knowledge of this at all was logged into their system regarding why we dropped it off the night before. We had already been set up in a rental car by Karen the day before but for some reason nobody had a clue what was going on and she and the technician had both gone on vacation. Finally after speaking with the service manager, Gary, and explaining to them what should have been in the notes on my car it was determined they would handle everything and we could keep the rental on their dime. This made me feel better and we picked up our car 2 days later with functioning A/C. On the way home from the dealership the A/C quit working again so back it went for another random repair. Tuesday came and we picked it up again after they had to make some A/C computer module fix but... on the way home from Coulter... my wife noticed the ABS and Traction Control lights were flashing red and indicating they were innoperative. So now the car was unsafe to drive but at least we had A/C to keep us cool if we had a wreck from the new issue. We took it back to night drop-off since they were now closed and this morning, Wednesday, they have it back in the shop to see what happened as they were doing the other work. I'm so happy I don't own the warranty company since I'm sure they are paying for all of these mistakes.  Hmmm...
Update to follow -

Noon 8/29 update - Our new service person, Ben, called and as it turns out this is totally unrelated to the A/C issue but is instead, the brake pedal sensor, whatever that is. It's ready to come home. I'm beginning to think that the consumer reports review on this GMC Acadia is accurate. 40K+ for a good looking, nice handling, unreliable SUV.  
Overall I have to say that once Gary and Ben were involved this has taken a turn for the better and maybe all this confusion was just a fluke. I'll give them another chance next time we have a service issue.",1
"Cashew brittle, almond brittle, bacon brittle!  Go now, before it's too late!",1
"Every time I drove by this store with my brother I mused upon the social issues faced in a FOOD CITY.  

Do you suppose they have problems with segregation/integration?  You know, the  tomatoes CLAIM that the bagels could have moved into the produce department if they had CHOSEN to; they just CHOSE to occupy shelf space in the bakery department because they LIKED being with their own kind?  Doesn't a bathroom cleaning product have the same rights to locate itself in a freezer case as a gelato does if that's what its little heart desires?  Do the canned yams believe that there is nothing wrong with the candy in the bulk food section, they just wouldn't want THEIR daughter to marry one?  I almost wanted to stick a carrot in the dairy section just to make the point.  NO MORE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL around here.  Nope, we're a modern day non-bigotted ""everybody deserves a fair shot around here"" kind of grocery store.

Well, I finally had the occasion to stop in here over the the weekend I was visiting Phoenix and was surprised to discover it catered to a mainly Hispanic customer base.  Being from Bakersfield, California, this made me feel at home at once!  There was mariachi music playing over the PA system, and there were spanish language entertainment magazines by the checkout.  

I stopped in because a friend texted me to pick up a bottle of Pinot Grigio for her.  Now, I know that those of you who shop here regularly are probably still rolling on the floor laughing, but remember - I'm from out of state and didn't know any better.  When I discovered their tiny wine section, and that it was mostly Carlo Rossi & Gallo wine, I was momentarily downcast.  But there, on the very top shelf, were a few varietals by a decent Australian Wine Cellar and - Lo and behold - one lonely Pinot Grigio.  Ta - da!  Cue cherubs descending Earthward blowing trumpets in celebration.  And to make it even more exciting IT WAS ON SALE!  Yes, normally priced at $7.99 a bottle, they were on sale for $5.99 each.  I decided to bring her two bottles just to celebrate.

The checker was very friendly and spoke English with only a minimal accent so bonus there, too.  The final kicker was when I gave my friend the receipt she discovered they'd only charged me $4.99 per bottle. Woohoo!

The store was very clean and I did notice they had an excellent selection of Hispanic themed items so if you're looking for that sort of thing, this place might be for you!",1
"These are absolutely my favorite donuts in the whole wide world!!! No offense to those Krispy Kreme lovers out there but I think Lamar's has them beat! 

Their donuts are always so fresh and delicious! My absolute favorite is the chocolate iced cake donut with m&m's. Just thinking about them is making me salivate! ;-)!! 

I suggest getting there earlier rather than later because sometimes they sell out of certain varieties.",1
"The kids and I LOVE Starbucks but this one leaves a lot to be desired.. We have been here a hand full of time and each time I keep asking myself why do I go back to this one? 

The service there is almost rude. They seem as if they are annoyed to be busy. They never seem to be happy to service you. Drinks take forever to make, even though they aren't as busy as other ones are. We won't even go into the fact that my order has been messed up the last 2 times.

The main issue I have is the fact that 3 out of 5 times when sitting and relaxing with a snack, someone has to sweep the floor near me. Really? While I am sitting there?

There are much better Starbucks and I think I am going to try some others locally.


12/06 - The kids and I went in today for our ""snack"" wanted to say things were better today. I am not going to change my rating until after my next visit ;)",0
"I used Harvil's Auto Body after a fender bender. They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farm's program. They were efficient, friendly, proactive, highly-responsive, and helpful. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed. This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by. If you have a choice, choose Harvil's. You won't be disappointed.",1
In my ongoing search for great Chinese food in Phoenix this place is a speed bump,0
"I've been back a few times since the last review but the most notable was to see DJ Z-Trip. He was awesome, no complaints there.

Bar Smith though? They failed on so many levels. 

I got there sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 and there was about a 20 minute wait out front. Not the end of the world or anything but after finally getting in, there was a sea of bodies and another very long wait. About 50 people were lined up by the stair case waiting to get upstairs. There was a bouncer not allowing anyone up there until people would slowly trickle out. Why they put Z-Trip on the patio, I don't know. It's the size of a shoe box and was clearly to capacity before 11 PM. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!! 

I was in various lines roughly 50 minutes and still hadn't made it upstairs. Forget about stepping out of line to get a drink because you'd lose your place. The short of it is I paid for pre sale tickets, managed to get there at a decent time, and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy. It was a total let down. 

At that point I was so ready to just walk out and ask for my money back. They clearly oversold the event and didn't give much thought about their patrons who paid money to see this DJ. They were going to fit every last body into that place if it killed them...and everyone else in there. 

After finally getting upstairs there were so many bodies, no one could move at all. It was a total clusterfuck. I finally made it to the back bar and stood in line for 10 minutes just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night. Fantastic. No signs saying it was a cash bar, that would have been a nice gesture. 

Also, the bathrooms were downstairs, so forget about having to pee AT ALL during the 2+ hours you're there. If you had to go, you better hold it, otherwise you'd be waiting in line for another 30 minutes just to get back up. 

By the time Z-Trip came on, the sound was bass heavy and mildly distorted. I inched my way to various parts of the patio but the sound didn't get any better, so my partner and I said fuck it and went downstairs for the rest of the night. Thankfully they were playing his set downstairs and upstairs. At least people could move more easily downstairs. Plus the sound was better. And the bathrooms were actually accessible. 

Even at the end of the night, there were people standing in line waiting to get upstairs. Bar Smith gets a huge ""F"" as far as I'm concerned. I won't be back to this place for any headlining DJ. They obviously don't know how to run an event.",0
"I like this Sam's. I get my eye exams/contacts/glasses here and some groceries. It's almost always pretty dead and therefore easy to get in and out quickly and easily. They don't have nearly the selection that most Costco do, but I've never waited in line here.",1
"Eh.

It's alright. 

If you want to have a couple of drinks and watch chicks make complete fools of themselves on the mechanical bull, be my guest.  For food and other, don't bother.

I suppose the crowd is a nice change of pace amongst Old Town's usual suspects but if you go expecting a bunch of cowboys (and cowgirls), best to turn around and go up north.  Somewhere.  Far.

The food's crap, the service (at least the server we had) was nice but a little slow (or deaf? or on something?). 

I will give it 3 stars, 1 for crowd, 1 for entertainment, and 1 for just being different.  

Word of advice, skip the nachos my friends.

*** Edit: My boyfriend would probably give this place 5 stars for the music they play.  Lot's of rock, some heavy metal, old hair bands, and some new stuff mixed in there.  No Rap.

I give it that much.  It was definitely good music.",0
"I was elated when I searched yelp for places to eat near my office and found Culvers. I ate there two days in a row last week, and ordered the follwing:

bacon butter burger, lettuce style - SO DISAPPOINTED. I had high expectations for a burger cooked in butter. While not terrible, this is not even comparable with in-n-out.

chicken fingers - Decent, although I've been spoiled by Shane's BBQ tenders which are made in house. I'm assuming Culver's came frozen in a big bag and then were deep fried. Still, pretty good for fast food.

green beans - Not cooked nearly enough for my liking, forced down several fork-fulls then threw the rest away. 

Would only visit again if co-workers dragged me along. I'm sure I would have a different view of the place if I were in glutton mode chomping on the custard and french fries.",0
"A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level.  
With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner.
They really helped when we thought no one could.  From beginning to end we were always kept informed and they got the job done.",1
"The place has a nice little vibe going on and they have some unique items but the reason the rating is so low is that there really aren't a lot of options that don't involve faux meat.  Aren't these people vegan?  Don't they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!  

I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that aren't nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.  

Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.  

I'll give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish. The fake cheeses and meats are for Vegans with meat envy, not for Omnivores that just want a good meal.  Keep your expectations in check and you should be okay.",0
"I'm a bit of a snob, I admit it. I generally prefer the full-service pamper me kind of salons that charge an arm and a leg. But times are tight - and I want my nails and my money. 

Enter Biagio. 

When you first walk into Biagio you would think you had walked into a fancy day spa. But when you read the prices, you wonder how they can stay in business. A ""spa"" pedicure, one of the most expensive treatments, is a whopping $49 (I say whopping with a sense of sarcasm). Not only do you get a great pedicure (best I've EVER received), but you get a leg and neck massage (yes the chairs are massage chairs, but real hands give you a real massage). 

A ""spa"" manicure, which also comes with a neck massage, is $25. 

The technicians are very nice, the store is immaculate, the tools are all sterilized, and the treatments are very high quality (even for a snob like me). Plus the atmosphere makes you feel like you are at a spa, not a strip-mall dive nail salon. 

I highly recommend Biagio. I have been there several times, and plan to go back often.",1
"It doesn't matter which location you go to, it's all the same and GREAT!!!",1
"I'm really getting ready to give up on this place......or boycott it a while.
What's up!? It feels like it's a confused sushi restaurant. WHY THE HECK is the music always blarring?! You can 't even hear the person sitting next to you. Are you a restaurant or a club? Do you have servers or 'visual fluffers'? And if you go at Happy Hour, expect to wait 45min to even get your food. 

*Are there authentic sushi makers there?????",0
"Found hair in my burger.  While that is not completely horrible, I was put off by another thing I saw in the restaurant.  They had red buckets of Sanitizer sitting on the food preparation counter.  While I like to see a clean restaurant, I don't think keeping a bucket full of cleaners within a couple inches of the food preparation area is wise.  Also the staff was spraying window cleaner on fixtures they were removed for cleaning. This again is a nice thing to see, but not when the overspray was going straight into the food.

Maybe a one time bad experience, but it just looked like some serious lack of supervision of the staff.",0
"Why pay full price for men's clothing when you can find quality used items here? Well Suited consistently has an excellent selection of suits, sportcoats, slacks, dress shirts and golf shirts. You can also trade in your old clothing for store credit or cash. The credit is good at any of the different stores in the My Sister's Closet chain, including all of their stores that carry men's and women's clothes, furniture and kid's apparel, furniture and toys.",1
"I'm not going to lie, Pizzeria Bianco's food was great. But 5-star worthy? Maybe not.

I didn't mind the wait, mostly due to the fact that I had been mentally preparing myself for a few days (and I also ate a snack around my normal dinner time.) The hostesses and waitstaff were kind and helpful. 

But when it comes down to it, I just didn't think the pizza was OH-MY-GOSH-WHAT-A-PIECE-OF-PIZZA good. I actually think my opinion might have been negatively tainted by the hype. It was built to such a crazy-high status; I don't think it would have been possible for any restaurant to live up to that. 

However, I do think that everyone in Phoenix should experience Pizzeria Bianco once. Plus, it is a great place to take out-of-towners or a date. It's just not somewhere that I would frequent regularly.",1
"This place is very cool! I went here after work with a sorority sister for drinks on a Friday night. Ended up staying for like 3.5 hours.

Fantastic atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Lighting is dim and intimate indoors with rustic seating areas and large booth perfect for groups getting drinks together. The outdoor patio is sectioned off in a covered area with tables and smaller seats while an uncovered area hosted seating for peeps who rode their bikes in.

The drinks are pretty yummy. If you're into fruity, girly cocktails there isn't much to choose from, but for a more mature, grown-u beverage, you're in luck. Hit the happy hour (which sadly ends at 5pm).

It gets a tad loud and it difficult to tell the wait staff apart from the customers because they're all in street clothes but they're very attentive and sweet. We ordered the fondu plate and it was great. Pretzels, sausage, apples and the cheese... perfect for sobering up a bit from those yummy cocktails.",1
"First time at St. Francis last night. Good menu selection, had an excellent server, good portion size and excellent meal.  I tried the chicken salad for dinner and it was tasty and just then right size.  They have provided a nice atmosphere with exposed brick, stainless steel tables, and just the right amount of lighting and music.  

Only downside was the backless seats at our booth. Very trendy, but somewhat uncomfortable. Ask for a table instead and you'll be fine. 

I'll return.",1
"Went for dinner before a Suns game on a Tuesday, got there at 5 and got right in, but the place filled up fast after us.  The atmosphere is awesome, a little brick house split into small rooms with a huge patio dining area.  The service was quality over all.  Very attentive at the beginning, forgot about us throughout the meal but showed up again at the check/dessert time.  We had the Burrata with proscuitto for an app., which was awesome, melt in your mouth, almost sweet cheese, and the proscuitto was like pork butter, lovely.  The pizzas were good but not what i expected when i hear thin crust.  The ingredients were definately quality but the crust was a little fluffy and chewy for my taste.  Bianco still tops the charts on pizza, but for the lack of wait, and quality of food, ambiance, and service i would definately recommend Cibo.  I plan on going back to try some more selections.",1
"I had a chicken panini and was more than enough! It was dinner and lunch!

They have this special bread that is like a big bun. The people is very friendly and patient to explain their different options. Nice place, and for sandwiches it was just good.",1
"The Vig is a breath of fresh air as far as the bar scene goes in uptown Phoenix. Nice ambiance, good vibes from both customers and employees, and overall a great concept. Anyone can come here and feel comfortable.

We went for burger night (Monday night people!), not knowing what to expect... Here's what to expect: a giant effing specialty burger (3 to choose from), cooked to perfection, served with a hearty portion of fries or sweet potato fries! FOR 5 BUCKS!

Our waiter was either stoned or really new at his job... I'll give him the benefit of the doubt even though he talked like Jeff Spicolli, and say that he was probably just new. But hey, I'm not gonna bitch on $5 burger night...",1
"It's difficult to find good bagels in Scottsdale, so my roommate and I ventured to Tempe to satiate our cravings.

We both got the open-faced bagel, cream cheese and lox.  It was excellent and fresh.  The bagel was chewy without being too bread-like.  The lox was fresh and high quality.  I will definitely be back.",1
"Ah, good 'ol standby Village Inn, where else could I, a quasi-nut case get great food at such a late hour? 

The manager misses us when we are not there to envelope the place with our gloominess. The service is really great and the food is always good. This is a much better choice over Denny's because they are cheap and the food portions are better than Denny's. Good place to wander over to after coming out of Shirt's 'n' Things.

I recommend the pie. It's free on Wednesdays",1
"My mother always told me, if I didn't have anything nice to say, say nothing!",0
"I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.

Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!

Someday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!",1
"We tried this out last night. We won't be back. 

There is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something. 

We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?

Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order. 

Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.

I ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked. 

The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza. 

I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill. 

The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck. 

Anyway, this place has some things to work on. Fortunately for us, there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance.",0
"This place is great.  They have the best veggie burger - yes veggie burger - that I have probably ever had.  It is spinach based and has chopped jalapenos in it for some kick.  When I buy an entree, my kid eats for free.  So not only is the food good but it's very fairly priced as well.  

And much better than the regular Big Fat Greek Restaurants around town.",1
"Very good Rubio's, very accommodating for my diet needs and the kids love their taquitos.  It is in a convenient location when you are shopping and don't have time to go home.  The management seems to be on top of things and keep the place very clean.",1
"I'm not generally a fan of restaurants located within a mall, especially if it's a chain restaurant. I just don't care for the mall dining atmosphere. However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.

There are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:

1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).

2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!  

3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).

Just try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place. Overall, when it comes to dining at Fashion Square Mall, Kona Grill is pretty impressive.",1
"Found this place online and we checked it out on Saturday night. It was empty when we got there around 6pm so we were a bit nervous, but the hostess told us it was a late crowd usually and the place was pretty full by the time we left.

The food was superb. One of the reasons we chose to dine here was because they offer grass fed organic meats and we split a burger that was very tasty (in fact, neither my wife or I had eaten beef in almost two years!). We also split a great salad with a well cooked Ahi steak and had the bruschetta as well. The whole menu was interesting and we'll definitely be back.

The real surprise was the beer selection. Wow. I had a tough time choosing, and then the waitress told me about the special and it sounded so good I couldn't pass it up. It was an agave wheat beer from Breckenridge and it was very tasty. 

Great little neighborhood place and we'll definitely be back. Hope it sticks around as the spot has had poor luck with restaurants.",1
"Returned for another meal and the overall experience was excellent. Only negative was that the braised leak appetizer is now somewhat drenched in cheese.. Feels a bit ""pizza hut"".",1
"Unpretentious trendy spot in the middle of the pretentious downtown scottsdale atmosphere. Beers are 3-5 but it's worth it if you sit on the patio overlooking the canal. The place is very relaxed- Don't think many have found it yet. And the awkward waiters also make you feel comfortable... sorry Steve, you're awkward.",1
"Had lunch here with my wife today. It's the second time I've been and her first. After my first visit it rocketed into my top five favourite restaurants of all time. They have some top notch food, and the best thing is that it's such a deliciously welcome change from the bottom-feeder's Mexican crap that you see all over Phoenix. The menu is varied and I think I eventually will want to try everything. Appetizers include fried alligator and frog's legs. The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta, which is linguini with tomato, thin-sliced garlic, andouille sausage, crawfish meat, onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce. Absolutely delicious. The wife had mahi-mahi with an even NICER sauce, and dirty rice on the side. Although a tiny bit on the pricy side it's definitely worth coming back to. Large open seating (outdoor seating also available), dimly lit, old-style jazz, a large full-service bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature, giant fans etc. The service was also great and both times I've been, the waiters have been very helpful (the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator, to try it 'half-blackened' - a great tip which allowed me to taste both 'styles' of the appetizer). They also have things I've not heard of before like etoufee and opelousas. If my dad didn't live over seven thousand miles away I'd take him here in an instant - he'd absolutely love the place. You will too.

Oh yeah, they have creme brulee (with fresh fruit) and sweet potato pecan pie, amongst other things, for dessert. We had the latter - yum.",1
"Set in a restored 1913 bungalow, Cibo (pronounced ""CHEE-boh"") has hardwood floors, exposed brick, a stained-glass panel and a fireplace to set the mood while revitalizing the downtown Phoenix area with beautiful salads, antipasto, artisanal pizzas and housemade fresh pasta.
    I flew in for business on a Wednesday night. My friends picked me up and they decided to take me to Cibo. 
   Right off the bat, I was impressed with the ambiance this place exudes. Every corner of this place is romantic. Great for small parties, or just two. 
   We were seated outside at a table for four. The server was very well versed with the wine list, and the menu. She right away offered some appetizer ideas, and wine parings. All good offerings. We decided on a bottle of Vipra rossa. It was over all a good wine, and went well with dinner. Also we ordered the 3 Pair Buschetta. This little gem was awesome. It came to our table on a cutting board type platter. Three little buschetta slices each having a different topping. First was grape tomatoes and basil, the second had cannelini beans, and the third had prosciutto crudo and mozzarella. Ah Mazz ING. 
    Being that I wasnt feeling super adventurous on the meal, I just ordered the Diavola pizza for one. Average pizza I'd have to say, was not very inventive. Good presentation though.
   Service was a five.",0
Best donuts I have ever had.,1
"Sometimes there's a cover, and sometimes there isn't. In true nightclub fashion, you can never really tell what it's going to be either. 

I've never seen anything good happen downstairs. The music has never been good, regardless of the genre that night (Hip Hop, Techno, etc). And, the overall vibe is pretty lackluster.

Upstairs, however, is house music heaven. Located outside under the stars, on a relatively small balcony, the vibe is always pretty stellar. Open air, video collages on the walls, and AWESOME music. I've never been let down yet. Even on a random Wednesday evening recently, when it was almost empty, the music was still amazing.

If you live in the Valley, you have to visit the upstairs of Bar Smith at least once. It's fantastic. It's a shame they've never been able to replicate any of the upstairs magic to the rest of the club though.",0
Not a company to do business with ... From my experience !',0
"A  bit surprised at the high prices but figured that the ""trendy factor in old town"" and the atmosphere was the reason because the teeny portions of the food and the quality is just GOOD, like the Good egg, not great, not bad, just good. 
No happy hour?
And Too dark inside. 
Lots of pretty wait staff. 
My first suggestion would be to fire grill the mahi tacos and not batter them, they were not that flavorful. The side dishes of street corn and some potato chorizo thing were very good. I wanted to try the guac, but 12 bucks for an avacado with some garlic and cilantro? How about trying to make a good ceviche?

My hubby and i thought that Rubios rocks in comparison, we love the shrimp tacos and the pablano and portobello tacos.",0
"This has got to be the best barber shop I've ever been to in my 38 years on this planet.  I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery (when I lived in Virginia Beach), and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jacked-up hair.  After getting my first haircut from Israel (the barber, not the country), I know I'd have a hard time looking elsewhere.  I don't know if these dudes were ever in the military, but their attention to detail is top notch.",1
"Had a couple of happy hour apps here, all flavorless. Bacon wrapped scallops: bacon undercooked, scallop overcooked.  Seared Ahi Tuna:  flavorless.  Pork sliders:  Not bad, but not memorable. Service was good. Go to Tutti Santi in the same mall instead.",0
"Well, i was very excited to go to this event, however, not so excited when it was all over. The music was great and it is a very nice place. It really reminds me of Vegas. However, it  was fashion week and we all thought that we would see models sashaying down the runway. But, no. No fashion at all. The wine was comp and it was very good ,i give great praise for that!  But the samples of food were few and far between. The Servers skipped out many times. Not like most Yelp events which are usually out the door GREAT!  We ordered from the happy hour menu.  I fully agree lots of salt, but i think it was the soy sauce, it was the most salty..i have ever had. There is very little parking here as well so be prepared for that as well.  All in all we had a good time.But, not as fabulous as most Yelp events.",1
"I am with some of the others in not understanding these poor reviews. I am from Rhode Island and Italian food is at our fingertips, and in Arizona, there are few and far between authentic non chain Italian restaurants. I feel that although ambiance is important, I didn't see anything wrong with Lo Cascio's. There were no cheesy paper protectors over a linen table cloth, and there were no paper place mats with several business names, so not sure what the issue was there. And as far as the music....I would be annoyed too if I had to work there every night, but again, it only added to the atmosphere. In my opinion, some of the best Italian food does not come with yuppie atmosphere.
  For the appetizer we had the fried mozzarella which my husband and I enjoyed very much. The marinara poured over it was on the chunkier side and I loved it because it tasted just like a sauce an old Italian friend of mine made. It was perfect. I had eggplant parmesan for my entree, and it tasted just like NYC Italian. The eggplant didn't have the shit fried out of it, and it had the finest light coating just the way I love my favorite dish. And my husband had veal milanese which was out of this world. It was in a sauce of lemon and wine, mushrooms and artichokes.
  I also want to mention, we had the most Attentive waitress that I have ever had. Her name is Katie, and she was very sweet always asking us after each course if we needed anything and how everything tasted.
  We will definitely be back here, we live down the road now in our new home and I am very happy there is a great little Italian restaurant nearby. I am also happy I didn't let the negative reviews scare me.",1
"I do not typically go to chain restaurants & then yelp 4 stars but I was genuinely impressed with our server (Cliff) and Carrabas kitchen.  I have been doing a food detox as of the first of the year and the waiter AND the kitchen were so accomodating, even going as far as asking if it was OK with me if they could add certain vegetables to my salad I had ordered (they wanted it to look nice and taste good) to make it more filling.. who does that!?  They do!  Went with my bro, his gf, and my hubby and they had a great old-vine Zin (bottles of wine are on special on Wednesdays) and they seemed to enjoy their meal (though my bro thought his veal marsala was a bit smaller than it should be).  We were seated promptly, the staff (Cliff & kitchen guys) was very attentive and I have to give them 4 stars for going above and beyond what chain restaurants usually serve.",1
"Looking for good Philadelphia street eats? Well, Forefathers Cheesesteaks & Fries is the place for you!

While Forefathers' is light on Philadelphia decor like the Liberty Bell, the sandwiches would give fan favorite Philly restaurants like Pat's, Geno's or Jim's a run for their money. And you don't have to be a Cheese Whiz fan. The gooey provolone on my sandwich left my mouth watering. The sweet potato fries were equally good. Be sure to sample the available dipping sauces like ranch, honey mustard, or (my fave) fries sauce.

The next time you're in the mood for cholesterol count busting goodness, be sure to check this place out. Even Ben Franklin wouldn't need his bifocal specs to see that Forefathers is worth a fry...oops, I mean, try.",1

"Ben & Jerry's is still the best chain ice cream shop! The employees are always helpful and polite, and their flavors are just outrageous!

"I always feel a sense of guilt having to write a less than stellar review after meeting the owner of a restaurant. 

Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat. 

I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap. 

Notice it says ""Roasted"", the cashier told me the Veggies were ""Grilled"". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither. 

Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, I'd guess the latter, and the ""Sun Dried Tomato Wrap"" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which I'm sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix. 

It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is. 

This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a ""Best Seller"". 

Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since I'm Vegan and the desserts aren't. 

Honestly, in my opinion, aside from the market, most of the menu items are anything but healthy. 

The 3 stars is for the market, my food would have been 1.

And that folks is why I am the Lunch Snob!",0
"This place needs no more great reviews really but damn was it good.

Recent Sat night: first time.  Busy, hour wait, unless you sit by bar which was zero wait.  We sat by the bar.  

Very cool, hip place.  I remember the Clarendon but had no idea it got all cool and modernized, when did that happen?

Anyways, ordered 2 house margaritas (excellent, very fresh, perfect), then ordered 2 more..... buzzed alert***

Elote, teeth sunk in, amazing alert***

Spit shrimp cocktail, oh yeah.....its on.

Tacos carne asada, so fresh, so good.  Great chips and salsa, the thick kind of chips, authentic type, like in Mexico.  

For some reason I ordered a burger?  Huh?  It was a hasty decision and the burger was just OK.  Next time, no burgers, just tacos etc for me.

Even as busy as it was, the service up at the bar was perfect.  

I will certainly go back at some point.  Maybe not rush back just because of the busy factor, but hey what isn't busy at these hip trendy little places in town, right?",1
"I really like this little dive bar and was quite taken back by the fact they were shut down yesterday. I'm a frequent visitor, and they have a decent selection on the jukebox (touchtunes). The food is typical bar fare, but decent.. got a kickin' deal on chicken wings on a Monday night. I hope they recover because they are the best thing for a dive bar fan in Gilbert!",1
":( I really wanted to like this place. I thoroughly enjoyed the farm, but I will review it separately. We were greeted by a busy waiter who quickly pointed to self-serve drinks (coffee, tea, water and lemonade) and ran off. We helped ourselves to some coffee and lemonade before we received our menus which stated that each drink was $2.75. I ordered the white truffled scrambled egg skillet (white truffles are my fave). I did not detect one bit of truffle essence in this dish. My fiance ordered the Cowboy Breakfast. It was like watered down chili with and egg on top. No great. The concept is great, but the way in which the food is prepared is super disappointing.",0
"As good as I always remember it to be.
Their fries are way better than In-n-Out (I am a fries connoisseur)

Their burgers may be getting smaller? Still delicious as ever.

I pass on the drink though, an extra $2+ makes the meal quite expensive..

Price: $9+ for the cheeseburger (double) and Regular fries
(in-n-out: $6+ for double-double and fries - half the size)

I would eat here every day if I had the option.",1
"I had the pleasure of visiting FBH with my fave Foodie Bear and Robert a while back. (Yeah I'm behind on reviews). All I can say is WOW. I have become a fan of FBH. We walked in to a small, clean space. You order your yummy meal at the counter and you have to be quick to grab a table! My advice, grab a table then go order. For my yummy meal I had the fry bread with beans and green chile. I was delighted to see that I could wash my guilt-ridden meal down with Big Red Cream soda...mmm.. When I bit into my fry bread it was crispy and light on the outside and nice and chewy in the middle. It was so good. I wished for a little more spice or flavor from the green chile sauce, but it still did the job. We also tried the chocolate and butter fry bread. It was so-so in my opinion, but I'm not much of a sweets person so definitely not a knock on FBH! 

I will certainly visit FBH again maybe after I do a giant work out or have been fasting for 5 days... it's just too good to eat on a regular basis!",1
Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries,1
"I remember when this was Fry's...back in the 70's. I think it's great when these older buildings are put to good use instead of being torn down for another new strip mall. What a perfect place for an Antique Mall.

This is a store that you could spend hours and hours really looking at everything. This Antique Mall has TONS of GREAT Antique finds...like REAL antique and retro STUFF, not recent overpriced crap that most Antique Dealers throw in their booth and try to pass off as something worth a lot of money. There are things here that I haven't ever seen at other Antique stores before.

I quickly walked down the aisles, the prices seemed pretty good and yet some that seemed OVERPRICED. I wonder if Antique Dealers are wanting to sell merchandise or pay monthly rent to store their museum. Believe it or not, you can still get BETTER deals on ebay.

Several of the booths seemed like they had a theme, like stepping back into that time era... they were merchandised nicely.

The restroom even looked like some grandmother's tacky bathroom decor, it really fit in well with the antique feeling.

I will definitely come back here when I have more time to shop.

"My family and I love this place. Yummy food, great service, kid friendly, rarely a wait, great prices, nice beer selection, food always comes out hot, and people around you are having a good time. The boneless chicken with raspberry barbecue sauce is so so yummy!",1
"I had the Crispy Steelhead, and it was delicious! The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition. If you're looking for a great restaurant with an original menu, this is the place to go! Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us.",1
A good place for bugers and fries.,0
"Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...",1
"Love the atmosphere, the patios, drinks and especially the chicken lollipops.  If you haven't tried them, they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat.  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books!

I am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi.  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game.  Not too stuffy, but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar.",1
"Loved the scenic restaurant, right in the middle of the farm. My #1 spot for a weekend brunch.",1
It was my first visit to Wienerschnitzel and OMG two words CORN DOG! It is better than the ones at the State Fair. I also had the polish dog. I am sorry but Costco's is better. The french fries were OK. The best thing I had was the corn dog.,0
"One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch.  Bring a small amount of $ - grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight.  The entire ""patio"" is really a large, fenced grassy, tree filled area with 2 volleyball courts, multiple gathering areas, ping pong, horse shoes, jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids.",1
"LOVE Chino Bandido.  The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven.  Well, all of the food might actually be heaven, but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot.",1
"If you have been to one CPK, you have more or less been to all of them. I went through a stretch when I really liked it here and I still don't mind it, I guess I just don't get excited about it anymore. 

The BBQ Chicken pizza is my go-to but the Thai variations are tasty, as well. The appetizers are ok, the service is ok, but it all just seems a little played out to me. 

I am waiting for CPK to make some moves, shake things up, add something interesting to the menu, because I feel like nothing has changed there since 1992. 

I'll still drop in from time to time, but I won't be as excited about it as I used to be.",0
"I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv.

I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant.

I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well.

I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say, I won't be eating at Hooters anytime soon.",0
"Great location, great food, and nice ambiance.  The menu isn't huge, but this is a nice French cafe type setting if that's what you're into.",1
"This just in: Houstons is on steroids! Yup, it's true. 

If you're familiar with Houston's you're familiar with Hillstone. But, Hillstone is better in my opinion. Why? 

-Wonderful outside ""first come first served"" patio seating with fireplaces 
-Indoor/Outdoor space for the bar area 
-A sushi bar (and shockingly really good sushi. We had the mango salmon roll - delicious). 
-No need to worry about Valet... lots of parking. 
-Great service.

What hasn't changed is the menu and the crowd. Still your 40+ real estate suits - or should I say jeans + a blazer - and all the cougary women that come along with these men... Not knocking it, simply the truth.

Overall, a great place for a good American meal, people watching or to take your parents. This isn't a place you'll be racing to take your friends who just came into town... it's a chain restaurant. There are way too many locally owned gems in the Valley to spend too much time here.",1
"I feel like such a noob. We consider ourselves foodies to a certain degree, but before joining Yelp we had never heard of this magical mysterious place called Fez. So after seeing the sheer volume of good reviews on the place, it was pretty much destiny that a trip to Fez was in order. 

Upon first arriving there the first thing that'll catch your eye is how trendy it is. The place is drenched with a hipster vibe that's hard to shake. You'll also quickly notice a very skewed gay:straight ratio. I would usually never bring this up, but it was quite obvious the night we went that we were possibly one of the only straight couples there. This extends to the waiters too... don't get me wrong, I have no problem with it... in fact it made for a more fun and interesting dining experience; just be forewarned if you aren't comfortable with things like being offered a drink called ""The G-Spot"" by a feminine male waiter, this may not be the type of place for you. 

So now... onto the food. The food was superb... starting off with those heavenly Cinnamon-dusted Sweet Potato Fries. Damn they're good... basically they're some of the best fries I've ever had, period. I bow down the God of Cinnamon and Sweet Potatoes... because the combination is heavenly. For our main dish we got a Fez Kisra followed by the Apricot glazed Salmon. Both were quite yummy. The Kisra is basically a healthier version of a pizza with some more adventurous types of toppings... the one we got had pears on it. It was good, but would be hard to eat one alone because the flavor is quite distinct and a little rich... so it's perfect to split. The salmon was well cooked and flavorful, no complaints there. 

Overall we had a great meal at Fez, we'll more than likely be back... if anything to try 'Fez Foodies' which we've heard so much about. What a cool place!",1
"They finally just opened a Rita's location in Surprise!! I think it just opened yesterday or today, but it's just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue.  I told my co-workers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months.
It's hard to explain the texture of the ice. It's thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita, yet it's not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink. Sonic has similar ice, but I feel like it's just not as good as Rita's. I guess that's why it's Italian ice. It's in its own category!

There are 3 main types: Gelati's (custard-ice-custard), Blendini's (custard-ice-custard with mix ins like Oreos, M&Ms, etc), and Mistos (ice-custard drink). You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone. One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish. There's also a sugar substitute version of their ice and today's sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple. I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing!
The menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices. There are mainly only 2 types of custards though, vanilla and chocolate, that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change. 
Before, I was solely a fan of ice cream and yogurt. Now, I am grateful that my sister-in-law dragged me here, because there is nothing quite like it yet! Now I will always compare Italian ices to this place.",1
"They have high definition pictures of their menu items proudly displayed on the walls, and I like that.

Regarding the Chicken Pad Thai. The chicken and tofu were cooked perfectly, but the noodles were a bit chewy.

Spring rolls were great. The pic on the menu shows them served in halves, but they arrived at our table whole.

My date had their Thai noodle bowl, and Id suggest skipping on the beef balls.  Also, its very bland if you order with no spice.

The owner recommended that we vacation in Thailand.  He also offered to install new granite flooring in out home.  Travel agent, mason, restaurateur.  He does it all.",0
"the promise of homemade turkey and roast beef drew me in, much to my dismay it's shredded. As Ramsey would say 'like a dog's dinner!'. I got the bobby with roast beef, so i could taste both. The bread was good, the stuffing was cold. The meat was chokingly dry. Dry dry. Sawdust tasting. I'm sure the other non shredded meats are great on that bread, this might as well had just been the stuffing and cranberries on the bread. Plus, the manager was bragging about how he just stands around and does nothing but micro manage. Donkeys! Lol. Make that guy clean the bathrooms!",0
"The ""chicken burger"" with jerk sauce was gross. It was dried out with terrible flavor. The only saving grace was that it was small, which says enough right there. As another reviewed said, it was a ground chicken patty when I was expecting a grilled chicken breast after going to places like Johnny Rockets where I believe they have a similarly named section of the menu that refers to chicken breast sandwiches. I realize I have myself to blame on that misunderstanding, but it was still a terrible sandwich.",0
"Wait a second...I have not written a review!  This is nuts!!!!!

Anyways...I adore this place.  LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world...lol...I am here at least 4-6 times per week.  It is nuts!  Anyways..the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS!!!!  This place can never go wrong!  The orange and fennel salad it amazing!  It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds!  I often get this salad through out the week.  I love the kale and quinoa salad too!  It is my go to salad.  I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto.  I wish I could get enough but I cannot!  The ambiance is awesome! Mr.Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open.  I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time.  The parking is difficult, but you expect that since it is so popular!  Now the Peanut Butter Pie!!!  OMG OMG OMG!!  There are no words...it is DELICIOUS!!  I try to refuse every time but I cannot.  I really enjoy the sangria.  The wine selection is great!  I just love this place!!!!",1
"YUUKK!!!

That pretty much describes this place.  We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Only 1 person in line in front of us.  I ordered the 2 meat combo, rib tips and hot links...sides of mac & cheese and potato salad.   

...it took about 40 mins to get my food.  But I told myself if it was good...then it's worth the wait.  But by God it wasn't good at all.  The mac & cheese had no flavor at all...i mean none.  The potato salad was very flavorless as well.  The rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce, nasty bbq sauce at that.  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.  So couldn't tell if they were any good, cause there was so much of that damn sauce.

The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me, got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.  I wish I would have done the same instead of spending $15+ on nasty bbq.

In short.  I will not be going back here.",0
Nice resort located in downtown Chandler. The rooms are spacious and fairly comfortable . Chill by the pool and sip on a margarita from the pool bar.,0
"Good water pressure.  $2 = 6 min. Cons- ""water pressure gun"" rubber tips come OFF -can scratch car paint. Had to back out since a car blocked me forward-then a hose (which I put back) caught my car. Hispanc guy gets angry/curses. The ceiling 360 degress brush holder gets jammed. 1 is bent. Stalls get muddy.  Vacuums not strong.",1
"Okay...this was very surprising since it was just voted Best Southwestern food in PHX mag's Best of the Valley issue...and thus, it made us want to have a visit.

I LOVE southwestern food...and I was very let down by this place.  I feel like I should give it 3 stars...but as an ""A-OK"" rating, I just can't.  If 3 stars were for ""OK food"" then I'd give it 3 stars.  But truly, I have...I have had better.

PHX Mag said to try the crab cakes, which we did, and they were delicious.  Very happy with them and therefore expected the entrees to be just as great...but they weren't.  : (  I had the salmon, which the waitress recommended and it was such a bummer.  It had way too many conflicting tastes going on that didn't seem to blend at all.  I lost my appetite after a few bites.  My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which were just...average.  We were really disappointed.  

Again, the crab cake appetizer was great and the two margaritas were as well - the Tontorita and the Prickly Pear - both very, very yummy.  

But overall, if PHX Mag continues to recommend more lame-oid meals, I'm gonna have to start using it as wrapping paper instead of a go-to guide for great meals in this town.",0
"Who doesn't like Costco? I can only see two drawbacks.  One - do NOT go on a weekend.  It is crazy unless you go when it opens and get outta there quick.  Two - you only have two people in your household so you don't really need a 20 lb bag of broccoli or a whole box of strawberries or tangerines.  Other than that it's a great place to stock up.  They have great deals on most frozen foods (try the all natural fish sticks).  Great deals on bottled water and cases of soda too.  If you buy a giant pack of Q-tips you won't run out for years!!  I love the ""Wipe and Clean"" individually wrapped cleaners for your glasses.  They come in a giant box of either 200 or 300 and last for at least six months.  They have good deals on books, DVDs, CDs, boxes and bags of snack foods like Doritos and Sun Chips, pretzels and microwave popcorn.  The bakery has some good stuff too.  I don't typically buy meat here because I do not have a large family nor do I have occasion to feed many people.  I hear the meat department is quite good though.  And Costco usually has the cheapest gas around too.  It's usually almost 10 cents cheaper then the closest gas station to me and I can stop by Costco on my way home from work.  Now if you're shopping and you require a snack, hit the snack bar.  Pizza by the slice, hot dogs, and these yummy things they call chicken bakes are pretty inexpensive.  So where else can you stock up, get cheap gas and get a snack for cheap?  Costco!  It's worth the membership and that membership gets you other perks too. They send coupons in the mail every month.  If you don't have a card, you should get one and check it out.  I believe they only accept Amex cards but they do accept debit cards and cash of course.",1
"I was severely mislead by Frank A's, ""It's hot, but the food ain't bad."" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return.",0
I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend. I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food. Little Italy did not disappoint!! I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!! Plus the service was great too. Fast and friendly.,1
"I went for lunch with my mother-in-law, she had the veggie fajitas, and I had a chicken burro with green enchilada sauce. we both enjoyed our meals.",1
"Their happy hour is crazy cheap!!!

The scene though is like a poor mans Rehab/Wet Republic, but I'm not mad! It gets really crackin there especially on the weekends (suffice to say, I was only there for a weekend hahaha). This is definitely a spot to checkout while in Scottsdale!",1
"I'm used to Ranch 99 back in Northern California, and this supermarket wasn't anything spectacular. This is a good place if you want seafood! All of the traffic was around that area. The food from the take-out section didn't look too good.

The market also has the bakery, peking duck, the flattened 1/2 duck, and roasted chicken. 

There is also Hong Kong Express to-go food where you can order noodles, dim sum, congee, boba drinks, rice dishes, etc. It's right next to the take-out food. 

The most interesting part of the supermarket was the selling of Chinese pancakes in front of the store. You can order mini pancakes with either a red bean, coconut, or custard filling. Each pancake is made to order and is $.50 each. I tried both the custard and red bean pancakes and it was pretty good! Cash only payment for the pancakes. You also have to wait awhile for the pancakes since there is a long line.",0
"""One, two Feddys coming for you!"" ""Three, four better lock your door!"" ""Five, six pick up a crucifix!"" ""Seven, eight better stay up late!"" ""Nine, ten if Freddy Kruger went to Lush he'd have had great skin!""

Dude, this place is AMAZING! All of their products are all natural, freshly made without preservatives, and are just incredible.  My best friend and  went here after a four martini lunch plus shopping, and we had a had treatment done with their Ocean Salt Cleaner and exfoliator.  It is made with sea salt and smells just like a margarita!  his was followed by using their dream cream, and now I am hooked!  And it's not just the martinis!  I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a reaction.  They also have a great men's line as well.  I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face, and I have no razor burn.  It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave.  Wow!  I have never felt good after a shave!

Anyway, I could gush all day about this place, but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural, and many are vegan,  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony, and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time, so the cost is really not that high.  Get thee to Lush!",1
"Firesky Resort is a marvelous place to unwind and enjoy the warm dry evening air and fire-lit torches.  Whenever I have the opportunity to stay in the Kimpton Hotel Group's locations, I always know I've made the right choice.  The hotel was beautiful, hip and inviting.  

I gave them three stars because the rooms were a nice, but not fabulous, the amenities of L'occitane products definitely helped.  The restaurant Taggio was fine, wasn't spectacular and definitely was the part of the hotel which was least memorable.  

The staff was friendly and helpful.  I'd stay here again, but with the expectation of enjoying the wonderful pool/cabana area and leaving the resort for dinner.  Scottsdale has so much to offer, what was I thinking....",0
The food here is generally pretty good.  Drink selection is great.  Service is normally above average.  The only thing stopping it from getting 5 stars is that it's a bit expensive relative to comparable quality places.,1
"Had the Korean Beef over white rice. What a great dish. 

Thin sliced beef in a garlic brown sauce with onions and great taste, served with a side of white rice. NOTHING over the top nothing trying to be something it is not. Just good food.",1
"So I finally made it to The Grind.  A friend and I went for a late lunch (after 2pm) and had the place pretty much to ourselves so the service was spot on.  We sat at the bar and drank bottled Kiltlifter...I've only had it on tap or from the can so that was a nice surprise.  She had a burger topped with some sort of fried veggies and watercress...I know she loved every bite 'cause she refused to share with me.  I had The Crisp Pork Sandwich.  It was topped with swiss, pickles and iceburg and what I believed to be a house made BBQ suace.  I gotta say I don't know where the ""Crisp"" part came in and the sauce was good but it didn't blow my face off with wows.  To make things more (or less) forgettable it was room temp, at best.  All that nay-saying aside...I killed the sandwich.  It was a good sandwich.  We shared the sweet potato fritters.  I think I would've liked them more if I wasn't expecting something completely different...something with a ""no shit?"" factor.  Admittedly, my bad.  But everyone else should know they are pretty much sweet potato mash shaped into coins or pucks, breaded with mild seasonings and fried (possibly baked?).  That's all.  No hating...just saying.  The sweet potato fritters at The Grind are sweet potato fritters....don't get all excited like my buddy and me did before ordering them.  The room was tidy and clean.  The music was the right kinda 2pm vibe.  The bartender was attentive.  The food was thoughtful but possibly not executed to it's highest potential.  They have Kiltlifter in a bottle.  If I were you...I'd go to the grind.  Represent local talent, Phoenix.  Chef McLinn and his colleagues...waiters, FOH managers, dishwashers and prep cooks are the Gin Blossoms or the R. Kline and the Peacemakers, the Jimmy Eat World or Eastonashe, the Headroom of the food and beverage, scene and attraction in this town.  If it weren't for guys like Comer Smith, Jarrod Porter, Jay Bogsinski, Pattrick Fagan, Matt Carter, Payton Curry, Aaron Chamberlin, Chris Curtis, Beau Macmillan, and Matt McLinn we'd have no music-food to listen-eat.  You might not love every single song the band is playing...but just knowing that they're what we got should be enough to get us to invest in understanding their talents and appreciate what they're doing for us.  I can't make a pulled pork sandwich...but I know someone who can.  You should go try these guys out...they sound-taste as good as any sandwich joint could.  All they need is a few more groupies to spread the word and before you know it, The Grind is gonna be a classic.",1
"the food was okay, it's a bit pricey. I liked the big wood boat they served our sushi on. not my favorite but don't hate it either.",0
This charming little place not only has the BEST custom spray tan around - they can also whiten your teeth and have a rotating selection of adorable summer dresses on the cheap! If you are sick of being orange or baking under the harmful uv rays check this place out! First time clients get a discount! I will never go anywhere else!,1
"Being a San Jose native, I know Pho and Vietnamese cuisine. Let me tell you, Khai Hoan is excellent.  Definitely the best I have had in AZ and comparable to the best noodle houses in San Jose.  

The pho (rice noodle soup) is great- beef or chicken.  The dry noodles and rice dishes are generous portions, and very tasty.  Great ingredients in everything.  Make sure you get an order of spring rolls.  . .   

If you have not had Vietnamese food, check it out!  It is fantastic.  If you have had Vietnamese, go to Khai Hoan and you will not be disappointed.",1
"My favorite restaurant in AZ, No Contest!!! Awesome staff, delicious food and the best salsa!!!!",1
"It is a total dive bar...If you need a drink go get one.  There are pool tables, shuffle board, video game or two, and a jukebox.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Enough said!",0
"If I had a higher salary, I would shop here. I love this store, however the only reason I come here is if I am looking for something you can't get at a large grocery chain like a Fry's Marketplace.

They have a great wine selection, fine imported cheeses and the pastry counter makes your mouth water. When they are having a sale on steak I always buy it here.",1
"Wow!  This place completely rocks!  Very professional, courteous, and very good at what they do - make cars clean again.  The price was very reasonable and I will be back again many times over!  Thank you, Stewart Detailing!  Job well done.",1
"...NOW WE'RE TALKIN'! Killer Mexican Food! The chips 'n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance.",1
"marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating.  we used restaurant.com coupon and got stuck wtih an 18% tip...with no service, seriously???  felt scammed...think we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price.  avoid this one, just not worth it.",0
"I'm giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves. 

This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center. It's open until 9 on the weekdays and they don't make you feel rushed if you get there at oh let's say...8:50. In fact, they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly. 

This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here. 

So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings.",1
"Okay I have found my new favorite ""home office!""  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.",1
"Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.

As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem.",1
"I found this place whilst trying to find good mac and cheese places on yelp. I'll be honest, I love my wine and I love my cheese. Bonus points if its melted over mac.

And they do great mac and cheese. Some better than others- my favorite so far has actually been the spinach and pesto. If you want the chorizo, I say pass. The spinach or the bacon is much better. If you're into bleu cheese, the bleu cheese mac is VERY bleu. Take that for what it's worth. 

That's not all they do either. Their entrees are consistently great. My boyfriend got some scallops that were incredible, though I don't think it's on their menu now.

Their wines are great too. I'll be honest, I'm no connoisseur, but they had a moscato from Israel that the bf still drools over. It's enough that the next time I was there I picked up a whole bottle, just for him. I've also had one of their mojitos and that was great as well.

As a note- if you're in for happy hour and get a cheese plate... I really do think its better to splurge and get a regular cheese plate. I got a happy hour cheese plate, and it's... miniscule. All of the stuff that made their non happy hour cheese plate awesome was diminished. 1 cheese instead of 3. No boursin. Fewer crackers. Less of that fantastic orange blossom honey and apples. You get my drift. 

Definitely a must try. Service is great and attentive, and it's always been nice and quiet when I went in.",1
"We live in Chandler, so we get take out here probably once a month. My husband is from the east coast and in both his and my opinion, these are the best cheesesteaks around! We love their spicy peppers (they are hot!) and while I am not really a cheesesteak fan, their chicken cheesesteak sandwiches are fabulous! The owners are hard working and really appreciate all of their customers and let you know it! 

We have been eating here for three years now and have never had a bad experience.",1
"Make sure to explain to your friends that it's not a chili place.  

Every time I invite someone to check this out they assume its some greasy spoon that serves cowboy beans.  It's actually a upscale semi-formal restaurant and......the food is delicious and intelligent.

I've been here for all three meals.  The brunch is good but the dinner is what really sings.

If you like mushrooms, get off here and get your tail to Cowboy Ciao.  The Mushroom Pan Fry has something like 10 or 11 different types of mushrooms.  I'm not the biggest mushroom fanatic but even I thought it was awesome.

If you've ever read one of my reviews you know I'm all about a good burger.  The Wagyu burger here is freaking phenomenal.  Challah bread AND a truffle aoli AND some amazing bacon..........MY GOD!

Definitely recommended!",1
"Thank you to Sarah L for bringing to my attention that the lunch menu from which I got my information about the $34 crab cake entree was for the NYC location. However, I did note that the crab cake appetizer at the Scottsdale location  - presumably a smaller portion than the lunch entree - is $16. Yes, yes. It is Barney's and I understand the premium pricing. What I question is how Fred's scored only $$. I often eat out with those on a tighter foodie budget than mine; the $$ is misleading, when Oregano's is also $$. Just sayin'.",0
This place isn't all that but there food is OK.  There are better Chinese options for the price (try Chinese Cultural Center restaurants).  The restaurant itself is well furnished and clean but I can't get over the fact that people rave about this place.,0
"This place was never attractive to me, until it was the only place showing a good documentary I wanted to watch. Nice surprise! I only expect to see other good alternative movies here more often.",1
"pretentious and bad service - attendants are totally clueless (though I feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear). overpriced fashion brands.  if you want to spend $200 on a flannel, there are MUCH better options out there.  run in and glance at the sale rack, otherwise avoid this place like the plague.",0
"Stopped in here for lunch the other day.  I ordered the Marzen barbecue chicken sandwich with garlic fries.  The sauce on the sandwich was good but the chicken breast was pretty tasteless.  The garlic fries were a winner!

Service at the bar was fast and friendly.  It was nice to have a TV to watch as I ate lunch.",0
"Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.

The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  

For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.  

Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night.",1
"I enjoyed our night at Suede.  My husband I got there early and grabbed a few drinks ($4 Trump Vodka drinks- sa-weet!) and headed out to the patio.  I really liked the design of the place, especially the huge outdoor area.  Since we got there early in the night there wasn't a DJ playing yet and the only other patrons were two other young men.  As the night went on the crowd grew ever more interesting- from the undergrads that shared a table with us to the large group of 30/40 something men at the next table to what I would call here in Boston ""fashionably challenged"" girls and meathead boys.  The DJ started around 10 and man, it brought me right back to my sophomore year in college.  (Circa 2000-2001)  He was spinning all the hits from 7 years ago!  Not that I didn't enjoy my sophomore year, it was awesome, it was just not expected.   Once again, it was another place in Scottsdale where we only spent about $50 or so on drinks for the night.

All in all though I did enjoy Suede and my husband and I will definitely be returning.",1
"First time here, it's late night and I wanted something lite and healthy..  

The place is open very late, they had lots of options and the food was perfect.

What a beautiful place inside, simple yet elegant.  Oh, the service was great too......

Go for a late night drink with a date and they'll be impressed.",0
"went there for sunday morning hangover breakfast. the mariachi band, while maybe nice outside or not so loud, was so overpowering that we could not talk... the trumpet was terrible for hangover ears... not peaceful or calm at all- so we sat outside. food was good. service was decent. a little pricey but okay because thats what every downtown restaurant has to do. i would go back... just not near that mariachi band.",0
"The BEST Japanese food in AZ! Guaranteed! When you are looking for original Japanese food, or the closest taste to Japan, this would be it! The sushi is soooo fresh and they always carry out items that are not available in other sushi place like uni or sweet little octopus that I love! Their ramen is also superb and if you come here for lunch, don't forget to check in their special of the day cause they offer a great price with superb taste and lots of variety for lunch!! Love this place so much!",1
"Five bucks for a bottle of Miller Lite says pretty much everything you need to know about this place.

Also, if you are planning on attending a show here, plan on paying for parking.

I have seen some terrible sound guys here, but it's hard to say if that is the fault of the Marquee - a lot of bands that would play here tour with sound people.

The majority of the problems here are problems with venues of this size everywhere in the country - the parking, the over-priced shitty beer, the strip-search upon entry, the lack of re-entry.

Still, if there was any competition for a venue in that part of the Valley that could handle bands that are as popular as the bands that play at the Marquee, they'd be hard-pressed to do a less-enthusiastic job of it.

Also, the sloped floors make it easier to see a band from further away, but they also can KILL your back.",0
"Happy hour in Phoenix from 5PM to midnight on Thursdays? Yes, at Devil's! Hey, it's Phoenix; you need to escape the 100 plus degree scorching weather in a casual place. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun and lively. Mind you, my disclaimer about Phoenix qualifies my prior observations of Devil's-it's good for being in Phoenix. Devil's is a fun place to get stupid and have a good time in a casual setting. It does remind of a frat party though.",0
"Are you looking to get a cat? if so, check out PetSmart. My wife and I adopted a kitten here and she's awesome.

There are always several cats (occasionally dogs) looking for a good home, some older cats (a few years old and some kittens.) There is an adoption fee, but the cats will come with their shots and are neutered/spayed.

We also use this store to get both wet and dry food and toys on occasion. There are many sizes and brands to choose from at good prices. The food is cheaper at PetSmart than Petco, unless the item is on sale.

I would recommend to get a PetSmart card to save a few bucks.

The store is always clean and staff very friendly and helpful.",1
"My husband and I have been going to the Touch of Thai for years. We meet up there at least twice a month for a lunch date. On special occasions we take friends and family there for dinner. I love the wait staff - especially Nick! His wonderful sarcasm and jokes always make our day! 

For the amount of food you get at lunch at the price they charge - you can't beat it. Everything is homemade and tastes fresh. #3 Yellow Curry is my hubby's favorite. Rich coconut based sauce with yellow curry. The chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked perfectly. I venture off and try things from time to time. The food is spicy. I like the incorporation of fresh herbs into the dishes. The soup served with lunch is always yummy and changes from time to time. We always get a side order of spring rolls. You need to try these! I like the Pad Thai as well as the #5 and #7 lunch specials. Meals are served fairly quickly. 

Sometimes we have to get up and refill our own water glasses however I find this to be a wee bit charming. Feels like I am home. If you go there on a regular basis the servers remember you, have your order into the kitchen before you even are seated, and always say hello and smile.",1
Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.,1
"I have been here a few times over the last 4 years and really liked it.  It was horrible on Saturday night (5/28).  I ordered the enchiladas with chicken.  When it arrived there were 3 tiny enchiladas with an ounce of cheese inside the soggy tortillas and the ""with"" chicken part apparently meant a few chunks of chicken would be tossed on top.  I was so disappointed, but starving so I ate it.  The guacamole was really disappointing too.  I don't think we will go back again.",0
"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this place. When I first saw the address, I was very skeptical. It is in Sunnyslope. I literally had to tell myself that there are still some gems on Central and that this place was probably one of them. I'm so glad I had that talk with myself. This place is nestled into a great little area of shops and cute patio homes, small businesses and a school. They have a great atmosphere, the inside has roll-up, garage doors and there is a huge patio. 

My friends and I settled into one of the sofa areas and made ourselves comfortable. They have a decent happy hour, all wines are 1/2 off and beer is $2.00 off. We ended up having some wine and a selection of brushetta, all was pretty yummy.  The brushetta wasn't the best I have ever had, but there was a nice selection and it was pretty tasty.  We had the brie and apples (delicious, how could you go wrong), mozzarella and tomatoe (also really yummy), brie and bacon which I didn't try and the tapenade (a little salty, but what can you expect from chopped up olives?).  Once happy hour ended, our very knowledgeable and helpful server told us that for $20 we could get a bottle of wine and another order of brushetta, so we did. Hey, why not, it's Monday!?! 

Ultimately, I was only supposed to stay for an hour (I was sick and jet-lagged and just needed to go home) and I ended up staying for almost four hours. As it got darker, the place took on a very sexy, relaxed vibe. I definitely like the place and I will be back. 

Good atmosphere, good food, reasonable prices and friendly service.",1
"Everyone I've talked to that likes this place says the same thing, ""I've been going there for years.""  Yes - and perhaps years ago it didn't feel like a dive restaurant in constant jeopardy of being shut down for health code violations.  But now...

The food is completely, unmistakably mediocre.  As is the service.  Maybe it's not filthy - maybe it's just the lighting and decor that makes it look like that way.  But I'm pretty sure the roach I saw dart up the wall was real.

(Okay - that's a cheap shot - there are probably roaches in many places I've gone and I just haven't seen them.  Fair point.)

Nothing about this place makes it a can't miss.  I get the history, the nostalgia, and the fact that some famous people have dined there, but you can find better Mexican food all over the Valley and some just a short drive away.",0
"I was excited about the concept of a haircut and a beer.  So, when I saw an offer from Livingsocial I purchased three coupons.  Here's the trouble... I went on a Tuesday night at 6:30pm and was told they will not honor the coupon until 7pm.  However, I was told if I wanted to pay for a cut at the standard rate, they would take me ASAP.  Nobody was in the joint and they refused to take my Livingsocial coupon until after 7pm.",0
"Tempe Beach Park - such a gem in our landlocked State...

Sure, it's a man-made water source, and yes - it's pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but it's gorgeous during the day and at night too!

I've done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park, and most recently, I did the PetSmart Walk (go team Yelp) that took place at the park as well... 

With the proximity of the park to ASU / Mill Ave, it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon - no matter what's going on there...

My only words of wisdom - don't swallow the lake water!",1
"Very well done pizza...its like a pizza pillow, tasty, savory and rather doughy.

This is not my favorite style of pizza but nonetheless it was especially good pizza.  The service staff was top notch and the store is very warm and inviting.

We will be back!",0
"Hit or miss food. I ordered the meat plate with corned beef, zuch and asparagus for the sides. Corned beef was WAY too salty, and same thin style you get on a sandwich. I sent it back for a chicken breast bone in, which was the driest chicken I have ever had. The side veggies were good (perfectly grilled no butter), and accompanied by garlic bread. I think this place has potential but I ordered wrong. I sat at the bar and service was mediocre. Price was pretty low though. Good place to watch the game.",0
"At the ripe old age of 3, it's time for my previous review to take a siesta. Over the course of that three years, Tempe Camera's only gotten better. The selection's improved (finally finding a happy medium between film and digital), the prices are even better than they were, and I dare say service on the retail side's kickass too.

TCR is now my go-to photo supplier as a working pro. They've either got what I need or can quickly get it, they still know their stuff, and they support both local photographic education and the local photo industry. They're also the only dealer in the Valley that sells Think Thank Photo products, which are best damn professional camera bags ever.

And if you're an amateur, they've got plenty of friendly, knowledgeable staff for you too. Don't be afraid to ask for someone else; like almost anywhere, they employ people of varying personalities. There are sales staff I don't click with at TCR, but I wouldn't classify anyone as distinctly rude. (If you want that, you'll have to try B&H or Adorama.) If you need lots of hand-holding, the ASU crush probably means you'll either want to shop at off hours or go to Photomark--TCR tries, but the crowd to counter ratio just isn't favorable at peak times.

Repairs are still something they do very well at excellent prices. When I've had equipment serviced, it's been turned around quickly, relatively inexpensively, and works like brand new. Evaluation of your equipment is still free, as it should ideally be at every repair shop (but often isn't).

The lab's added a bunch of cool new services, including damn fine plexi mounting, and is doing a considerably better job with film than their old reputation for free scratches with purchase would suggest. Hundreds of frames processed with nary a scratch to be found.

Rentals I'm a little more ambivalent about.  They've thinned the herd out considerably (about half the rentals inventory has taken up residence in the used equipment case) and the selection of lighting equipment is basically unchanged, but they've got the latest Canon and Nikon bodies, and everything's well-maintained and in good shape. Rates are good for what they do have--the question's just if they have what you want.",1
"Love Oregano's :) 

The 45 minute wait for deep dish pizza does not bother me much because I know I am going to get it just the way I like it. Lots of pepperoni and easy sauce. The BBQ wings are so good. They are crispy, hot, and bathed in sauce. Service at Oregano's has never failed me. In Tucson, AZ and in Phoenix, AZ service is great :)",1
"What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.

Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.

I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.",0
"This bar reminds of an old pair of pants. It fits. Not too tight, not perfect. Just kind of fits. There's some holes in the knees, and its a bit faded. It's certainly not perfect.

Mulligans is that bar where you can go and kick it with your friends. You never know what kind of people you are going to run into. Co-workers, drunkards, bottle rats who got kicked out from other places.

The drinks are cheap. The beer selection is so so. The bartenders are pretty nice, but aloof. It's just an average bar though. Nothing great, nothing bad.",0
I love Dr. Scott!! He is the funniest doctor I've ever met and he makes me feel good too! Dr. Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible. The massage therapists rock too! I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic.,1
"I love the lakes!  Yes it's a lake in the desert!  Dragon Boat, Outrigger, and Marathons!  It's the place to do it.  Not sure about the fishing part, but I do see people fishing there.  What are they trying to catch hmmm??  I enjoy running there on a nightly basis and so should you.  South side is probably the most scenic, but not to say the North side is bad.  If you're a fellow photographer I would definitely recommend this place during the evenings :)",1
"So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D... She has a wicked 8-10 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis. Well, I was happened upon an opportunity... Nay! A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and, being the attention whore that I have been labeled, I accepted.  I won't go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest, but it involved a House of Clubs, Twitter, and a whole lot of begging (on my part)...

There I was... in the presence of 100% pure, raw (Can't decide which word to use ""Talent"" or ""Creativity"") and in a pretty bad ass studio. The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nation/world and stumbled on numerous great ideas. One being a cure for cancer! Okay, we didn't discover a cure per say... but we did briefly talk about it.

The listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional, yet extremely comfortable. Plus, we actually got some free talent from a caller! He was awesome and sang me happy birthday.  It was sexy.

Thanks for a great time, Amy and KWSS! You rock, alternatively!",1
"This is a cool place for low key hanging out, killing time, chatting and relaxing with friends.  It is NOT a good night spot and doesn't work as an event venue like they seem to be trying to make it.

I've attended 2 events there and its basically a disaster in trying to make your way through the 200-300 patrons they bring in.  You get funneled in past the food trailer into the bar area which is packed with people standing among several oversized tables.  Only if you've been there before can you figure out that you can walk towards the boxing ring past the crowd to get behind the stage and into the retail area.  Once there you have to get a spot among the wares to watch the back (or the side) of the show that is going to take place facing the bar.  Both times I stood the entire night with my drink next to a display of $50 t-shirts.  Very nerve wracking and annoying.

1.  The old timey way they make drinks is very cool and the drinks are delicious but I have waited now 35 and 45 minutes each on different nights to actually get a single mixed cocktail.  Its insane how slow it is.

2.  There are rules to what you can get at which station.  One spot is just wine.  Another spot is just mixed drinks.  Lemonade - oh thats a different place entirely.  

3.  They use the boxing ring as the ""stage"" for shows.  Very hard to view the show there because of the odd angle its at.  Both times I've had to stand in the retail area while the performers faced the seating/bar area (which only seats about 75 people).

To pay more than $10 to see a performance at this place is outrageous.  If the owners want to be an event venue they could do it simply by doing some rearranging and investing in some more seating.",0
"Glorified panda express

With that generalization aside I was willing to give ol PF Changs another try when they served me a steamed shanghai shrimp dish that was devoid of flavor

Thinking less flavor meant a healthier meal I alas was given a shocking reminder of how this place sodium bombs there dishes when I read the nutritional info

 'tear",0
"I liked the tortillas:  handmade, rich and salty.  I thought the food was decent.  I thought service was okay.  I am not new to Mexican food, I know what I want:  when I say I want cheese and cilantro and tomatillo salsa,  please give it to me.  They charged me and extra dollar for had smattering of queso fresca.  Boo.  I liked the mango-pineapple aqua, super sweet and clean flavor.  I would go back, maybe.",0
"The place is a hole in the wall right behind the PHX car rental center. Arrived at dinner time, and had the best Mexican food! I had the #5 Machaca Plate w/rice, beans, & one of their homemade tortilla's burrito style. It was just amazing, and so cheap ($5.65). The only issue I have with this place is that its very well used, and looks very dirty, I did find it a bit sticky. Maybe this is a better place for pickup.  If you want a clean restaurant, their North restaurant on Cactus Road restaurant is much cleaner.",1
"Cracker's & Company has always been a favorite breakfast destination. The food is always delicious and the selection more unique than other restaurants. My husband and I came in for a quiet Anniversary breakfast and although the place wasn't terribly crowded, we were seated right next to a table of ill mannered children and their mothers. I would have asked to move but our waitress was missing in action from the start of our visit. Before our waitress went MIA we ordered our drinks and entrees. In the past I have been given a small carafe of coffee but was only given a cup today which was disappointing. I ordered a carrot cake muffin when I ordered my entree and asked to have it served right away with my coffee. I also asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side of my ""New Princess"" omelet but it was spread over the top when it was delivered to my table along with my muffin. So much for enjoying my muffin with my one cup of coffee.  However, the food was wonderful as usual. The service was horrible and the ambiance was equally as poor. I'd hate to see a wonderful restaurant such as Crackers lose their edge in this competitive food service industry. I'm hoping today was a fluke and the service will improve to its previous caliber.",0
"went back to the cork and experienced the fall menu. i am afraid that my second experience was not sa good as my first. the service was great,the resturant beautiful,but the food did not make me say yum yum with each bite like my first visit. 3 of us had the rabitt risoto and none of us really liked it. the scollops were great the fig salad was ok but the duck was so over done it was like power and way too salty. the creme brule came it was about 3/4 a cup portion $6.00 that was rediculuslly too small of a desert for $6.00 get real CORK i am afraid this will be my last visit. there are too many choices . Like Roy's Hawian Fusion Cusiene , Roy's is more cosistent and flavorable and mor reasanablly priced sorry CORK",0
"Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend. 
The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table. 
Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking. 
RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu. If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat!",1
"We were very disappointed with this place. We drove over to Tempe, to a blasted out, deserted shopping center that looked like it closed due to a depression, and there it was in the corner, still open while everything around it was closed. It's a nice little spot inside, comfortable enough.

This is another one of those places that thrives on the Groupon phenomenon. Prices are jacked up to accommodate a discount. I bought a $6.50 bottle of beer (as one example). My pizza, a sausage pie, came out burned. I know that a good pizza has a ""flame kissed"" look to it, even at top places like Bianco's. But this pie was flame-licked, and there's a difference. I tasted charcoal more than I did sausage. 

The folded and stuffed Calzone was not burned, but neither was it stuffed so full that it's busting its seams which is the way we like it. Lots of air inside this Calzone. I'lll take the dramatically less expensive Calzone at Mama Mia's on Indian School any day over this hot-air filled version.

The service was good, with a very friendly waitress helping us out. She should have noticed the burnt pie, however. If they reduce the inflated Groupon prices, I'd go back when they bring in some reasonable draft beer and start putting more care into their preparation of the food.",0
"I'm not a coffee snob, but I love a good Americano.  

This place has the charm you'd expect from a locally owned coffee shop complete with  eclectic decor, artwork on the walls, odds-and-ends of gaudy lamps and stained-glass windows.  The coffee is pretty good from what I have experienced.  The air-conditioning is right where it needs to be as well. 

Most important factor for this business:  very nice staff.  That alone makes me want to come by more often.",1
"I moved to AZ a few months ago from NYC, where I lived in a neighborhood of great Vietnamese restaurants, and have eaten my way through the Vietnamese enclaves in Boston and in Hong Kong -- and this place ranks up there with the best of them. You can tell how authentic a Viet place is by the condiments when you order: the right kind of basil, mint leaves, and limes. This place has all that correct, and their fish sauce is perfectly seasoned: not too sweet like some faux-Viet places, and just the correct color/taste. I'm lucky that it's down the block from my new home, and I can run in whenever I want. The pho is right-on, with really tasty and rich broth, and I also love the noodle cakes with grilled beef. 

Only complaint is that I find the price to  be slightly higher than what I'm used to in NYC (of all places!). But it's only about $1-3 off per entree, and I understand it may cost more to get their supplies to the desert.",1
"My friends and I were in Arizona for Dodgers' spring training a few weeks ago and were at the mercy of Yelp for finding things to keep us busy at night. After talking to a few of the bartenders at Bobby C's Lounge (LOVE THIS PLACE), which we found on Yelp, they told us about Char's. On a Sunday night, Char's had live music and a packed dance floor. With an awesome mix of Old School Funk, Reggae, Classic Rock, and even a little Santana action, the live band was ON POINT! We were singing and dancing to every song! The crowd was fairly diverse and everyone was friendly. I could definitely see this as a relaxing place to go after a long day, where you don't necessarily have to wear ""club attire"" to fit in. The vibe was very chill and the drinks were great. I'll definitely be coming to Char's the next time I'm in town. 

GO DODGERS! :)",1
"Andrea is absolutely wonderful. She's pet-sit for me several times over the past several years and I've never had a single issue. On her first visit she stopped by to meet the animals and go over details with me. Now I just call her to let her know the days I'll be away and she arrives without any problems. 

She's very responsible and trustworthy - her copy of my house key broke off in the lock and she called me right away and we figured out a solution. She even came by on a day she didn't have to in order to get it fixed - all of this while I was gone.  On another occasion my travel plans changed suddenly and she was able to continue watching my animals. 

I highly recommend Andrea as a professional house-sitter. She can't be beat.",1
"Worth a visit. This is good food, not good people watching. 

Think: Colorado take on southwestern food. 

Ate: Pork Green Chili app. Grub. Little kettle of the stuff with four fresh made tortillas that arrive folded in a white paper bag - hot. 4.7/5 for flavor, quantity, value, and presentation. 

""Big Ass Burger.""  All made in house. Even the bun and fries. I don't think they keep the cattle there though. Burger was loosely packed, over-cooked, and a bit salty for my taste. But I am a critic. Jen thought it was average too. Also now $13 - was $10 6 mos ago according to other reviews. 2.75/5

""Huckleberry Bread Pudding.""  Whoa. Like a hot gooey berry muffin with Ice-Cream. Awesome. Jen thinks it might be her favorite dessert of all time. 5/5

We were a little worried when we saw all the snow-birds in their ivy caps and studded mom jeans. Turned out to be just fine - and the service was pretty special for how reasonably priced everything was. Portions were serious - Jen and I shared everything and were stuffed. Can't imagine orgering your own app, entre, and dessert. No way. 

Sorry about the typos. It's bright out here in the Scottsdale sun by the pool...",1
"I am *floored* that this place has 4 stars. Literally fell out of my chair, picked myself up, then continued on to write my review. 

The staff is friendly at this restaurant - I'll give them that. It's relatively clean and has decent prices. That's where any positives end. The food here is absolutely disgusting. Nothing has any flavour - no flavour at all. None. Nada. The salsa is peppery water at best, the beans are mush, and the rice just tastes like plain white rice. I had a ground beef burrito, which I'd think would be difficult to mess up... Nope. Not for these guys. The beef itself was unseasoned burnt 80/20 ground beef. There was at least 3lbs of sour cream. And for God's sake -- even the ""cheese mixture"" had zero flavour. I've eaten better pizza boxes. Pass on this places, dudes.",0
Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.,1
"Met my friend Jackie to grab a cup of coffee and ended up staying for hours!  It is a great place to relax with comfy seats and a great vibe.  We plan to go there one night after a movie to sit and relax while listening to the live music.  Very cool.  They have delicious sandwiches and their baked goods looked amazing!  

The baristas are so nice and helpful and very friendly.  The place is modern and inviting. They offer so many organic healthy choices.  It is located in Norterra close to the Harkins Theater.

Glad she suggested this place ~ we will definitely be back.",1
"Video Paradise is great.  For those who aren't financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account, or when you don't feel like buying something from Amazon.com, Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know won't be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video.

The selection is staggering.  I remember the first time I stepped in, I was amazed.  The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn't have was The Helstrom Chronicle, but that's okay.  I'm not going to ding this place because they didn't have it.  ""You didn't have The Helstrom Chronicle?  Lame!""  I mean, come on.  No one else has it.  

This place had it all, from little indie films to gross-out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence (Cannibal Holocaust, Faces of Death, etc.).  They even had the worst movie I'd ever seen in my life:  Hard Rock Zombies.

The décor is that of sheer, unbridled love for cinema.  You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection.",1
"Are you one who likes the smell of a brand new car? How about the smell, or in this case, lack of smell, of a brand new gym? Now, for a limited time, a completely unsullied 24 Hour Fitness, at the MetroCenter, of all places.

At its current new state (it's been open for a week), this 24 Hour is in much better condition than the one on Camelback. No surprise there - everything inside here is brand spanking new.

The details:

* In contrast to other 24 Hours in the Valley, this one actually will remain open 24/7 (versus closing at night on the weekends). The guy at the front desk said this is due to how this location is zoned vs the other ones.

* The cardio area is equipped with 11 flatscreen TVs hanging from the ceiling, with one even tuned into soccer-centric GolTV (which means one less tuned to all those talking heads on brainless cable news stations - bonus). 

* The adjoining weight area is larger than the Camelback location and currently has all its dumbbells in place on the correct shelves, and all its weight machines are working. No new types of machines, though (this is a 24 Hour Fitness after all) but still all the standards, plus four flat benches and four incline benches.   

* Full basketball court (which could also be split into two half-sized courts). Camelback lacks this.

* Large stretch/ab area which also includes some contraption straight out of Tron/Blade Runner. I stood there and looked at all the diagrams, acknowledged that it must be useful, and walked away.

* Standard group X classroom, childcare

* A spotless pool area. If you've been to many 24 Hour Fitness, you'll know that this is a hugely appreciated factor. I anticipate it's not going to remain spotless for long, but doing laps in a crystal clear pool was awesome. No dankness here (yet). 

* Spotless lockerroom with wood-paneled lockers and branded Dial Ultimate Clean hair & body wash. I'm assuming the women's lockerroom has their own corporate soap sponsor (I find all this a little odd, but go figure).  But beyond soap, there's some contraption called SuitMate which is like a salad spinner for your swim trunks. Just throw your trunks inside it, press down, and in 30 seconds your trunks are water-free. How awesome is that?

* Is going here after work safe for your car, you ask? Well, when I left the gym two hours later at around 9:45 pm, my car was still there in the parking lot, untouched. Seems like the MetroCenter is full of surprises.

* All in all, a great gym that I'm sure will be a welcome addition to the area. However, it still rates 4 stars since:

A) Although all the equipment is brand new and the latest edition of everything, there is fitness equipment at other gym chains that this one is lacking. 

B) I'm anticipating what the gym will be like in 6 months. If it manages to stay as clean as it is now by that time, maybe a 5th star will be in order.",1
"I went for brow threading.  Yelena was extremely gentle and took her time making sure they were perfect!  I just found my new ""brow lady"" and she's just across the street from my office! LOVE IT!!!  Give her a try!",1
"Had a fun UYE get-together with Brian S. & Norm R. today to give this little Venezuelan cafe a try.  I had a Carne Esmechada Patacon, which is a sandwich with slices of plantain for the top & bottom, fried crisp.  (A plantain is something like a huge banana.)  Inside was a moderate amount of shredded beef & some other things.  It was good, but it cost $6, & for a full-sized meal you would have to add a couple of other things in the $4 range, & end up at about $15 for your lunch!

For half the price, I would give it twice as many Stars.",0
"This place never ceases to amaze. One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. The Sicilian scramble is a favorite--though the smashed meatball was great. We finally went back for dinner the other night and for the first time I had a burger. It should not be surprising that is was fantastic. Atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is great--just go!",1
"Yes, the view is wonderful. Absolutely. 

Sadly, my table was near the entrance, limiting my ability to enjoy said view. Also, we are still in the summer months, so I was confused that there was a fire raging outside at night. 

The decor is wonderful, dark with different tones and moods. We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass. Not everything has to be practical art.

Our party consisted of five and we were certainly treated to a good sampling of what this place had to offer. Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. 

I was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. 

The desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.

The service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low. I understand that drinks are open to a bartender's whim, so I won't dwell on this fact.

Valet had a bit of trouble with our car and keys, which was annoying.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience, food and atmosphere alike. However, the service did bring me down a bit.",1
"I almost don't even want to write a review for this place. It's so near and dear to my heart and I basically live here that I just don't know how to NOT write a novel of a review for this place. So I'll attempt to bullet point my feelings on the joint:

A. Friday Happy Hour - need I say more? Pretty sure all the homies would agree that we've spent thousands of dollars here over the years. You're welcome Lodge. 
B. Cheese Curds - FRIED cheese balls and ranch. nuff said. 
C. Best server ever, my homeboy Michael (you guys need to give him a raise. I haven't seen him around much lately and I'm pretty sure that's why I've been at Kelly's more recently)
D. Black-outs
D+. I have a scar on my left knee where I ate shit playing cornhole. How do you eat shit playing cornhole? No clue. Probably because of the above point listed above. 
E. Lodge stimulus package - $6 for a can of PBR, a shot of nasty ass whisky, and a cigarette. BEST DEAL IN TOWN. Pretty sure the ex got nice and hammered a few times off this lil package - great deal ladies. Get your man sloshed and then take advantage of him. Always a good idea. 

The only reason why there's not 5 stars is sometimes when you sit on the patio, it takes about a year for a server to come around. Best bet it to hunt one of them down and start a tab that way. 

Oh The Lodge. Such great memories here...and most of them are just hazy bits and pieces.",1
"Wow-- SO many breakfast options I had a hard time deciding what to order.  They've got skillets, scrambles, and omelets galore.  Not to mention two baked pancakes that sound amazing.  I'll definitely be back to try those.  

During my recent visit I went with the New Mexican Skillet, which consists of eggs, chorizo, avocadoes, cheese, and tomatoes served over nice crispy hash browns.  The chorizo was well-seasoned and not too greasy.  I appreciate that they have the options of egg whites or Egg Beaters, although I dislike the up-charge!  But you can't put a price on health (says the woman eating chorizo and hash browns).  The fresh-squeezed orange juice was delicious.

Portions are huge here.  Supposedly the skillets have two eggs, but I think I got more like 4, and the scramble at another table looked like it had about six.  Even though the place was full, the service was excellent.  Just know that you may have to wait a while for a table if you go on a weekend.",1
"-1*

Dropped in for my 3rd visit & still no menu board or the other offerings that made them different....no cupcake, boba, etc.  Tried the pistachio fro yo & it had an artificial after taste.  Guess I'm driving back to Yogurtland for now.",0
"Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. Healthy, hearty and great service. It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but I'll still patronize this place. Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order. I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - there's something about being by the lake that makes it special. Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time. ;)

Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer! :)",1
"I LOVE this place.  Great food at great prices with great service in a great atmosphere.  Great variety, great spices, great presentation, great menu.  Every entree gets a cornbread dish skillet to nibble on.  I think I would love everything on the menu.  Can't wait to go back and try them all.  Love It!!",1
"short, fairly easy hike but not well labelled/marked!  i went with a friend who had been before so that's how i knew which way to go.  even then, we both got lost trying to find the parking lot!  easy parking in the zoo parking lot - you can see the ""hole in the rock"" from there so just park on that end of the lot.  just a short walk down a paved road then some light terrain up the hill.  not a hard hike - i did it in flat sandals.  great photo ops at the top!  

we went on a weekday so there were very few people around but my friend says it gets crowded on weekdays.  also, no water fountains and bathrooms in sight so take care of all that before you go!",1
"I love this store.  The produce is always fresh, they have an interesting selection of frozen items including some great appetizers, the meat department is outstanding - I've tried a few different kabobs from here (spicy kabob rocks), bakery is great, nice selection of hard to find dairy items like fig yogurt, fair cheese selection including a local fresh burrata and mozzarella that will knock your socks off, excellent selection of wines and craft beer, and a floral department that has exquisite arrangements.

Aside from the above, they make great sandwiches, have a nice salad bar, have different take out dinners available every night, have a pasta night and will make you a fantastic iced tea or an iced latte that rivals any chain.  They also have an awesome grill - they will make you a kobe blue cheese burger that is out of this world.  The hot dogs are delicious but they are gigantic (and a little unsettling to look at).

One piece of advice before you go, not everything turns over quickly so check the dates.",1
"The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix, hands down. If you haven't been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out.",1
"No need for a long review.

Every In-N-Out I have ever been too has been amazing.

Great Food
Great Customer Service

Love this place",1
"This place gets an A for effort, but I think it falls slightly short. It's neat/cute that the wasabi is actually blue, and some of their rolls (like the pink dyed rice for the Marilyn Monroe roll) are innovative, but the food is only a little above average. I liked the rolls okay, but the best thing I put in my mouth was the shrimp tempura appetizer in the martini glass. That appetizer is to die for! The miso soup was pretty good, but not my favorite. We did like the fact that there were only a few tables and it wasn't a huge place with a million people, but the food just wasn't what we expect. We are going to continue hunting for our favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale.....the service here was very good, though, which made the experience pretty pleasant overall.",0
"My daughter loves this place, unfortunately they ran out of money and are closing currently.",1
I discovered this place by going on one of my usual 20 mile bike rides along the canal until something cool popped up. I sat outside and sipped a nice chamomile tea as the first rain of winter fell unleashing an amazing scent. The staff was top notch and I was delighted to see several tannat wines from Uruguay on the menu. I can't wait to return some evening to share a bottle of wine and tapas with my girlfriend.,1
"I've only had a baguette once but never again, it almost made my gums bleed!

However, ever since they opened I've been a fan of their most delectable croissant sandwiches. Great prices and awesome drinks. Suckks they don't take card but still worth it.",1
"Been here for many years but have seen a recent decline in quality service. Felt scolded by the bartender today at lunch. Felt disrespected as a customer. Service sucks stay away. ""bad service = bad review""",0
"are you joking? Where else can you get the best salami, ham, any cold cuts anywhere? I just moved here 6 months ago and have been searching for a place like this. Their meats are fantastic. I discovered this place after driving by it so many times. thought I'd take a chance. Location is awful. but worth the trip.",1
"I love this place! I have been coming here for ages.
My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, china's little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!",1
"Possibly the creepiest convenience store I have ever been to.  I mean, it's sandwiched between a strip mall and a giant dirt lot.",0
"I love minimalism.  If you can class up a place with a less-is-more approach, then you've exceeded the abilities of 95% of the American population.  Fortunately for the Cen Pholks Lisa G has this aptitude that transcends through her decor and into her simplistic, but delicious organic food.

Now, here's my deal: you put prosciutto on your menu and and I'm gonna get b-boy on your hardwood floors like Ozone in Breakin' 2.  Lisa G's breakbeats the hell out of their prosciutto sandwich with caramelized onions, parm cheese, fig jam, and arugula on an Italian loaf.  A side of balls and their Alamos Ridge Malbec and I'm fresh.

Service?  Never had a bad experience, but who cares?  The food outshines any flaws of a young dine-in.",1
Still flying solo.  My friends took me for dinner here and it was excellent.  Humus appetizer was great.  For main course did broiled chicken pita wrap and it was perfect.  Recommend!,1
"Good food, decent selection, open late (for you partiers), decent delivery time.",1
"I have come more and more to appreciate some of there beers that I use to not be a fan of.  I tend to like some of there seasonal's more then there regulars. I'm a big fan of there oatmeal stout and there bourbon barreled porter and pumpkin porter.  

 I spent most of my college career randomly showing up here for family dinners, reverse happy hours, 21st Birthdays and everything else in between.  There happy hour is pretty good with discounts on pints and pitchers, but I really wish they would add food to it.  There food is good, I have yet to find something I didn't like on the menu.  Overall, great place for dinner or even to hang out on the patio and have a few beers after a long day.",1
"When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries. Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out. Luckily for us Mikado is literally a 2 minute drive from our house. :)

The restaurant is low-key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience. The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable. 

So anyway, on to the sushi! I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura. The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it's so ginormous. They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce. LOVE! And while I'm on the subject, Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura. Their tempura shrimp is super crispy, isn't greasy and always fresh out of the fryer. The Crunch Roll is superb, the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious. Their prices are great and you still get so much food. How can you go wrong? If you're within a 20 mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by.

Also, I can't say this enough: Please support your local businesses! They depend on your patronage!",1
"Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's. 

I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity.

Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm. 

Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it. 

Bottom line is 5 pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment.

Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that.

Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price. 

Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's. 

My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce. 

Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise. 

Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh.

So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison. 

Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there.

Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling. 

I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing. 

I totally hate goldfish, too. At least share that in common.",0
"I didn't have an outstanding experience in this place.

Breakfast was typical and service was rushy.  

Solid 3 stars

Biscuits were yum",0
"The Capistrami is the best thing ever.  Hot pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw and a russian dressing.  I'm addicted to this sandwich, but of course, there are worse vices.  This sandwich screams 'eat me' even when I'm completely full.  It's okay, the pain I feel later is justified by how amazing it tasted earlier.  They have a good selection of chips and also make fresh baked cookies.  Service is on par.  Love it.  If I had to pick one gripe, the bread could probably be a little bit better, but that's minor in light of how great the food is here.",1
"I came here a few weeks ago and I really loved it. I thought it was great that most of the ingredients were vegan and vegetarian friendly. My husband and I came here for breakfast. I had a strawberry banana smoothie and my husband had a chocolate, coffee peanut butter protein shake to die for. And we had bagels that were very tasty. I would love to come back here for lunch, everything sounded excellent, especially the soup. I was also impressed with the staff....I thought that was the best feature of this whole place. They are super friendly, and this one guy, was SOOOOOOOO Funny the way he was greeting people and making jokes. It was very outgoing and it made the customers feel like they had been coming there forever even if it was their first time. It also makes patrons and business owners feel like they are an important part of the community with the camaraderie that takes place here. I am looking forward to returning.",1
"The Chuck Box is dark. Very dark. Even in the day time it feels like night in that place. This doesn't help when it comes time to put condiments on one's burger. I am skeptical as to how well the condiment bar looks in good light, which may explain the choice of lighting. Still, grinning and bearing it, I load up my veggie burger with appropriate toppings and, usually with fried zucchini in hand make my way to one of the very uncomfortable seats.

Every time I go to the Chuck Box I feel as if there is going to be something wrong with the food, and this something is being concealed from me by the lack of lighting. Yet, each time I go I have a delicious veggie burger or grilled chicken sandwich. My friends have also enjoyed ""real"" burgers there as well. 

Maybe it's best they keep the lights dim, but the food tastes so good there may be nothing to fear after all.",1
"Bizarre. My family of 5 came here for lunch one day, to see what all the hype is about - and boy did Hana fall FLAT! I personally had no expectations and Hana still missed them. 

Before seating us at a LARGE table (there's maybe 10 tables in this joint), this obviously inexperienced hostess first looked unsure of where she should seat us (the table for 2 or for 4?) She then proceeded to rearrange the table for 4, and moved ALL of the chairs around the table to add 1, instead of just adding it to the empty space on the end of the table.... odd.

And then our waitress.... was really abrupt and ungracious about things. My sister's accompanying salad was half covered in lettuce rust - and when she showed the waitress, all she said was ""so do you want it?"" Uhm, no thank you, I like my food fresh, not rotten, but thanks.

The sushi was pretty much the same thing covered in different sauces. Annnd they were pricey. it was kinda sorta really unbelievably ridiculous. RIDICULOUS, i tell you! Not worth it. No way. I'm quite sure that the ""crab"" was imitation. And the fish wasn't even that fresh. Granted, we're in the middle of a desert, but still. 

The one redeeming quality of this place? The ramen. Although there were about 10 noodles in it, the pork was perfectly cooked. And it would have been nice if the chef had been a little less stingy with the ramen noodles. 

Would I come back? Uhm.... only if I had no choice and was craving ramen. But for sushi? Save your money, go to Yen and get muuuuch better quality AND quantity.",0
"I still like Lux better. Cartel is very appealing, though, to those who know their coffee. The menu is not huge, but it does offer basic, good drinks. 
They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if that's what you're into.
I like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel ""art"" is pretty interesting and unique.
This place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here. 
The employees are funny and nice. Anyway, it is definitely worth checking out.",1
Love Krista!,1
"Special. Not on menu. Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette. This was THE best salad I've ever had, and probably top 5 best meals in my life.",1
"My daughter and I really enjoy eating here. We tend to order the same thing every time because it's so good. She gets the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo and I get the grilled salmon nicoise salad. They both rock. It's cafeteria style all the way up to the point you pay, then you are served the rest of the way by a waiter who brings you your food and takes care of you. The food is always very fresh and delicious. And by the time we're out of there, it costs no more than eating in the food court but the experience and quality of the food are miles beyond. Highly recommended.",1
"Wow, this place is still here? I went there as a girl (15+ years ago) with the family on a regular basis. If it's still around, then it MUST be good!",1

"Cartel is my go to coffee place.  If I could drink here everyday, I would.  The barista who seems to always be working sunday mornings makes the best lattes that I've ever had, ever.  Each one always has a cute little heart or leaf shaped on the top which obviously is their secret as to why they're so delicious.  I've never gotten anything else because I've already discovered the best.  If you're cool, you probably like to hang out here on the reg.    
I definitely recommend, best coffee in Tempe by far. 
It's a little hard to find if you've never been before, right off university on ash across from the circle k.",1
"Came here last night with the girlies to satisfy our craving for Indian food.  We've talked about this place for a while, and I'll be damned if I was leaving AZ before stopping by this place!  So luckily, I was able to convince one of the girls that finals are not as important as saying goodbye to me over a plate of curries.

We got their around 8 and the place had a good crowd.  We were the only white girls, so we know we were in for a good meal.  Going over the menu took us a while, because one of the girls had no clue what she wanted, and the server was polite enough to let us take our time.

Before we figured out what we wanted for dinner, of course we had to figure out drinks.  So we all order and still continue to peruse the menu.  Then our drinks came out...huge plus for this place right here, they were huge!  My gin and tonic was in an oversized cocktail glass and my friend's Chardonnay was filled to the brim.  No skimping on alcohol here!  The waiter advised us the drinks were strong, which I was fine with but my girlfriend needed 3 more limes to take hers down.

We finally end up decided on dinner, with the shahih paneer, chicken saag, and vegetable korma, and an order of garlic naan.  I was a little unsure about the paneer, but my girlfriends swore by it.

When the food arrived, we were excited!  Everything smelled so flavorful and the naan was huge, good thing we only got one order.  I loved every single bite I had at dinner, and the feeling was mutual across the table.  All of us ate beyond the point of feeling full, but we couldn't help ourselves!  This food was too good!

Luckily, we were able to stop ourselves and save some food to take home.  I got the chicken saag and I am so excited to have some for my own brunch.  Mmmmm...I'm getting hungry thinking about it now.

Overall, $20 a person including tip, with strong drinks, good food, and extras to take home we were satisfied.",1
"My wife and I have made two trips to Roberto's from Dana Point, CA (400 miles) and we haven't been disappointed.  Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.

My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.

She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast. The bread, light and toasted perfectly, hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers), and if you like, guacamole.  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee, or if you have never had Jamaica, a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers, try it.  Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.

Oh, and by the way, the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.  If they are eating there, you know it's good.  Just had to thank them for their service.  

This is truly a restaurant where family meets family, Roberto's and yours.

And for you insiders, we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.  Although they're not on the menu, we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.

I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure), but they don't last.   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location, we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.

During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.  But, fortunately for us, they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.

These tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.  Check with them to see when they're available.  They're really worth the extra effort.

Although Roberto's delivers, I regret that they won't come to Dana Point.",1
"When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.  The previous tenant/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.  Defalco's was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!  

First off, it's not just a deli, it's an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  It's also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now we've moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Don't forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.  

My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  I'm a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  It's always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads I've had in a long time.

It certainly won't take me another four years to go back.  I think I've been there just about every week in the last month!",1
"Oh, Sushi Brokers...what happened to you?! This used to be my go-to place for great ambience and delish sushi.  We ate there Friday night for the first time in a long time and they have significantly raised their prices and the sushi was subpar at best! $90 for 3 rolls and 3 cocktails. Grrrr....frustrating!",0
"1 star for service and attitude.The food was delicious , but the staff was very hateful. I am writing this review. I don't remember the waitresses name but I do remember that she was short , hispanic , and she was pregnant at the time. She was incredibly hateful.So hateful and rude to me and my parents. I do know why she did this is because I am transgendered. I was wearing leggings and I was carrying a black polo purse. 

So I thought that this happened because of how I was dressed and how I looked , but that really wasn't the case.I went back 2 weeks later and I dressed differently. More ""manly"" (ha). Different waitresses , same great food , same hateful attitudes. I will stress to everyone reading this to save your time and money and go to a different pizza hut or a different pizza joint to get better service.",0
"A girlfriend and I have been meaning to check Bombay Spice out for a while but have never gotten around to it until last night. (I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) 

We ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.

We both had wine, the ""single glass"" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)

Neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!

We also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. 

I will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. 

There are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free.

Good experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal.",0
"Love Bagel Nosh! The staff is so friendly and of course the food is delicious! I have to admit that the pumpkin latte was no Starbucks pumpkin latte, but the pumpkin cream cheese was amazing! ( I do realize it's no longer pumpkin season, I was just wishing I had some anyway) It can get busy on the weekend mornings, esp since the bike shop opened up next door, but I find it well worth the wait! (Oh, and fyi it closes at 2:30 - so get your coffee early!)",1
"If you are in need of any kind of battery Batteries Plus is the place to go. They'll test your current battery for free, upon request, and I haven't found a battery that they didn't carry. They'll even replace the batteries for you in watches for free. I take all my watches to them rather than to a jeweler who is not only going to charge me for a battery, but will charge me for their labor as well. I even buy my regular batteries here because often times they are way less than at the grocery store.",1
"I had a great experience.  Nice people.   My minnie poodle mix looked great and was happy when he came out!   Total bill: $43 + tip including cut, blow dry, ears,  toenails, anal glands and teeth.  Located in the Goodwill parking lot. 

This is my first dog, and my first experience with a groomer.  I called on a Saturday and had to make an appointment for the next Saturday, so they are busy.

I asked the front desk guy where the price/package list was.  He said they didn't really have a 'list' so I told him what I needed and I wanted to know how much it would be.  He went in back and the groomer came out to take a look at him and talk to me.  She quoted me $38 and I asked how much for teeth, she added on $5.  They gave me a guide to determine how short I wanted him cut and asked me specifics on what type of cut (I said shave him, it's summer).  they asked about ears, tail, etc.

I brought him in at 9 and they had me pick him up at 1.  I don't know a lot about grooming yet but they said depending on how he was under the blower he might need to be kennel dried.  When I came back at 1 they were finishing up his head.  I can imagine he might have been a tough client, given that he is still puppy-hyper and not yet accustomed to the spa treatment.  He was blow dried for sure; His former curly hair was completely straight and soft.  

The shop is no frills.  No pretty sign out front and no decorating inside.  I think they could make more money with some product around or maybe charge more if there was a little more spa feeling when you walk in, but I will go back again for sure.  

My poodle mix is 6 months old and this was his second cut.  (The first was done by a family member).  My poor puppy went in looking like a mess and I didn't recognize him when he came out!  He was soft, had a nice cut and smelled great, even his breath!",1
Fantastic place to have a vacation..love this place. Close to shopping too...,1
"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender.",0
"After watching her win on Cupcake Wars I was determined to find this place (It's very well hidden)and sample the cupcakes.  I have to say I was not impressed; i make better cupcakes on my own.  More creative and not so sweet you'll go into a diabetic coma.  i did have a California BLT as well and it was a good sandwich although the bread was a little too toasted for my liking.  The staff was friendly, the ambiance was very pleasant and it was clean.  But the cupcakes...really not all that.  Sorry....",0
"Boring.  Uninspired.  Generally sauce-less, which means the meat courses are plain and dry.  The salmon tastes like styrofoam.  The filet is flavorful but they use low quality cuts.  The veggies are simply steamed.  No doubt the options are healthy, but at the sacrifice of flavor.  When I pay this much to eat out, I want to taste it and enjoy it.",0
"A great place to experience some unique and innovative dishes.  The Stetson Chop, of course, is the highlight of my Cowboy Ciao experience, as it tends to be for many others.  But I've also had good luck trying other things on their menu, such as the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry, a less expensive alternative to the entree version.",1
"We arrived on time however our table was not ready. Offered a place in the bar but was told we cannot order for 30 minutes?!
Somewhat bizarre thing to be told. Had a total of eight dishes, some were fantastic, others mediocre. Despite  the fact that they are the hot new thing, a customer should never be told that they can't order for 30 minutes. That exudes arrogance. Cocktails pretty good. Might give them another chance.",0
"Best cajun food in town, not just from a truck.  Phoenix doesn't have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito.  They have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering it's from a truck.

The spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing that's going to harm.  I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice... not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling.",1
"I've been to the Greene House many times. In general, I think it's pretty good. I go mostly for lunch, and I order from the sandwiches & salads typically.Tonight was no different - had a sandwich.

I went with my brother as a belated bday celebration. Ordered the roast beef sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. Had the pineapple rum cake for dessert.

The first few times I ate at the Greene House, I was really impressed. I thought the food and service was very good. Over time, I've become less impressed. Tonight, the service was great - loved my server. Everything worked like a well-oiled machine. Good coordination between the staff, and we were kept well supplied throughout dinner.

The food is not consistent. That's a big issue I have with restaurants in general. Maybe I'm harsh, but I really believe being inconsistent knocks a place down a few notches. The problem with inconsistency is that you don't know what you're going to get. If a place is consistently mediocre, at least I know I'm going to get mediocre.

Tonight the real downer to the whole meal was the salad. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was not great either - bun too big compared to the amount of meat and other filling items on the sandwich, not enough meat - but the side salad was really awful. First, if I moved the salad on my plate, there was a big pool of dressing on my plate. There is such a thing as a properly dressed salad, and this was not it. Way too much dressing. I might have been ok with that had the dressing been very good... which it wasn't. The balsamic dressing was too sweet, and was under seasoned (definitely needed more salt).

The dessert was good. It wasn't great... but it was good. The rum cake, in my opinion, was too dry. Maybe the ridiculously large scoop of gelato is supposed to compensate for that, but I'd prefer a more moist cake and less gelato. I'm also not a huge fan of places where the dessert is almost as big (if not bigger) than the entree. Give me a couple bites of something amazing rather than a huge plate of something mediocre. I felt that this dessert fell into the later category.

I'm going to admit that this is only the second time I've ever had dessert at The Greene House, so I won't pass judgement on it's entire dessert menu, but I'll say the couple times I've been there, the dessert/entree ratio was way out of whack for my liking.",0
"Got the chance to go out with the wife and WITHOUT the child, so we decided to go here after reading about Beckett's Table in the paper.

A lot more casual than I was expecting, but not necessarily in a bad way; I just assumed that being voted into the top 5 restaurants in the city, the place would have a touch more snooty-factor.  Kinda like an upscale, family restaurant if that makes sense.

I started with the creamy grits and schreiner's sausage trio.  I have to say it was my first time for grits.  Solid dish, I may prefer polenta to grits, but this dish was done really well.  Wife went with the brussel sprouts.  Very tasty, but strange to see as an appy - thought it might be more of a side.  Seeing as they're not on the menu anymore, it doesn't matter.

Mains: I had the Short Ribs and my broad had the Cast Iron Chicken.  I was blown away with the short ribs - they were indeed fork tender, as I didn't lift my knife once for this plate.  Great flavourful mash with the red wine reduction.  Truly a great dish.  Wife's chicken was great as well.  Smoky, tender chicken with the incredible stuffing.

Bacon cheddar biscuits were ordered, but we had to take them home as we were both stuffed.  A little dry, but good the next day, however.

Service was rushed in the beginning, as our waiter asked how are meals were, but was gone before I could answer.  He was in the weeds though as it was hella busy for a while.  He made up for it later in the meal.

Dessert: wife had Nutella pudding and it was adequate. The coffee creme brule on the other hand was outstanding.  Thick and rich, and packed of caffeine.  Good finish.  Oh, and good cocktail menu too.

Will return.",1
"This mall is HUGE for a mall this big I think they should have more directories but nope they want me to get lost in this mall.

This mall has plenty of stores and a bunch of designers, you can probably find something for everywhere here whether you want a coach bag or a bag at forever 21. I especially loved how the Sur La Table here had a cooking class going on and you can see the kitchen as you walked around the store. There were plenty of food options and so many stores here that it was easy to get lost. There was a windows store here which is a big plus since I have never been there. Even though I personally didn't find anything here for me there was still a big wide variety.",1
"First off made a reservation and arrived to be seated next to the extremely hot rotisserie.  Very uncomfortable, not to mention it was 112 degrees outside that day.  I asked to be seated elsewhere but the hostesses' excuse was that this was all that was available due to reservations.  Well I made  reservation but she just made another excuse that we needed to be a larger party to sit elsewhere.  I gave it two stars only because my family likes their BBQ-I don't.",0
"I've always wanted to go here.  The flames outside intrigued me.  So we went on Wednesday night around 8pm.  We were sat fairly quickly with no reservations for habachi.  Music is pumping, and the crowd is a bit older/slightly cougarish.

The service was...OK. He went missing from time to time.  He brought me a diet coke after I had only taken a few sips out of my glass.  I must of gotten 4 new glasses by the end of the meal.

Soup....is your basic mushroom miso soup.
Salad...Tasty, spicy, had a nice kick.  Fresh crunchy greens.
Fillet and Chicken....Eh....I found the flavors lacking, the steak a little chewy, and the chicken boring.  Even the dipping sauces were lacking.

74 for dinner plus tip for two.  I think you can get better elsewhere.  Not worth the drive down to Scottsdale, find a local joint closer to home.",0
What can I say - I love this place!  I was introduced to it by a group of 20 something friends so I was a bit worried going there (I'm no longer of that age group.)  Turns out I had nothing to fear!  Roosevelt is perfect for a glass of wine with the hubby or post dinner cocktails with a group of friends.  Still have a the munchies after dinner - there is a great food menu selection as well.,1
"Wow...  I regress into some sort of '90s Valley Girl stereotype when chirping in delight over how good Switch is! How I was missing  a review for a Short List restaurant that I recommend to ev-er-yyyyy one I meet who is new to Phoenix and even remotely cool!?

Switch is reliably good food served in a reliably good atmosphere by reliably good servers. The combination of service, setting and grub makes Switch a go-to for affordable dining that has appeal for a wide variety of people. If I think that someone might be too uptight or too culinarily 'safe' to really enjoy Fez I know that I can take them to Switch, they can hone in on comfort food basics and I will still have an enjoyably awesome dining experience myself because all the basics are done with love, care and actual effort. 

I think I prefer Switch's menu to Fez's because of the combination of classic choices mixed in with flavor play and more diverse fare. And we end up at Switch a lot because they have awesome outdoor loungey space which works for friends who are smokers and for a quieter, more intimate chic and cool dinner-drinks and gossip night. 

It's really a gift to have this place in Downtown and a real gem in the Valley overall.

We have on occasion had our asses kicked by the bar, specifically by the Drunken Italian Sodas which are so very, very good!",1
"Did you know that Malee's on Main offers cooking classes!?  They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year.  I attended two weeks ago, and it was OUTSTANDING!  Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which, incidentally, it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces), but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes, served tastings, a meal, and wine pairings, and we were even given goody bags.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!",1
"What has happened to the Coffee Plantation? I've been out of the Valley for 8 yrs. and the Coffee Plantation was always such a good place for food, bakery items, and of course coffee. On my last visit the store was dirty, the full menu of food was gone, and the coffee was burnt. I went to the Biltmore and alas that location was gone. Where did my old Coffee Plantation go?",0
"I don't know why i have been here more than once, but the parking is horrible, and the food is only so-so.  lots of color and flare but not much going for it.  the baja sauce is great but i seem to get sick later that evening when i eat it.  i need to learn from experience",0
"I absolutely love the food here!  The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to.  This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable. Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open. 
You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!",1
"We had a fantastic experience here! We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June. The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60. For Scottsdale, this is a steal! We shared an appetizer and a main entree. The appetizer was delish. Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus. Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter. For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach. Fantastic. The service was also great. 

I've come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasn't! Maybe we were lucky, but I enjoyed our experience.",1
"Saw this place while I was picking up pizza for my kids.  I didn't want pizza thought I would go in and give the tamales a try.  I haven't regretted that decision at all.  The chicken tamales are the BEST!  They are super spicy, the way I like.  The beef with red sauce is great too, not very spicy at all.  The masa in all the tamales is flavored wonderfully.  I am hooked on these tamales.",1
"The consummate beer bar.  Great selection, knowledgeable bartenders and eclectic patrons.  What more can you want from a drinking establishment?  The food is good too.",1
"Zipps is a rocking place with TV screens in all viewable angles. The atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like Monday Night Football. Smoking is outside because this place is around the Tempe border. The service is great and the food is even better. Try the chicken tacos!
Good times had by all!
Check it out some time!",1
"Ok....my 2nd review of an ""Irish"" pub.  And we're getting closer.  Good ambiance - I really thought it looked much like a few pubs I visited in Dublin (tho no pictures, that I saw, of the famous revolutionaries, no flags, no old photographs.  But a good draft beer selection.  And a really good Irish menu - we had the fish sandwich and the banger sandwich (lunch menu) which included chips (french fries) and I ordered a side of curry dip for the chips.  Good stuff.
Good Irish music (cd's) playing in the background - not obtrusive.  And a very good wait staff.  The bartender greeted us the minute we walked in. But sorry, folks, music is Thurs thru Sat and no Irish music that they admitted to - cover bands instead.  So I'll keep looking, but I'll stop here when I'm in the neighborhood.",1
"Roka Akor has a classy atmosphere, and a slightly formidable menu to pick from. Everything looks so good, and in a new environment, I want to try it all! But my date and I, after much deliberation, decided to ""go for broke"", as it were and if we couldn't finish, at least we had a good sample of the menu. 

 For an appetizer, we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad. These were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly. The butterfish was delicate, and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors, and not that ""generic clump of lettuce"" flavor I hate.

 From the sushi menu, I was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before, so I ordered the wagyu gunkan. My date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh-so-chivalrously gave me his piece. It's true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served. The wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree - which I wasn't expecting, and I thought the onion was a bit much.

 At for the skewers we ordered, my date liked his sweet potatoes the best, but I was partial to the crispy BBQ. These turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice, run through with a skewer. Pure white sushi rice in the center, the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet BBQ sauce that comes on eel sushi, which gave the whole thing a nice, crispy shell.

 At this point, I got to what I consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal: the yuzu marinated black cod. The cod, cooked on the robata grill in a leaf, was meltingly soft and delicately flavored. It was an effort to be share fairly. I believe my date said after our first taste of it, ""Just eat what you want and I'll finish ..."",  I looked up from my chopsticks, ""... you know what? Just cut me off half.""

 I wasn't sure that I could handle dessert after eating so much, but we finally decided it wouldn't be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over, right? So we ordered the baked green tea custard, and it was a perfect pick after a gut-busting meal. Light and airy, it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as I was eating it. 

 Our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh, at least to my taste buds. In order starting with least harsh: pineapple, honeycomb, raspberry, and apple. I didn't like the last two, but the pineapple was, in my mind, a fairly dangerous thing to drink when you're not paying attention. Smooth.

 That's it for the food, and as for the service, it was swift and considerate; glasses were kept full, and empty plates whisked away. There was, however, one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness. The waiter, who had up till this point been very nice and chatty, helpful about menu items, and generally a pretty cool guy, handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying. 

 What am I supposed to do with this? Are we going to call our waiter up and say ... well, what? It flummoxed me.",1
"Very good traditional breakfast spot. I stopped in just as they opened during the week to make sure and grab a spot.  I was treated with a really tasty plate of eggs and peppered bacon.  One of the biggest pluses, Matt's actually knows how to cook hash browns, I didn't need to order them well done, they come nice and crispy as is.  The real show stealer is the toast and home made jam.  Nicely done breakfast at Matt's, go grab some!",1
"I was told to see Greg after a local shop diagnosed my exhaust problem.  He took a few minutes to look at my car, told me what I needed and what it would cost. I went back a week later, he did the work in the time he told me it would take and there was no surprises and my car is doing well. I would recommend this place over ANY muffler shop. Plus you support local business and not a chain.",1
"This was my second time dining at this Benihana (not my first teppanyaki experience), and we were out for one of my bf Sarah's birthday. We had a 7:30 reservation, and were seated at around 7:40 (why they make reservations, who knows?). 

There were six of us, and another couple was seated at our table. One of my gripes with this style of cooking, is that the dining space is super tiny. With all of our drinks (one each) at the table, there was hardly any room for error. Either way, our server was super nice and took very good care of us. The meal was good, albeit expensive, which is what one should expect when going to Beniana's. Everything was cooked great though, very fresh and yummy. This is definitely a place that you come for the experience as well as the food.",1
I would rather go to Benihana to be honest. I have been here a few times because its so convenient but has never been worth it in the end. I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it. I have not gotten sick from the sushi here but lets just say I didnt feel so hot after eating here the last time. I looooove sushi and its hard to say that I wont be back here but I'd rather drive a bit farther and skip running the risk.,0
Awesome staff. Great prices. Left feeling relaxed and refreshed. A must try.,1
"Of the 3 sites - this is the Kindergarten.

My daughter is attending here and I simply love it.  She's five and is repeating kindergarten.  She attended kindergarten last year early at the encouragement of her preschool teachers who thought she was bored in their classes.  We are having her repeat because she's a little young for first grade, but this isn't an issue because the curriculum rolls every two years for that very reason.  

In her first year - she learned to read, write, do simple math, know all her sign language letters, and has more Spanish knowledge than I do.  this year they will build upon all of that and take her further.

The staff is great and care a lot about the kids.  And when issues arise they  work with the parents to get them solved both at school and at home.

It's pricey. But so very worth it.",1
"1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again, ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back.",0
"Terrible food. Pretentious service. Stale bread brought to table. Mole was grainy and tasteless. On the upside, great tequila selection! At least you can get loaded and pretend the dinner you just waited too long for and paid too much for was worth it.",0
Where else can you get a Chile Relleno wrapped in a tortilla to make a burrito? Super crunchy friend goodness with oozy melty cheese in every bite.. Oh the overkill and love every second of it!! Jen Red Pork in a quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice.. this is some serious hybrid comfort food.. may sound strange but works very well! You'll leave super stuffed and change in your wallet from a $10!,1
"The Sushi was fab!!  We had some specialty rolls and Shashimi, both were very melt in your mouth fresh!

Service was a bit slow as I think they only had 2 waitresses for the entire place.

Cost seemed to be very reasonable.

Would certainly make the drive from South Scottsdale there again!",1
"You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head? Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.   Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years, this place is great!!!  

I would say this is the best non-Pizzeria Bianco/Cibo pizza in the valley.  The crust is awesome, sauce and cheese just perfect!

The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made.

The lobster ravioli were huge, easily enough for two.  Baked Ravioli's were better that average but needed more basil or something.

You really can't dine here, so it's take out or delivery.  They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could.",1
"I just went here for the first time with my boyfriend this afternoon. I got a Green Apple Snow and he got a Mocha... Blast? or something like that. We both loved them. While the drink was amazing, what was even better was the quality of their boba, they weren't too hard or squishy and they had the perfect taste. 

The shop was really clean and nice and cool. I also noticed they had battleship and I think checkers and some other board games out for customers to play with. They also had a computer monitor I am guessing for games. I didn't go to look at it. I think there was music on but I can't remember.

The service was really fast, but then we were the only ones there. You can't use a debit/credit card for an order under $10 so we ordered an extra drink for our friend we were going to visit. We asked if she could make it when we were ready to leave and she was really nice about it. 

I can't say one bad thing about it. If I find something else on another visit I will update. As of now this is going to be my number one place to get boba.",1
"Huge fan of Bikram yoga! It's a 90 minute, torturous-at-times, sweat-filled  workout but when you are done, you feel insanely amazing. The feeling continues throughout the day leaving you in complete zen....Road rage? Gone. Annoying food cravings? Zero. Jeans? Fitting awesome. You really must try it, it can completely change your body.

There are a few places in the valley that offer Bikram, most of them exclusively rather than in combo with other methods of yoga. The Bikram Institute on Miller and Indian School is where I first tried it, and I like it the best so far. They offer classes throughout the day and later in the evening as well. Like other studios, this place offers first timers a week-long pass for around $20. What I really like about this studio is their instructors and the fact that they keep their room darkened throughout the entire practice. I've have been going to another studio lately (for their first-time student deals) and their instructors bark out instructions non-stop plus they keep the lights on the whole time. So when you're staring up lying in your relaxed state, your eyes meet the glare of the fluorescent. 

I'll very likely return here after I've exhausted the new student deals at the studios around the valley. Yoga can be expensive!",1
"Is there a way I can give LUSH an extra star???

Pros: Friendly & enthusiastic staff, incredible products, lots of samples, phenomenal smells, reasonable prices, and get this, an HONEST company!!! Read their bag, it'll make you love them more.

Cons: if you're sensitive to smells, brace yourself.  Also, if you're the type that wants to be left alone while you shop, beware.  The staff is excited about their products.

Don't miss: R&B hair moisturizer (it drives men crazy!), Coalface facial cleanser & Brazen Honey exfoliating mask.",1
"Called last night @ 4:30 and tried to do call ahead seating for 6:30 for a party of 9. We are in town and are here to see some friends. Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation. I was told to call back in an hour, the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they weren't that busy yet. So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldn't be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths. I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do. I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements. She said ok and that was it. Nice job Texas Roadhouse. NOT!!! There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place, like Open Table. One day there will be no customers to disappoint, then maybe you will get it.",0
"Lovely shop, great cupcake selection, friendly service.  But the real question is...how do the cupcakes taste???  Pretty good.  I tried (4) flavors and they ranged from OK to YUMMMMMM!  Vanilla with chocolate buttercream was ok, the Coconut was good (a bit dry, but decent flavor), the Carrot was very good, and the Mocha was YUMMMMMM!   They were all super sweet though.  My husband and I both had a quarter of each flavor and that was more than enough.  

From a flavor variety and taste perspective, Sprinkles is a 3.5 - 4.  However, I really can't justify spending $14.00 for (4) cupcakes.  They are expensive so they can pay their overhead and lease costs, not because of exotic ingredients or special decorating skills.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they use good ingredients, but the wrappers are plain, there's no special piping or fondant work, and the flavors are standard. They are just plain good cupcakes...not fantastic, but good.  Certainly not worth $3.50 a cupcake.  I do a ton of baking and I get special order requests from friends and neighbors all the time.  I always do nice decorating and use premium ingredients and the most I charge is $2.00 a cupcake...and that's only if I use fondant.",0
"The food was excellent ... the service not so much. 

A colleague and I took one of my clients here for a business dinner. The atmosphere was great, the food was outstanding but the service was embarrassing. 

It was a fun, Arizona type feeling restaurant and made quite the difference for my clients who are originally from Scotland. 

I had the roasted shrimp and grits. The grits were the best I have ever had (sorry North Carolina!). The shrimp portion was amazing. The dessert was great. I was surprised to see the offering of huckleberries. 

Sadly, the server forgot quite a bit of things. My client's wife ordered a second glass of wine to have for dinner, which was forgotten. We also asked for corn bread - the server forgot and brought it with our dessert. He tried to explain that it is made fresh to order and that is why it took so long.",0
"I met up with a friend for dinner here the other night. It's a little far from me, unfortunately; if this was within a few miles of me, I'd be here a -lot-.

  For starters, the place is easy to miss. It's a hole in the wall. It's very small inside, only a few tables; definitely consider takeout.

   That said, if it's not busy, don't be afraid to stay. We ate in; when there was a significant lull in the crowd, the girl behind the counter came both to clear our tables and to deliver a second item I ordered a bit later in the evening. I wish I'd been carrying cash, there is a tip jar by the register, and I would have loved to have left something for that.

   The food...ah, the food. Great bang for the buck. Have I had better tacos? Yes. Once, handmade by a Mexican immigrant my mother was good friends with, as we joined her for a family dinner. In restaurants? No. This is good Mexican street food, small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful, moist meat on them, and some warm salsa on top. Lovely. They even offer lengua, for those that like it, a very nice touch.

   As others have said, the rice is very good; I wasn't actually that fond of the beans though.

   Is this place worth going 20 minutes out of your way? Unfortunately, no, hence the 4 star. But is it worth going to if you're already nearby? Yes, very much yes.",1
Pancit palabok here is best outside of the Philippines. Anyone can enjoy a quiet peaceful dinner on a Friday night,1
"Today was my coworker's birthday and this was his choice for lunch.  All in all it was pretty good, some place I would go back to.

The chips and salsa - the chips were nothing special, but the salsa was very good - both a green and a red one were served.

I ordered the enchiladas suizas, beef, with green chile.  They were pretty darn tasty.  The beef was a little dry, this was the only drawback.  They had great flavor.  I even finished the rice and beans - which I rarely do.

I get very disappointed when I order enchiladas and I get a plate that is swimming in grease and/or enchilada sauce and/or drowning in cheese.   None of that happened here, which was fantastic!",0
"I came, I Kiltlifted til the wee hours, caught up with a friend who was in town for a few days and staying nearby. Decent enough bar, was able to talk above the music without yelling, no asshatness witnessed and they have Kiltlifter. Service was attentive, a team effort, yet a bit robotic. They seemed a bit overstaffed, and well , just bored. Did I mention the Kiltlifter?",0
"When you walk into Sky Harbor, you are bombarded with declarations that it's the country's ""friendliest airport"". Huh. What does this mean? User-friendly? Friendly in a ""you'll always feel at home here"" way? Didn't really know, but it seems extremely important to their PR group, since when you sign on for the wi-fi, you can't change pages until you rate how friendly the airport is from a drop down menu. 

It might be doing a disservice by proclaiming it as the superlative of congeniality. Expectations run high -- at least by me. I found the free wi-fi extremely friendly. Yeah!! Star for that. I found the den-like check in area (at least in Terminal 3), not so friendly as it left me feeling a little depressed. The TSA officer who confiscated my 4 oz (apparenly it's 3.4 oz in PHX) Neutrogena sun screen not so friendly...but not malicious, and I guess I wouldnt be so friendly if I were charged with monitoring tenths of ounces hour after hour. The spoke-security system I found to be not so friendly to both users and retail. I never like seeing a plethora of places to purchase items BEFORE security, leaving you with only a few outlets for you to browse in your little concourse. I hate wondering, what do gates 1-14 get to purchase? Is my concourse more vacant than the others? Just put security before ALL the retail and let us wander a bit. 

Overall, not a bad airport. at all. the friendliest? i don't know, but the free wi-fi certainly made me leave with a smile on my face!",0
"Being the B, L, and D (breakfast, lunch and dinner) restaurant of a major valley resort takes allot of versatility. From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. 

With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. 

In the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. 

A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. 

The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   

Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. 

Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean. 

While Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub.",0
"This place is fantastic. Great food, superior service, gorgeous decor... I had a Breakfast Casserole and a generous side of Cheesy Grits. My girlfriend had the Blue Plate Special which was a frittata. 
The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg. There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors, and I didn't see any extra oil in the dish. It came with a side of toast. I chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick. The grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top. The grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me, as I prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum. 
After breakfast I ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish, a really good balance of tomato to booze. I liked it a lot. What I liked the most, though, was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server, the hostess, the bartender, the bar manager, the valet drivers, and even being greeted by the concierge and check-in when we weren't even staying at the hotel. I will definetly make it a point to come here again.",1
"Come on now, let's call a turd a turd on this one.. Waterfront is a stretch, its a canal, a stinking fucking canal.. leave it to the Scottsdale developers and planners to put a Scottsdalian slant on the turd.. kudo's to them! However, with its chain stores and restaurants on one side and pretty lame so far on the other (Southbridge) this has become quite a giant and over priced turd. 

Those skinny Scottsdale bitches that hang out at Pink Taco, words of advice.. Fucking eat something!",0
"Shoes, and purses, and make-up - o my!

Your sales totally RAWK guys!  I mean, seriously - 50-70% off (gotta catch it just right, people) and then, an extra 30% off that?!  I feel like a wild thing, you make my heart sing.

OK, now today, the most I found was 40% off - B U T - then there's MAC!  Oooooooo, ya baby.  All that glitters is NOT gold.  (ok, it's the small things...)

It was still fun to look at all the purses.... And mark some for future reference.  Hey, I am a patient person.... I stop for red - tags, that is.",1
"I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp! wants me to give at least one. 

I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad, we didn't even get to try the food! 

True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the ""bad service"" , but I paid more attention to the ""Cheap"" and  ""Delicious Pho"" reviews because after all, you can't knock it til you've tried it. Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isn't as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho I've  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited. 

It was around 6pm and the place wasn't busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register. 

After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasn't about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant. 

We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you don't either. Just as it isn't acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isn't okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I don't care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals. 

Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House. I don't need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food. I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night.",0
Loved it! Best French toast ever!,1
"I have visited MacAlpine's a few times, and every time I have been very pleased with both the food and the service.  The wait staff and the owners are always very friendly and helpful and the food, although nothing fancy, is always good.  I love the atmosphere of this restaurant as well as the neighboring thrift shop that is fun to browse while the food cooks.  And the egg cream sodas are delicious!  Not to mention visiting a piece of Phoenix history at the same time - I love it!  The only downside to this place? I wish they were open later into the evening...",1
I have been here multiple times and each time the staff has been superb.  Their selection is also awesome.  I would highly recommend.,1
"Yelp pointed me to this place while on a business trip-- looking for good pizza in the area.  Kind of a mixed result.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall, sort of hidden in one of the back corners.  Walk in thinking fast food, but turns out it's sit down.  Why does it seem all the burger and pizza joints in this area are sit down-- odd...  Anyway, I got three slices.  Quality was ok-- a bit doughy and filling, I couldn't make it through all three.  Lots of free refills was a nice touch on a 105 degree day.  Staff were really friendly, and, oh yeah-- it was cheap!   Less than 6 bucks for more pizza than I could eat and bottomless coke.  So, great value, nice service, just ok pizza, though.",0
Other restaurants have come and gone but this one has been there like what my wife said about 20 years existing in the area. Congratulations!!! I loved the old recipe sourdough pizza. I enjoyed it very much. Neighbors please help our local business survive. We need them to support our local community.,1
"I went here for happy hour with a long time friend. I wanted to try something new and Switch totally fit the bill.

First off, their happy hour is A-mazing! I had two glasses of white sangria that were just perfect. 

My friend and I shared the cheese and fruit plate because it was on special. It was nice to try everything, and since it was on special it made everything taste better.

For my meal I had your traditional cheeseburger, and it was very good. I had half to take home which made for an excellent lunch the next day. 

The only thing about the place that was a little strange was the crowd. I expected for having such an awesome happy hour it would be busier, however it was kind of dead. I even saw a group of people be seated and abruptly leave. It was kind of strange. Perhaps it was just an off night. This is definitely a place I would go to again!",1
"I don't think I've ever been to this place when it's not been crazy busy. It's just a small little eatery, but it's always busy. They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious. Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at. Parking isn't the best and that is a problem, but if you live close and can walk, its ideal.",1
"You know, I've read some mixed reviews on this place. I enjoy going here. I think the pricing is reasonable, and I haven't had bad service. The food is pretty good (in comparison to other Phoenician Sushi restaurants).",1
"Step back into the 1990s and enjoy a workout! Nice clean facility. Equipment sort of jammed in at odd angles (in the large weight/cardio room) but its good stuff. Not sure the purpose of two weight rooms. I think the club is more tennis based yet they have do have group exercise classes, racquetball courts and a pool. 

I think the spinning room may have been a children's nursery at one time based on the wall graphics, the black light effect is unique. If this were my club I'd place the emphasis on spinning classes and convert the smaller weight room into a spinning studio. 

Dropped a star because the women's locker room doesn't have a sauna. 

Very friendly employees! I am so glad to be greeted with a smile when walking in the door. Everyone on the staff is friendly. Quaint club. . . in a good way.",1
"A big shout out to Mike, the stupendously stellar bar manager.  I will be back to discuss the history of Vodka.

Thank you to restaurant GM, Anibal, who stopped by to see us not once, but twice.  Enjoyed the education regarding the secretive life of truffles. 

Aaron, the fantastically knowledgeable Sommelier, had me paired with excellent wine suggestions with only a few hints of my picky palette.  

Appreciated the Manger of Stone Rose, Sam,  coming all the way over from the other side to dropped in and sat with us to chat about upcoming events.

Can't wait to go back to try out there new bar bite menu in 2 weeks, and take advantage of the locals' secret  1/2 off bottle night on Tuesdays from there amazingly huge book of wines to choose from.  

Thanks again everyone: you made a potentially disastrous date night from visiting an establishment previous which (to say the least) did not go well, into a very enjoyable and fun evening.",1
"Pita Jungle is now one of my favorite places to go for dinner. It's both affordable and healthy. Thought it's usually  crowded with ""Hipster"" ASU students, I have yet to receive bad service. Our food has usually come out in a timely matter.

As for the environment, It's very nicely decorated with art from local artists and it's very well lit.  It's nice and open so you can see what's going on through out the restaurant. It's never to noisy, so it would be a great place to take a family or even a date.

Almost every visit, I've always gotten either the Broiled Chicken Salad or the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. The chicken has always been moist and dish is always flavorful. The lemon vinaigrette dressing is almost good enough to drink!  Though I have not tried a lot on the menu, some of the food they bring out always make me say ""Ooh, what's that?!""",1
"Agree with most posters about the setup - left much to be desired.

I was smart and arrived BEFORE 4:00 P.M. so I could jump in early for some short and FAST lines.  My 15-yr-old son was with me, and he's a fairly picky eater, which was one reason I brought him - so he could see that there are other foods he might like if he TRIED them.

I got a lot of food between 4:00 and 4:30, when the lines were short.  I probably got to try 10 trucks before we left at 5:07.  We went back to some trucks more than twice or three times when we found something we liked.

My advice for future events:

1.  Help the trucks deliver the samples FASTER.  Not sure how - maybe get them an extra staff member?  But the samples on some trucks were coming SLOWLY, so that needs to improve.

2.  Better location, maybe not on dirt, and maybe a little larger.  Once the lines got up to 20-30 people, the going was CRAMPED and it was taking a long time to get your samples.

3.  Maybe a lower price for tickets?  Seemed kinda steep for the amount of food each person received.

All in all, I enjoyed the FOOD, but the rest of the logistics, not so much.",0
"I have been to Butters on numerous occasions - the latest being with three senior golfing friends from out of town.  Over the last few years, we have tried numerous breakfast places on their trips, searching for a breakfast that would satisfy all of their different tastes.  After trying six or seven different places, I brought them to Butters, since it was on our way to the golf course. 

We all ordered something different, including a skillet, bacon and eggs, pancakes, and an omelette.  The service was fast, and friendly. In fact, we have one picky eater, who always sends his bacon back, because it isn't as crisp as he demands.  The waitress handled his grumbling very nicely, and even had him laughing about it.

The atmosphere is somewhat trendier than Butterfields, which was a very big plus for my senior friends.  They also commented on the friendly service, and the reasonable prices. It didn't surprise me that when it came time for breakfast on the final three days they were here, they all voted to come to Butters for breakfast.

It should be noted that we came on the weekdays when it isn't as busy on the weekends. I have been in the area on weekends, and it always appears that there is a waiting line.

The only thing keeping it from more stars, are the hash browns.  They are obviously prepackaged (or at least taste that way) - and a real breakfast place should have signature hash browns.  But all in all, a nice addition to the area.",0
"Food was delicious, portions were great, and price was very reasonable! Highly recommend",1
"The boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday morning hung over from Four Lokos. 

The food was fucking great and I don't even like breakfast food.  I got this egg and jalapeno burrito thing with this sort of runny but generally pretty tasty salsa and I wanted to shower in the burrito filling.  I would have bathed in eggs and salsa if only to prolong my experience with this semi-breakfast burrito thing.  I would have married it and had kids with it and bought a house in Michigan nearby a really good school district.  I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.  

It was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks (is that part of the required uniform I wonder?)

I'm deducting one star for the sheer fact that this place was filled with rich, middle aged white yuppies talking about golfing and/or glued to their cell phone.  The boyfriend and I, being young dirty Mesa kids still slightly intoxicated off Four Lokos, felt mildly out of place in this setting and were a little over whelmed by the amount of yuppie whiteness.

Nonetheless, the food was worth the trip and the cozy patio on a Sunday morning was a nice change from, you know, Cheerios on the futon while watching exercise equipment infomercials.",1
"We stopped in here on a hot summer afternoon, grumpy because we had been on a wild goose chase for mint. Couldn't find it anywhere, like Fry's, Basha's, or TJ's, even in those teeny tiny overpriced little packages. They have it here in big bunches for something ridiculous like 59 cents. Since we had friends coming over for mojitos, this made me happy! It's just about mojito season again, so I'll be headed back to this location. The produce section was large and had some good-looking stuff in it. The location isn't really too scary.",1
My wife stayed here while transitioning to Arizona and enjoyed her stay. The hotel seems modern and they are currently renovating the place; so far so good with the improvements.,0
Awesome pool.,1
Love this place...can't beat it for a healthy meal. Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese.,1
"Best Thai food for your dollar in the entire valley. I'm no Thai expert, but I have been to at least a dozen here in the valley. Keep in mind - this is NOT a fancy place - just a simple, inexpensive, casual dining experience. WOW!",1
"The Boulders was a first class experience all around.  

We stayed in a casita, which was one bedroom and had a sitting room w/fireplace (a letter on the table indicated they are no longer using the fireplaces for environmental concerns), a large bathroom and walk-in closet, and a patio with a table and four chairs.  For the ladies, there is a vanity with lighted mirror just off the bathroom.  My only small complaint about the casita was that the shower was a bit small.  The mini-bar seems to be a thing of the past, but the Boulders still features a well-stocked version with a half bottle of Cali wine, kettle cooked chips, water, soda and various liquor.  The villas were outrageous and would be great for a family reunion or that type of thing - multiple bedrooms, a large outdoor area for entertaining, with the garage (they're houses, really) converted to a bedroom.  If you're staying in a casita, it's a hike across the property to the villas - they'll take you in a shuttle bus.

The bar near the dining room was well-stocked with several single malts, and the standard cigar list.  Walk out back through the seating area, and you'll find the pool, framed by a gorgeous backdrop of a large boulder and waterfall.  A little cool for the pool in December, but it didn't seem to hamper others' enjoyment.

Looking forward to returning and enjoying more on-site amenities besides golf.  My girlfriend went to the spa for massage / pedicure and seemed pretty relaxed - what I gathered is that she enjoyed it.

There are places with cushier accommodations, but the property it sits on is what makes the Boulder's unique.",1
"This is a huge improvement over the last bar that occupied this spot. They obviously put a few bucks into the renovation and added pool tables. The rub is that when a band is playing here it totally dominates the conversation, and if the band sucks...  

Please put in a smoking-friendly patio, right now customers have to stand by the parking lot sans drink! They have another less-noisy bar in the front, which I was pleased to discover was offering $1 well drinks from 9-10pm for guys -  we took full advantage.",0
"Just great! The gluten free pizza crust is really good. Be sure to order it crispy otherwise it can be kinda chewy (unless you like chewy, then order it however you want). I really dig the BBQ Chicken pizza but I think that they might have recently changed the sauce or something. It's tasted different to me the last time I went. If they haven't changed the sauce, then I *COULD* be loosing my mind. Either way, it didn't taste as good this time around. Just saying",0
"Food is good.  Service is pretty good.

Its a restaurant that definitely reminds you of LA, as it is very loud in there.

Definitely will go back.",1
I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.,0
"If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life, it would have to be at FnB. This is ultimate comfort food for me - with the bulk of the menu highlighting local in-season organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms. Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning, contrast, balance and temperatures. 

Beyond vegetables, the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite. Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind - ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect. Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time.

Service is professional, attentive and friendly. Pavle and his team make you feel right at home, which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday.",1
"I've heard about this place being ""the best"" burger joint so i had to check it our for myself. My boyfriend and i went on a saturday afternoon and to my surprise most of the seats were taken, people were coming and going so my first thought was they must be good since they were so busy. Severs were really nice and prompt.

we both ordered their 1/3 lb arizona smashburger which has: habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipolte mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun, we also had an order of their smash fries.

first thought, the presentation of the burgers and fries looked great, after putting mustard and ketchup on it and TRIED to pick up the burger everything almost feel out. It was messy and greasy totally ruined the experience of enjoying the burger. It tasted like any other burger, nothing really special about it. Their fries however were amazing. 

on a scale of 1-10 i would give this place a 6 just for the food presentation. my boyfriend said he wouldn't go back but i'll give it another try one day.",0
Love this place. Great Happy Hour.,1
"Taste buds went CRRRAAZZYYY!!

Finally made it to the much raved about Pizzeria Bianco and happy I did. It was absolutely delicious. Thankfully we made it at a good time where we didn't have to wait at all for a table (YES!). I ordered the Margherita and was deliciously pleased. However, my sister opted for the Biacoverde and boooy was I jealous. It was awesome and my favorite by far.",1
"Barrio Cafe is a favorite of mine, the margarita's before you get seated are a must.  When in season the pomegranate guacamole is second to none.  A refreshing escape from the cookie cutter chain restaurants.  When you go go with friends and don't have a schedule as the wait can be long, but worth it.",1
"This is place IS Beer Heaven!  Over 100+ taps of amazing beers! This is the ONLY place I will purchase [several] beers at full price, not on happy hour. 
Amazing thing #2 ~ (for the girls) they have a ""shorty"" glass which is a 9oz glass instead of 12oz, it is a beautiful thing! Now I can order two different kinds of beer without getting overly full (er bloated), instead of the two big 12oz glasses! 
Amazing thing #3 ~ The food is delish!!! My boyfriend and I split a burger. Bad idea. It was so good we really didnt want to share it afterall ;)
Amazing thing #4 ~ The staff are awesome! There are several staff behind the bar and ALL are happy and willing to help you if your initial server is MIA. They are very attentive, friendly and helpful if you can't decide :) 
Amazing thing #5 ~ The atmosphere is awesome and the music they play is great!",1
"Went in for acrylics on Friday and it was horrible! I've been getting acrylics for years and it has never been a problem to have them filed down...until this time. The tip of one finger was filed down so bad that it's blistered. (At least the nail tech put some antiseptic on it so it's not infected.) Also, when I put some lotion on my hands Tuesday a lot of my nails started getting sticky and filmy like they were going to disintegrate. NOT NORMAL! I removed mine today and found that my nails were finely filed, so it looks like they would have fallen off soon anyway. I'm not going back there again.",0
OMG this place is good. Great Italian beef. Great burgers. FRY SAUCE. I don't know how they're pulling off such good food with what they have but it's awesome and I will be eating here if I'm in the area and hungry.,1
"As far as the sandwiches go, the place is fine but just thought I'd mention that if you are trying the broccoli-cheddar soup late in the day you may find it ""overcooked tasting"" bordering on acrid and burnt like we did.

I guess they assume everyone is going to order a $5 footlong because pricing for six-inchers is not quickly established by looking at the overhead menu.",0
"I am a transplanted Midwesterner, so I love me some breakfast.  And by breakfast I mean:  Hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy.  

Mike and Rhonda's makes a mean breakfast with huge portions.  For $7 you can have bacon/sausage/ham with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and biscuits & gravy/pancakes/toast.  Come hungry or share.

They also serve classic american lunch fare:  burgers, chicken strips, fries, meatloaf, etc.",1
"The hubby and I stayed here on our wedding night. We didn't arrive until midnight or so (we partied late :)) and the service was still impeccable. After our car was valeted and we were golf-carted down to our casita, we were left to enjoy our night of solitude. The room itself was beautiful; king sized bed, fireplace, patio overlooking the golf course, vanity, ipod dock, jetted tub, separate shower, and plush robes and slippers. 

We ordered room service probably close to 1 am and it arrived promptly. The boy ordered the veggie wrap (he said it was delish) and I ordered the tossed greens salad with balsamic. For $13 the salad was a total miss. Just a few mediocre lettuce leaves, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers thrown on a plate. I was hungry though, so it worked.

The next morning we slept in as late as we could. I woke up with the worst heartburn (thanks, balsamic!) so I called the front desk for some Tums. No problem, they arrived pronto. We packed up and called for a ride, and although they said they were busy, they arrived shortly after. 

I would love to come back here and stay a little longer. The service was great, the place was beautiful, and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect.",1

"Sidebar is a trendy, hip down town bar located above Pei Wei and Starbucks.
The bar is small, the decor is modern with a retro feel (Urban Outfitters, maybe?), dark wood, curvy white bar stools, ambient music and muted lighting.
The beer and wine selection is good. A little pricey ($3 PBR, but at least they have it, and $5 Blue Moon), but not too bad. They have a good selection of spirits, too, Patron, Chopin Vodka, Booker's Bourbon, as well as the standard stuff, so there is definitely something for everyone.
The ""smoking patio"" is a stairwell that leads outside the building. So, needless to say, it can get a little ridiculous with people crammed on the stairs puffing away.
The place was cool. The crowd was definitely the hip and trendy crowd, but not too pretentious. 
After a second trip here on New Year's Eve, I am sold. The cover was only $5, the staff is/was friendly, warm and welcoming. They have great drink specials, not just the price but great creations.",1
"Eh... the food was good but not something I'd crave?  I had a chicken/swiss panini that evidently came with corn on it?

EDIT: (actually it was the Adobe Panini: ""Mesquite turkey, fresh mozzarella, green peppers, corn relish and chipotle mayo"".  I got called out that there wasn't anything on the menu I said I ate, got it a little wrong but the review remains the same regardless. Here you go Bob M.)

Slightly surprised on it but, can't complain... it was good but nothing great.

They have subs and soups too - I'd go there again if friends were already going but def not somewhere I'd really mention when trying to think of somewhere to eat.",0
"I'm  going to stop being such a taker, and give for once! I use Yelp along with other reputable websites to help make my dining, travel and shopping decisions and I never take the time to give back!! I know, I know....awful. I'm turning over a new leaf! Here is my first Yelp. Please don't judge. It's my first time.... Okay, here goes. So, I went to Matt's for the first time a few days ago....

Food- Amazing.  Best pancakes ever! I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is but they are beyond good! Fluffy little cakes of love. I also tasted the butter burger. Very, very, yummy. If you decide to dine here make sure you try the bacon. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Sweet, savory and cooked just right.

The building is very small, the wait is extra long and make sure you don't overindulge on the free refills of ice tea because there is NO BATHROOM!! The seating is cramped and the service is rushed, but the food is worth dealing with Matt's shortcomings.",1
"if you want a really filling, delicious ""please-make-my-head-stop-feeling-like-it's-about-to-explode"" hangover cure, there guys have got the remedy!  the hangover helper is all of the above and get's even better when you add the hair of the dog bloody mary for an extra $3! (they also have live music on sundays during brunch!)

the architecture and windows are stunning in this place - if you've never been in here, it's worth checking it out!",0
"Have been here several times prior, food is ok and service is mediocre at best. Sitting at the bar to eat and drink does not = fast, quality service. It equates to unattentive bartenders watching sports rather than clearing plates or pouring drinks. An empty pint should have another offered in its place, and napkins on plates are clear indicators that one is done! Fifteen minutes passed before plates were cleared!!! Service MUST improve!!!",0
"went midweek and were seated right away

Table was clean, service was adequate but food, meh.
Hasbrowns barely cooked and no flavor and the famous biscuits were more like mini loaves of bread with no biscuit consistency and the gravy was honestly just blah.  After hearing such rave reviews I had to try it once but don't need to go back.  Kinda sad because I love breakfast.",0
"This location is quieter than the one at Arizona Mills Mall. No screaming kids in your way. The clothes are less disheveled, still attached to the hanger, but for the same low price. I get my husband's work shirts here for like $8. Ross understands that there are still skinny Americans out there and they carry size 4 pants. YESSSSS!

I -3 the unusual house goods you can find at Ross. I redid my whole bathroom and made it into a nice Victorian style in light pink and a wood brown. They had this soft-green painted shelf that looked like a twisted vine. Where else can you find something like that? I found these two toothbrush cups that were painted with butterflies. Worth the $5 each. My bathroom is gorgeous. You'll want to take a crap in there.",1
"Stadium was REALLY nice... the MORONS in control of the parking...not so much.  I understand that you're not going to get doctors/lawyers/rocket scientists to control parking and move traffic in and out of the game.  HOWEVER, it would be nice if Glendale would pull their heads out of their butts and build a new on/off ramp for the stadium.  It took over 30mins to get out of the parking lot!!  To make it worse..the Cards lost :(",0
"Hard to miss with a Centurion guarding the entrance.  

I wished it was nice patio weather.  The place was very cozy and a little uncomfortable padded banko seating.  If the tables were only several inches higher, it would have been better!  

First off, we ordered Baked Brie and Raspberry  wrapped in puff pastry hors d'oeuvres with a side of grapes.  A couple of glasses of light and fruity red Portugal wines paired well. 

""Can I have some lemonade?"", nope, no lemonade.  ""How about Sprite?"", sorry, no Sprite.  So sad to see the look on cutie pie's face.  Even wine bars would have had something for him to drink.  ""Okay, water is fine.""  He gloomly said.  We promised him an Italian soda next door at Lola's.  He cheered up.

Killer pizzas, so I've heard.  We decided to order the Mozarella, basil (pesto instead), white truffle oil pizza.  The crust is amazingly toasty outside and soft and flaky inside.  Good 14"" inches for $12 pie!   We added Risotto with manchego cheese/chorizo.  It was very, very, very rich!  It was so rich, I wanted to reach for some bread to sop it up!

We were so full and carbo-ed up!  We didn't balance out our meals very well.   Good thing we took the lightrail downtown.  We needed to do a lot of walking after all that eating!

Kudos to the chef and the hostess/server, they were absolutely wonderful.

"Wine tasting with light food, or just wine to go - both are good at this location, and they have numerous bottles that you don't see at the larger wine shops in the valley.  

Most employees know their fair share about wine unlike Total Wine & BevMo that only hires ignorant, inexpensive, unskilled labor.

Wines are served in proper glassware, by the individual glass, or in a ""flight"" if you wish to taste several.  Located near Borders in the shopping center on the north side of Mayo.",1
"LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.  Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!",1
"Rental car review.

118 degrees.  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.  Finally, a bus!  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.

PHX...pay attention.  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by.",0
Got a pretty decent HAND car wash for $15.00.  They asked about extras but weren't pushy about it.  After I paid I noticed their gas prices.  They were about $0.20 less than the going rate in the area.  The frosting on the cake was that I got a $2.00 senior discount.,1
"Eh.

I wouldn't spend my money to stay here ever again.  The hotel itself looks nice.  It's large, spacious and the bar by the lobby is impressive.

But the rooms...Well I feel as if they're nothing special and the heavenly beds were not as heavenly as I had imagined.

The pool service was awful as well.  The managers don't know what they're doing and the pool is always overstaffed with lazy high school kids or severely understaffed with one or two servers for the entire pool area.

For the price, I'd go stay at the Four Seasons, where they actually know what good customer service is.",0
"I like Buffalo. They always buy my stuff, and I like looking around at what they have. 
 
I think the reason a lot of people don't like this place is because they try to sell ugly nasty shit that no one wants to wear. It's a recession, so, you're not going to get top dollar for your J Crew tee shirts that you bought 4 years ago that have pit stains and are hideous. Duh.",1
"Headed back to Lobby's. How I missed this tasty burger. I wasn't disappointed with round 2. The burger was still fantastic! I'm also happy that the fries were a little bit less salty than my previous trip. 

With any burger purchase, getting the combo pack (fries/soda) is the smart choice.

I do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks.

Make sure to grab plenty of napkins before you sit down. The burger can make a mess with the homemade sauce dripping off the meat and bun. That's a good thing in my opinion!",1
"I've passed by prestige nails in walmart 100s of times but never really thought of having a pedicure there (even though they are always busy!) As I stared at my feet, long overdue for a pedicure, I thought it was about time to try them...since walmart rarely let's me down why should the nail salon inside?

To my surprise I got a wonderful pedicure or $23 not too bad this day in age...my to mention it was just as good as going to the more upscale salon just across the street! 

I'm glad to be the first to review them they deserve it! Now if only they did facials at walmart and hair I'd be set!",1
"Your Mexican grammaw won't necessarily jump up and
down screaming ""¡Muy Auténtico!"" but this place still
delivers. Standard Mexican fare with pretty decent
service. If you check-in on Yelp, you get a 5 dollar
off your meal coupon. I really like the hot sauce that
comes with the chips and salsa. Spicy and very flavorful.
And the Mango Margaritas - nice and stiff. Their entrees
are good especially the enchiladas. And I usually get
a side of the calabacitas. They're open till 11pm on
Fridays and Saturdays which is usually when I actually
make it over here. A late dinner after some event. 
Parking is always good since it's a mall.",1

"One word to describe Over Easy: disappointing. 

It would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype. I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.

The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.

Sorry Over Easy, you were quite disappointing.",0
"This place shares with a Circle K.
Hate to say it, but get your 44oz. drink in Circle K for 86 cents to go with your chicken.

But I'm here just to deliver my Inside Skinny:
Tuesday has a leg n thigh for 99 CENTS, mild or spicy!
If you've had issues with freshness, go on a Tuesday, everyone knows about this deal and they're making lots of chicken all the time. LOAD UP!!! I get 5 orders and make it last a few days.

MY PIG-OUT STUNT:
Take the layer of skin from the top of a thigh and place on a plate crunchy side down, then peel off a chunk of chicken from the piece and place it on top of the skin. Apply a really generous amount of Frank's Red Hot or Trappey's Red Devil cayenne sauce. Fold skin like a taco and shove the whole thing in your mouth!!!!

No one can top this deal.
Church's tried but they just couldn't hang.
Sometimes the Popeye's thighs are a little small, but hey for 99 cents, what a deal!

"SAKE    *Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice; usually served hot .

( Full disclosure : I don't like sake)

Parents in Scottsdale for a first look at the new house / neighborhood. We were on the horns of a dilemma : ? Would a mid week , early season dinner at the club be too quiet? Should we  descend south of  the Frank Loyd Wright  into south - north Scottsdale....??

We opted for the safe bet - booked a car and headed south to the Ocean Club.

** A) never drink and drive in Scottsdale ( or anywhere else for that matter)

**B) if you're a foreigner - never- ever drink and drive in Scottsdale

**C) A + B refer to you Nikolai Khabibulin 


(( A nod of support to the YELP community . After perusing the Ocean Club reviews retrospectively I believe the correlation existing between the posted notes and reality to be around 0.90 Well Done!!
( I would go as high as a correlation of 0.95 if high and low marks were thrown out ( similar to olympic skating or gymnastics)))


We arrived at the club---- a good bar crowd ( not quite as Mountain lioness(y) as i had expected (? hoped?) -- ? mid week perhaps...?,
a good blend of hipsters , hobos and Mrs Lovey Howell III's 

( score +1 for the Ocean Club)


We were promptly seated - at a good table - well positioned , near the back and partially curtained - nice.

The waiter then promptly arrived to take our drink orders:

Now - I don't like Sake ( see note above) - but on occasion - I like to fancy myself as the kind of guy who may indeed like Sake- hence , I order a Grey Goose Sake Martini -

"" I have no Sake"" the waiter announces sadly.
Now - this is tricky - can I in good conscience penalize the establishment for not having a beverage that I really don't like or want in the first place?

Too bad for you Ocean Club 'cause yes I can.

The drinks arrive - I have opted for Grey Goose sans Sake
and yes -sweet Jesus  they are huge ( see prior posts).

The waiter then arrives to review the menu and describe the specials-
This he does without note , blackboard , evening card or inked cheat note on his wrist-

He recites for what seems to be forever...
It is like a reading from the old testament - but instead of a mere chapter of the book of Leviticus - he recites the entire book....
I am captivated ....( or is it the Grey Goose)

?? does he really know the name of the Italian girl who dug this evenings truffles up in Piedmont...??

?? does he really know the glove size of the Japanese ranch worker who massaged the Wagyu beef and from which prefecture he hailed...??

at any rate - I am entertained

I normally don't hit the concession stand, but there is a wide variety of snacks that seem to be a bit cheaper than other movie places.

"I am not one to hang out in Downtown Phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly it's boring.  However, when I visited Copper Blues on 2/4/12 prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events.

Here's Why ... They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.  It's a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.  Budweiser drafts were only $5 and soda was only $3.  We didn't try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live.

Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days.

On this Satuday night people were having a good time.  The draft beer was perfect and fresh.  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully.

We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 2/23/12 to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door.

This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !",1

"01/04/2012

I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of ""Daddy Long Legs,"" ATC's first musical production, at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!  

I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend ""Daddy Long Legs"" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)",1
"Been to the Saigon Kitchen 3 times now.  Once with a friend, another with my teenage daughter and other on a lunch date with my husband.  Will have to say have been absolutely pleased each time.  I ordered the Shaken beef (diced Filet Mignon) each time.  Husband ordered the Chicken Curry (which he liked) and we enjoyed egg rolls.  

The food has been hot, tastes fresh, excellent presentation and absolutely delicious.  Portions, in my opinion, are definitely a good portion---just right.  Entree is served with white rice, soup/broth, and a tasty shredded side salad with a great Asian dressing.  

Staff was polite and attentive, food came out in a timely manner.  Have thoroughly enjoyed my experience each time.   They play nice ""Global Ambient"" music, the restaurant is somewhat small yet cozy.  It has a nice ""grown up"" simple Asian feel.  Definitely a great place to meet a significant other or good friend to lunch.  

NOT a place I would recommend for children; tables are somewhat close together and it has a relaxing feel.  Menu seemingly NOT designed with kids meals etc.  Also a bit expensive if considering price.  Hubby and I each had the Shaken Beef lunch with egg roll appetizer and drinks, it came out to $39.    Worth the money, but if you are watching budget on a lunch date, just something to consider.

We definitely have listed this as a favorite place for us to dine sans kids!",1
to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.  Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----,0

I ordered a Turkey Tom. This was basically a big white dried out sandwich roll with a couple of slices of turkey, a butt-load of shredded lettuce, a couple of sliced tomatoes and some mayo (I requested no sprouts which are normally also included).

Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. 

To the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively. 

And your salads are severely overpriced 

Won't go back unless I'm desperate.",0
"If I were to have written this review 2 years ago, it would have been 5 stars, but the portions keep on shrinking at an alarming rate. Today I had the meat plate and no more than 2 tablespoons of pulled pork, and brisket were on the plate. Also, what's with the staff? They are like robot drones! Absolutely no personality! The food's flavor, and quality, however, are very good, the place is always sqeaky clean.. and of course the decor is very amusing. Being a hungry hungry hippo, I would prefer a slight price increase, to maintain portion size.",0
"My husband and I frequent this restaurant quite a bit. We use to be huge fans of the Ahi Tuna burger with sweet potato fries (the fries rock). Unfortunately, they removed the Ahi Tuna burger from the menu which was very disappointing. I do like the Tiki fish sandwich though. I do which that they would included a fish sandwich on their lunch menu on the weekend. Although, when I have gone for lunch on the weekend and have asked if they can make a fish sandwich they have always accommodated me. 

I would give this place 5 star, but I think their one weakness is their brunch menu. I took a friend there for lunch because we loved their dinner and lunch menu so much, but it was very disappointing. We ordered Bloody Mary's and had to send them back because the horseradish was overwhelming. In fact, all you could taste was horseradish, no tomato juice or anything. All three of us sent them back and they could remake them because they were part of a batch that they pre-mixed - UGH! Plus, I was the only one that liked my breakfast. My husband and friend were not impressed. 

Also, I adore their Hawaiian fish ceviche - yum!!",1
"The boyfriend and I like to do little staycations every now and then so when we saw a deal advertised for the Camelback Inn we jumped on it. We stayed two nights in just a regular room, I guess. They had several different kinds of suites (even rooms with a private pool!) but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast.

Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected. Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property. It's not the easiest place to find your way around but at least it's pretty to look at while you get lost. At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up. It looks like they do corporate events - cowboy cookouts - but nothing was going on while we were there. But we had fun wandering around the ""town"" and taking goofy pictures of each other.

Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool. The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days. They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool. There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer.

We ate at two of the restaurants while we were there - BLT Steak and Rita's Kitchen and both were fantastic. 

We loved our Camelback Inn staycation and would not hesitate to go back - especially in the summer when the rates are low!",1
"I really enjoy this place. It's beautifully designed. It's hidden in a historic neighborhood, (zoning issues so no patio), and they make they own tonic! ---What else does one need? 

But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around. 

Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time. 

This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously.",1
Love this place. Quaint.  Nice owners.  The meatloaf is fantastic.  Reminds me a little of home in Mn.  .. . old house.,1
"Like the other reviewers have said the service is really not that great.  Luckily they're saved the  really good food that they have.  We ordered so much food that our little two top table  couldn't possibly handle it all.  The mussels  might have been the best I've ever had. We also shared a Frito misto, which is really good except they're pretty chintzy with the shrimp they only gave us too.  The pastas were clearly handmade which appreciate and they're quite good. The owner came over to check on us a couple times which I appreciated.  I'm definitely coming back soon.",1
"The new Kale salad is to die for! 
I love this place! Every time we have lunch here it is busy but somehow the staff always finds us a seat! The food is always really good and the speed in which you get it is amazing. This is the best lunch place in the valley!",1
"My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything.  The food, as expected, was superior along with the professionalism of the staff.  The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.  
We began the nigth with a bottle of wine, the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.  All were exceptional!  As out main courses, my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.  (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.  For dessert, we had coffee and the evening's special, the donut holes with three dipping sauces.  All were fantastic.  The wife and I don't usually rate places with five stars, but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one.  Can't wait until we head back.",1
"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. 

Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. 

Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...

The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.

The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]

The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.

Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness"", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. 

The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. 

Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger"", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.

In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.

Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.

At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.

We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.",1
I really love the chicken and how it already comes with pickles o. The sandwich ... Fave.. I also love the buffalo sauce very addicting,1
"I actually love this place and I always get great service when I'm there. The tootsie roll is by far my favorite. 

I must say, however, that I recommend the Sakana on Power over the one on Elliot... for some reason, I like the sushi over there better...?",1
"Tanzy, Yelp, and Lindsey deserve the biggest standing O for this event.  

I honestly think I am still full from the generous food options that kept flowing.  I kept thinking we were done, but OH NO here comes another course.  I felt like I was at a chef tasting menu dinner.  

Right when we got there we had a glass of Champagne and were seated with a olive and meat plate followed by some bruschetta and local made cheese.  After the event officially started we were hit with amazing course after amazing course.  With never empty glasses of wine  

My Favs:

Sweet Corn Risotto

Scallops (cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmm)

Alaskan King Salmon

Center Cut Filet Mignon

Brussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts (Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING)

4 hour braised beef short rib (Talk about melt in your mouth)  

Red Velvet Bread Pudding (I will go back just for this anytime I am near the Quarter)

I can't wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I don't know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food.  

I was very surprised to hear they have been open for 2 years as I was really blown away with their food and service.  

Thanks again to everyone who helped put together this amazing event what a great way to end 2012.",1
"If I won the lottery and just wanted to spend a few hours a week working, it would have to be in this store.  One, because I would want to be there just to see all the THINGS all the time, and two, because I would be able to spend all my money there.  This place rocks.

This place has three buildings- the west one has pricier items, but the stuff is GORGEOUS (see previous lotto winning comment).  The east one has very reasonably priced items, contains seasonal trinkets and specialty food items.  The south building has kids stuff, pet items and clothing/purses as well as some home items.  It is the BEST place to find a gift for someone, or spend your overtime check on something nice for yourself. 

Want nice stationary?  A cute soup tureen?  A garden item? New collar for your dog? Fake fruit for your centerpiece?  Gorgeous picture frames?  Cute gauzy dress?  Hip handbags? Pretty bangles?  Antique key holders?  Whimsical signage? Artful platters?  Decorative bird cages?  Catch my drift?  They have EVERYTHING! :)",1
"I've been going to Jess @ Chace Salon for almost 2 years now and she is nothing short of amazing!!  Cut, color, highlights....she is my super stylist. :) If you are looking for someone to give you a new look, or just revamp a style you're already in love with, ask for her.",1
"My experience here was awesome from start to finish.  I was greeted by an extremely friendly, smiling man (I believe to be the owner) who helped me with my order decision, took my order, then asked me to ""please, sit down, be at home"".  Awesome.

I inquired about the salad and asked if they put any feta on the salad (they don't), he followed up informing me the sauce they serve has dairy, but that he would substitute garlic sauce instead.... now this might not seem like much, but to someone who has food allergies like myself, having someone with intimate knowledge of the ingredients and the care to make sure they don't serve you anything that might not agree with you is really a blessing and gives you assurance when you eat there.  Huge bonus.

I had a half chicken shawarma and  half gyros plate which came with hummous, salad, rice, cucumber (substituted instead of pita since I don't eat wheat... nice touch) and a side of garlic sauce.  I do not normally enjoy chicken shawarma, but he insisted I try.  Well, he was right, I will say now I love chicken shawarma, Aladdin's chicken shawarma.  Their gyros was awesome too.. homemade, not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety.  

I paid after my meal and was welcomed back with a handshake.  Service was awesome, food was awesome, and they were able to easily cater to my picky food needs.  A+!",1
"Their pizza needs to be in your mouth. BUTTERY crust. Like, butter buttery. And it's superb reheated at home in the toaster oven.",1
"I was able to get an excellent rate through hotels.com. $58 a night. Yes the room is small. But there were no bed bugs! A woman that was going to the same convention stayed at an upscale hotel near by and had bite marks all over her arm. :P 

I didn't get a chance to swim in the pool, but I checked it out and it was nice up there. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful.

The bathrooms are small. For some reason I had to keep the hot water turned all the way off. Otherwise the water would be scorching HOT!

The cable needs to be upgraded to digital.

Didn't run into any ghosts. Thank goodness!",1

"Last nights To-Go order: 
Char Burger w/avocado. Burger was delicious ~ Yum! 
Extra crispy french fries were perfect!
Price was reasonable for a burger of this caliber. 
No drive-thru
No waiters

"Located in the W Hotel in Old Town Scottsdale, this hipster hangout is always busy.  I recommend a reservation if you're planning to dine here.  The Better Half and I drop in here from time to time.  Since I don't eat Sushi, I order:

Ji-Dori Chicken Skewers withTeriyaki Sauce - $10
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=x_60nAIMvJX9k_s9HAPiOA

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=iKBiwthdGtENIqWfGK1V1A

The Chicken Skewers are very tasty.  The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of ""sour"" kick to it to balance the flavor.  The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.

The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.  Generally speaking, it's pretty good considering how busy they are.

The people watching here is pretty good...watching all of the hipsters is hilarious.

Return Factor - 93%",1
"I'm really not the type to want to go out for breakfast, I'd rather save my dining money for lunch or dinner because I figure I can usually make just as good of a breakfast at home.  However, there is no way I could match their french toast, it is just outstanding.  We have been twice and I ordered that both times.  The first time, I told the waitress to put the berry sauce on the side because I usually don't like fruit toppings, they are too sweet and fake tasting.   But this sauce is delicious! It is homemade and very natural tasting, I ate every bit of it.  We also loved the jalepeno bacon.  My kids loved the pigs in a blanket.  We had very nice service both times, we will definitely be back!",1
"The Roosevelt seeps a cool vibe that can only be attained by converting a historic house into a den of drunkeness. Ah, a banker's dream.

This is where my coworker, Dani, and I went after eating at Sens. She was going to a blind date and didn't want to show up alone, for fear that this guy would be a total psycho who would cut her hair and eat it in front of her. But this time, I already had two incredibly strong and delicious martinis from Sens and was very glad to have taken the light rail. I ordered the oatmeat stout and was quite pleased with it.

Can I just say how much I loved the decor? I totally want to move in here...or use it as inspiration for our next home.

So, the blind date guy wasn't a total scode and I let after half an hour. Dani, who was apprehensive about meeting this guy--who's a doctor, and I told her if she wasn't interested toss him my way (sorry, honey)--ended up having a good time with a nice guy.

We both ended the night exactly the same: Passed out with a cocktail in our hands.",1
"I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.  Pablo was laid back, but with only 4 couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.",1
"Well, let me start off with a look of confusion at the exceedingly rave reviews of this dining establishment. (Raised left eyebrow, and a smirk, but you already knew that)

So, initial impressions: Seemed like a confused ambience. Kind of clubish, with a little hubristic haze. The music was the only positive part, reminding me of HGTV's 'Selling New York.'

The waitstaff seemed somewhat confused, as we had 2 waiters at one point, but the bussers were top notch!

We were also sad to hear that the ""Happy hour"" menu was only in the bar.

Now to the food: The menu and the prices associated gave me a bad feeling right quick. I am too used to excellent sushi, at fair prices, as well as happy hour menus with all the favorites. (Especially dragon rolls! YUMZOID!) 

We proceeded to order a couple appetizers, and a handful of rolls. None of which were memorable in any positive light:

 The avocado roll was insipid with a strange clash of textures and flavors. (Soft avocado, and carrot sticks likeyourmompackedinyourbrownbaglunch and a strange dusting of what tasted like bread crumbs...) The spicy tuna had to be the only one that was acceptable, and it was interesting to have chunked tuna vs. the usual frappe. The softshell crab was weak, and the spicy yellow-tail was spicy, but pretty one-note, and not satisfying. 

 ***Bottom line: We decided to pay our bill, and then go straight to one of our favorite sushi spots to satisfy the sushi craving that we definitely missed out on: HIRO sushi. Man, let me tell you, I threw down a D-backs roll and a Crazy roll, and Hiro sushi was indeed the sushi Hero of the day ;)",0
"I went to this place on a friend's recommendation, but have only eaten the custard. The lemon is quite refreshing and fluffy although I wish is was a little less sweet. This is a great place to visit after a light meal in downtown Mesa if you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, but not go overboard. The service is fantastic and the parking is ample as they have a private lot. The inside of the restaurant is quite charming and diner like. If you are really looking for the full experience of frozen custard, eat it outside in the never-ending, relentless Arizona sun...you will truly feel the refreshment!",0
We bought or second Jura Compressa coffee machine from Sur La Table.  It was an expensive model priced over $3K.  After 2.5 short months it stopped working.  The only  option they offered was to send it in for repair.  When I asked to have it replaced I was told the turn around was 48 hours.  Its actually 4 -5 weeks when all is said and done.  I high priced item and thats the kind of customer service. Not to mention an expensive product that cant make it 90 days.  Extremely bad customer service on this one.,0
Everything you need to feel like you opened a time capsule!  Place makes me want to have 5 houses to slather in vintage odds and ends.  The place is very well organized and themed which makes it easy to find items while you're on the hunt.,1
"I love Fez. I have been coming here for years. The food is always good and there is something for everyone on their menu. One negative: the service is mediocre. It can be quite hit or miss, and sometimes the servers are just plain slow. One suggestion: the menu could use an update. The dining options have been pretty much the same for years, and it would be fun to mix things up a little. One more thing, I have ordered take out for groups of about 20 before...the staff and chef were GREAT to work with and extremely accommodating. This is a nice asset on the Central corridor.",1
"We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not comp'd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the ""we can't provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record"" line.

Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner, and was told ""he's out of town."" The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized.",0
"Stopped in, had a couple of drinks, paid and left. Nothing to get excited over, but a decent stop if you like Irish whiskey and need a fix.",0
"While Scottsdale's Jackrabbit Supper Club is Britney Spears-approved -- the pop singer made the rounds last December when she reportedly made out with Arizona Cardinals hottie Matt Leinart -- it's a little too clubby for my taste. The music is usually loud, making it hard to carry on a conversation and nearly everyone looks like they stepped out of the pages of a fashion magazine. Oh, and be prepared to throw down more than the norm for drinks -- martinis are $13! If all of this isn't scaring you away, you'll probably have a good time. And the best part? The bar offers hourly burlesque-style performances from the club's saucy dancers.",0
"Thanks to Sara V. I learned about Total Wine & More through her and when i heard they were opening up locations in Phoenix, I was excited. Anywho, 6 visits later, I can honestly say I'm a fan of total wine and moreso than BevMo. I love that there's a wide selection of wines from all over. My favorites are Riesling, Moscato, Rose, Pinot Noirs and sparkling wines. Yes, I love the sweet kinds.

Anywho, my most recent visit, had me buying two kinds of Rieslings both recommended, a Bree and the other one a German Riesling. I recently had Moscato the night before and loved, it was sweet like apple cider and very flavor, with it's apple and peach undertones...simply delish! The Bug Juice Moscato was YUM and elegant. I totally enjoy the selection not just for wines but for beers as well. I like that I can by some hoegardaan for cheap and I like the wine tastings going on. The staff's helpful and overall I like the layout and the prices!",1

Good beer selection.

Tasty appetizers.

Wait staff is friendly.",1

I really like their pesto chicken grilled pizza, but I could go on forever with all my favorites. Check out there craft beers too.

Simply delicious.",1
"Having just moved to Scottsdale, I had seen Four Peaks brews at local restaurants and couldn't wait to try it. My bf and I visited the brewery after a long day at the Phoenix Zoo. The location was easy to find with plenty of street parking (although it could be difficult during peak hours). We found a nice table on the half-indoor seating area. The ambiance was very cool, with a converted loft warehouse sort of feel.

The bf had the beer sampler, which I helped myself to some sips of. I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter, which was a great deal during happy hour. Next, I tried the Pumpkin Porter (full price, even during happy hour). Foodwise, I had the pub fish and chips, which are battered in Kilt Lifter, and the bf had the french dip. Both items were on par with good quality pub fare.

Kilt Lifter: great medium brew, very smooth. The type of beer you could drink every day and never tire of. Pumpkin Porter: we loved it so much, we purchased a growler so we could take some home! Note: there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew. $4 for the growler itself, $10 for beer, and $5 seasonal charge. Normal refills of growlers are $10.

I am a beer lover. I have spent time living in Munich and drinking some of the best beers in the world. You can't go wrong with Four Peaks brews. Next stop, North Scottsdale location. Closer to home and hopefully just as great!",1
"One of my fave spots when I'm hitting up the late night in Scottsdale. And yes, the Old Town location is SO much better than the one in North Scottsdale. 

Get there early for 2-for-1 martinis - they have a ton to choose from, if you're a frilly martini drinker - but also make a mean dirty martini with olives, which is my own personal indulgence. 

Multiple rooms for multiple scenes - a dance floor, a more chill bar room and an outdoor loungey space - so whatever you're looking for you can find it here. Just make sure you've got cab cash to get home - three of these martinis can definitely get the best of you!",1
probably my favorite restaurant :),1
"They try to be like In-N-Out, even down to the color scheme, but the burgers taste very different.  They offer cajun fries which have some extra seasoning, and if you ask for your fries ""well done"" they don't come out as soggy.  But if you're going with someone else, then one order of fries is all you'll need.  They give everyone huge helpings of fries and I'm never able to finish a single order so I just share it.  The burgers are excellent and the one thing that sets this place a part is the option to get fresh jalapenos on your burger.  Don't forget about breakfast!  This is where In-N-Out fails.  The breakfast burgers are great after a night of partying.",1
"Yes, it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place. Very tasty. All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches. I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good, but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad. Real good besides that.",1
"Yum yum yum! Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my list for Mexican restaurants! This is a New Mexican style restaurant with lots of hatch green chilies in their dishes. You can also buy them fresh from here by the pound during the month of August. 

I have eaten here probably 30+ times and they are always consistent. The chips are always fresh and warm  they serve two different salsas as well as bean dip. All three are the bomb! My favorite item on the menu is the whitesands chimichanga. Do not order this though if you can't handle spicy stuff. but if you are like me, the spicier the better, then go with this! 

Everyday they have good lunch specials. I like to go on Thurs because they have chimis for $1.99. For an extra dollar they will smother it with the white sands sauce. What a deal! And on Sunday they have kids day with a clown that makes animal balloons. And best of all, kids eat free! 

And if your a beer drinker they have a microbrewery too. I'm not a beer drinker though so I can't tell you how good it is. But the margaritas are on point!",1
"My experience at Old Town Tortilla Factory is probably very different than that of the average patron. I dined here with a semi-private party with 40 other guests and we were served buffet-style.

Our group was seated in their outdoor dining area, which I absolutely loved. I thought the atmosphere was great and brought an authentic Southwest feel and vibe to the restaurant. The food was as decent as you would expect sharing buffet-style with 40 other people lined up outdoors: nothing mind-blowingly memorable, but nothing too bad, either.

My one complaint would be the servers. Especially at our single table of 8, it did not seem the server we were assigned was equipped to take care of a large group. There was much unnecessary confusion at the end of the night when it came down to settling some bar tabs. Overall, it did not ruin our experience, but definitely took away from the overall positivity. 

Regardless, I would love to come back here with a smaller group and enjoy a fresh plate of food! The outdoor dining is definitely something you can't pass up...",0
"Friendly staff.
Fast check-out. 
Great selection.",1
"One of my favorite parks that I've been to! There are two areas, small and big. I have a small dog so I go into the little dog park. The running room in this area is much more limited than the big dog area, but that's ok - it seems to be enough room for the little ones. There is a water faucet to fill up water bowls and allow your dogs to cool off.

One of my favorite features are the trees! It's a mature park and the trees are gorgeous. They provide lots of shade and make for a relaxing soundtrack. 

This is one of the furthest parks from my house, but I always make the trek out there just to come here.",1
This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe. The food is great with many vegetarian options. The atmosphere is usually pretty quiet and the servers are all nice. Highly recommended,1
"They say its bar food done right - I'd have to say I agree.  Got the burger and wings - both very solid.  Love the beer choices.  The prices are very reasonable for specialty beer and good bar food.  All in all, I am definitely going back regularly!",1
"Let me qualify my review by stating that I have not been to Butter & Me.  I have had their yummy mini cupcakes at a Yelp event.

I tried the red velvet mini cupcake.  It was really good.  Moist and flavorful with a rich creamy frosting.  Yum.  I chased it with few sips of Cruz tequila.  Hey, it was in my other hand.

I also tried a chocolate mini cupcake.  Yummy.  Again, moist and delicious.  I don't know how they keep the mini ones from drying out.  When I make mini muffins at home they dry out easily (that is if any survive the first half hour...the survival rate for any kind of pastry in my vicinity is exceedingly low).

I also garnered a few extra cupcakes to take back to my wife and a friend and score points.  Mini cupcakes=brownie points.",1
"Had the Jalapeno burger.  Great stuff.

If you have not eaten here yet, I highly recommend it.

I've Had their Tri Tip, Beef & Pork Ribs, Pork, Brisket & Burgers along with most of their sides.  All were excellent.

Their Drink specials were great as well.",1
"One of my fave places in Phoenix.
Well stocked and friendly staff.
I don't normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be pricey,but one day I just decided to take a look.
That's when Border's became one of my fave places.
I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD.
I paid 40 bucks for it,but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before.
I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness.
For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for.
I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in.
Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet,the staffer called to have someone open the box,and bring a copy for me to look at.
I bought that too!
I will coninue to patronize Borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor!",1
"I cannot speak for the food, (though the menu looked unique and tantalizing), but the beer selection was great, as was service. We arrived on Saturday night, the first weekend Angels Trumpet was open, around 10 p.m. for drinks. There was a large group of us, 9 people... though there weren't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand/be seated comfortably around one of the high-tops.

This place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer. The selection cannot be beat in downtown Phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style... and they're always rotating. I had the Biere Blonde & White... 4.5% alcohol, light, sunny taste. Reminded me of Four Peak's SunBrew.

The selection ranges from hoppy IPAs at 10% alcohol/volume to the lighter, summer brews and everything in between. There is literally something for everyone, even a few wines on tap for the non-beer drinkers.

Our server was very nice and accommodating.. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly.

A couple reasons I didn't give Angels Trumpet the perfect '5' star rating:

Disorganization-- Seating was sort of a nightmare... and we kind of waited around for one of the high-tops to open up and just snagged it.
Ambience-- I enjoyed the nice, open floor plan but the restaurant-style and dozens of tables/chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I couldn't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge, 60"" TV screens weren't turned on. It'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special. If you're going to close the kitchen, allow people to walk around and mingle more.

Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome, unique beers on tap, Angels Trumpet is it. Their prices are reasonable for the quality offered. Haven't tried the food, but the menu is pretty diverse offering a spin on traditional bar food like flatbread pizzas and sandwiches.",1
"Angelina's Pho and grill was very good! excellent appetisers; which were very fresh and brought to us in a very timely manor. The service was very good! restaurant was very clean, as was bathroom!  the pho was good, not the best best in the valley but very good! the broth was a little bit too salty for me. we will defintely go to this pho restaurant again!",1
"3 months, 22 emails, 10 plus calls and (I think) we have the final refund from Budget! 
Stay clear of Budget Rental they DO NOT care about customers or resolving their monumental mistakes!",0
"Really great happy hour. The wines by the glass are $5 and are a much better value than the tapas they have on special (also for $5). The tapa plates are tiny, hence the 4 stars only. 

Must have: eggplant canelloni, manchego cheese, pancetta dates, Foie gras (just because I LOVE foie gras)
Skip: Lobster corn dogs -- while this was interesting, you couldn't taste the little crumb of lobster inside. 
So-so: yucca frites, French fromage

All in all, a lovely way to spend an early Sunday evening.",1
"I've only eaten the buffet here and it was good but nothing special.  To be fair, most Indian buffets are pretty similar, it's only when you order from the menu that you see if the restaurant is really a stand-out.  So, I will update this review when I've gone there for dinner",0
"Staying at the Royal Palms has been on my bucket list for a while now, because I've stayed at just about every other resort in town that I've really wanted to check out.  Oddly enough, this also happens to be the closest one to where I actually live, so it seems strange to drop a load of cash to stay in a hotel four miles away from home.  

No matter, last month was my golden birthday and this is where my lovely girlfriend decided we were going to stay.  Score.  We had my party (a surprise, nicely pulled off) and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities.  It was a pretty standard room, a bed, fireplace, a couple of chairs, big bathroom, a table and chairs on the patio (I believe they call it a valencia suite).  Life was grand.

Until the morning.  *bang bang*  WTF is that noise?  *bang bang*  There was pounding and various noises coming from the room next to us, and it wasn't happening on the bed.  Are they really doing construction at 8:15am?  It continued.  My girlfriend called down to the front desk.  The noise stopped.  Then it continued.  *bang bang*  We were about to lose it. They called our room, ""do you mind if they continue working?"".  Actually, we had just fallen back asleep...

So this is not how the Royal Palms treats their guests.  No, any resort with a Director of Romance is serious about making their guests stay enjoyable, so I knew this was not normal.  A conversation took place, and profanity and yelling wasn't even necessary.  Essentially, they were going to comp our room, but they offered that we stay another night in the presidential villa for the same price...how could we say no?

I hung out at the resort all day because I was feeling miserable.  They comped lunch, and about 4pm, they moved us to our new room.  Nice place, the presidential villa.  It's actually only one bedroom, but has a huge living room, dining room, kitchen, two fireplaces, three patios with fireplaces and water feature, old-school tub, double-shower with outdoor shower, a bidet,  you know...typical amenities.  I was still feeling terrible (yay, the flu!) , so we opted to order room service from T. Cooks.  Naturally, if they hadn't done enough, they comped dinner as well.

We had an extremely atypical experience at the Royal Palms our first night, I have no question about that.  But they more than made up for it.  They were gracious, they smiled, they apologized, and they made it right immediately.  I can't ask for anything more from that from a place that prides itself in its customer service.  

I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1
"This is a very pretty and very chic looking restaurant, and I hoped that the food was as good as the decor.  My friend and I had the sangria and the mojito, and then we shared a bruschetta and the garlic pizza.

I found the sangria a little on the acidic side, but drinkable, and it was fortified with something, because it was a lot stronger than it tasted.  My friend's mojito was good.

I LOVED the bruschetta. Not only were the toppings well-planned and delicious, but the bread had a nice crunch and a slightly smoky fire-baked taste to it. Ditto for the pizza, in which the crust shared the stage with the toppings.  Don't expect cheese-red sauce-and-pepperoni type pizzas, as you might expect from the look of the place, the pizza is artisianal.

Nearly half the seating is out on the patio, and one unusual feature is that the seats were low and the tables as well.  This makes it a good place to relax with your friends (as you feel like you're sitting on patio furniture) but harder to eat your food.

We had good service the night we went (a weeknight, around 8:30).  Zero wait for our table, and prompt, polite service.  I would definitely go here again.",1
"I've been twice now. When it first opened and then went a long time before going back.  I was impressed both times.
They're busy but not too busy that you can't get a table. 
This las time was for lunch. We sat outside by the fireplace. That made for nice ambiance cause it was a bit nippy outside. 
The server was pleasant and attentive. The food was so, so good. We had 2 cheeses for an appetizer and split a large salad. It was plenty of food for 2 and only spen $20.00.
The salad was not just ""a salad"". It was special :) Roasted sweetened pecans, chicken, PEARS!!! It was delish.",1
"I love this place! I love that it's to-go only (no 3 hour waits, like Pizzaria Bianco), and the mozzarella is mouth watering. 
Please try the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich. You won't regret it!",1
"This restaurant reminds more of Hong Kong (where I lived for a couple of years as a college exchange student many years ago) than any place in Arizona.  The atmosphere is definitely not upscale (more like some of the Long Wongs in PHX), and may be a bit of a culture shock to some, which is why I don't recommend it for everyone (4 instead of 5 stars).  The food, however, is very authentic, though they don't always have the exact ingredients that you would find in Hong Kong.  The dry flat rice noodles (ho fun) is among my all-time favorite Hong Kong dishes, and this place does it right. The clay pot dishes are also worth a try - really good. (Among the Chinese restaurants that I have tried in Phoenix, the Gourmet House of Hong Kong is #2.  Number 1 is the Great Wall, which I review elsewhere.)",1
"Healing hands!  A dedicated, professional  therapist/intricate bodyworker who listens to your needs to develope an individualized treatment.  Focused in addressing  my health concerns and goals.  A message like no other that left me  feeling restored with the added bonus of ""spot on"" nutritional advise ... an overall concern for your good health!   To feel renewed ... highly recommended!!!!!!!!",1
"Reviews of this place are all over the board, but I always eat there when I do my yearly Scottsdale gallery crawl. The food and ambience, a series of indoor and outdoor patio rooms, are quaint and very satisfying, with good size portions, and a very friendly staff. At least to me they are. I was last there in late November and had the days special, enchiladas in a poblano sauce which was quite good. The salsa is spiced just right.",1
"Stopped by for a beer and a snack.  Temp was around 70 so we sat outside.

My amber ale from Breckenridge was good, and my wife ordered the cheaper of their Pinot Noir's and it was also good.  Waiter was friendly and genuine.

I like their anti pasti menu.  You can pick and choose what you want.  We tried the 12-hour roasted tomatoes, olives, some almonds, manchego cheese, and sopresseta.  It was all good.

We are eager to go back and eat dinner - the menu looked appetizing.",1
"Yelper Jane B's review is remarkably similar to what I intended to include in my review.

We've stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead.

Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9' x 14'.

The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldn't swing all the way open.

Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space.

The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit.

I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasn't a DVD player we didn't have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didn't seem to mind.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy.

We got a great rate but hey, it's Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home.

We'll stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one.",0
The buns fall apart so you end up eating your burger with a soggy bun.  Staff does not seem to know what is going on and they are not well trained.  Can't think on their own.,0
"Had to go to Gila Bend for something and while we were there decided to stop and get something to eat.  Stopped at this restaurant and we're glad we did.  We ordered the large meat lovers calzone and wings to split.  The pizza dough they use for the crust is very good.  Nice flavor, slight crispness and not doughy.  I'm very particular about my wings and when I verified that they fried their wings we ordered some and we were pleased with them as well.  They made them as we requested, slightly crispy, because there's nothing worse than a soggy skinned wing that's like chewing on a piece of rubber.  Our server, can't recall her name, was very friendly and always checking back with us to see if we needed anything.  

There was a group of men a couple of tables away that ordered pizza that looked awesome.  Another table ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and what I think was a very large looking burger with fries, which they had the same idea as us, split to share.  The serving of spaghetti with meat sauce was a nice size serving as well.  Another patron ordered dessert which, according to the server, was a spimoni cake.  It looked really good too.  

If you are ever going thru or visiting Gila Bend for any reason, I would suggest that you stop here.",1
"It really was the perfect place to start our night. I was with a group of girls out for a bachelorette party and someone in our group suggested Drift. Loved it! It's totally cute, and I love the touristy Hawaiian vibe it's got going on. We had a few appetizers, a round of drinks, and a round of shots. The appetizers were simple and nothing spectacular. The drinks and shots were pretty good. Service was hit or miss. Our server was pretty attentive at the start but we had to hunt her down when we were done and ready to move on. I'd love to come back to Drift for dinner, the menu looked pretty good and I'd love to try another drink. If anything, I'd like to return to stare at the woman's bathroom again. Totally cool!",1
"The food was absolutely delicious.  Was very surprised in finding a good Asian restaurant here in Phoenix.  We had the papaya salad with soft shell crab, Phnom Penh noodle soup, and the lehong noodles.  All were delicious and very SE Asian.  I could not believe how great the food was.  But the best part was the grass jelly drink - it brought me back to my childhood.  Can't wait to try the other dishes here.  A definite must try here in Phoenix.",1
Great food! Good prices.,1
"I didn't eat here, so I guess I can't give a full review. But I did have a beer, and I did take the Orbit to downtown Tempe, and I walked over here and had a yummy pint for 2 bucks on Sunday evening. 
The more places that I can drink then take a bus home, the better.",1
Great hh prices. Like to go and unwind. Definetly give it a try,1
"Neiman Marcus is a great addition to my shopping go-to locations like Nordstrom, and well, Nordstrom. I usually only shop at Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, sometimes Saks.

Anyway. Neiman Marcus has impecable customer service but know that you kind of need to ""dress up"" to shop here. At least I feel uncomfortable if I come in in yoga gear. The selection is a nice compliment to Nordstrom -- much more tailored and designer specific. My boyfriend loves their men's section. 

I love their selection of Chanel handbags and other great purses. Plus, the layout of the store is just luxurious and calming. They don't carry MAC here but I love the Chanel, Christian Dior, and Laura Mercier counters. 

My ONLY complaint is their hours. Ugh. They close at 7 Monday through Saturday and 5 on Sunday. It's an hour earlier than the rest Scottsdale Fashion Square so there have been many times where I've trekked from Nordstrom to Neimans only to find they are closed. 

If you don't want to go through the mall there is complimentary valet at Neimans. You can park in their private lot but it's on a hill and narrow so if I'm feeling rushed I just valet....but I'm also not the best at parking.

NOTE: the only credit card they accept is AMEX. Otherwise it's cash or check. That's right, no Visa, no Mastercard",1
"Dr. Dairiki is terrific. She is professional, listens to you and explains things so that you know exactly what she is talking about. I have never had to wait and the other thing I like is that she calls you back personally to let you know test results or if you have questions (plus it is done in a timely fashion.)",1
Definitely the best choice of eating chinese food in the city where you have limited good Asian food around. The Singapore street noodle (curry noodle) is always been my favorite and the crab wonton is just a great appetizer to start! I also like their orange beef! Definitely worth to eat for!,1
Papago has a great beer selection & awesome food. Try the Orange Blossom!!,1
"Sacks is a different kind of sandwich shop. They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli. Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)

If you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. 

From their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed. 

Oh, and every sandwich comes with a lovely cookie. Brilliant.",1
"Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. 

I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  

My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  

Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.  

Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.  

Two thumbs way down.",0
"This place was unique for me because everyone seemed like they were inside smoking but it was an indoor outdoorish place.  There were heated lights and it was the only place that I found pretty crowded where if you walked the streets there weren't a lot of people.  

The food was good, I had the steak fajita, which you can't go wrong because its just steak.  But I also had a fish taco which was pretty good.  My boyfriend had the pick three meal, so he picked tacos, chimichanga, and enchilada.  His choice was good and the chimichanga was delish.  

The bathrooms were very rustic looking but it seemed to look that way, decent for a funky place like that.

They had live music Friday night, where a guy was doing bad covers on a few good songs.

The waitstaff was overall nice and they checked back at us here and there.

Overall I'd go back if I was in around Scottsdale again!",1
"The only thing you can say critically about the Thai House is the location isn't a home run.  But get past that, and get inside because the food is top shelf and the recepies are authentic making this a fave five spot for my family.  Start with a Thai Iced Tea, try a spicy soup, and don't miss the curry - but beware of the heat index and order according to your ability to enjoy flame in your flavor!  My personal favorite is tradtional Pad Thai - the perfect balance of peanut and chili spice with sticky noodles & chicken...",1
"Let me preface this review by saying that for the past 2 years I have lived in Boston, which has some decent Chinese restaurants, great food, but rude/curt/abrupt service. I had learned to keep my head down, not make eye contact and not ask any questions. Eat as fast as possible and get the hell out before someone starts yelling at you!

So understandably my guard was up when I entered Mu Shu Asian Grill. However, complete opposite here. Mr Mu Shu welcomed me to his establishment, asked me if I had ever been here before and took the time to explain the stir fry/salad bar station.

I was in the mood for Mu Shu, and a place named Mu Shu must have great Mu Shu, right? Mr MS described to me his version of MS, I heard him say something about a burrito, but I really wasn't paying too much attention as I smugly thought I knew everything there was to know about Mu Shu! Boy was I wrong! When I get it, it's bigger than my forearm. It's packed full of shrimp, veggies and fried rice. Wow, what a great flavour!

You've heard of Asian fusion? This is Mexasian!",1
"DO NOT GO HERE.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The setup is a little like ""Pei Wei"" where they take your order, give you a number, and bring the food to your table.  Placed our order, and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.  Waited a long time, all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us. Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready, but I still didn't have a table, so they kept saying they would ""put it under the heat lamp"" for me.  Finally eventually found a table, and then kept waiting and waiting for our food, which the manager claimed ""he had them remake"" since it was getting cold.  My food came, and it was cold and disgusting.  We had to get going since we were going to a show, and my mom's food still wasn't there.  The staff asked to see her receipt, since they couldn't find her order.  She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go (it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order).  He said her food would not be ready for a while, and gave her some cash, and we left.  My mom never even ate, and my food was horrible.  I would NOT recommend this place, it's awful.",0
"I feel bad giving this 2 stars but I'm basing it on other burger joints in the area. I recently Had a fab experience at Zinburger so this is why they are only getting 2 stars. Sat at the bar and ordered the cowboy Burger and adult choc milkshake ($14) pretty pricey and tasted just like a reg choc shake?? The burger bun on the bottom was extremely mushy and was not eaten. Overall I just have had better. All the burgers are $16, luckily we said ""happy birthday"" which is a deal thru today May 4th 3-6 PM that makes one burger free. Prob wont go back.",0
"I've got to hand it to Smart & Final for providing some incredibly economic pricing options for both name brand products and supplies. It's worth a visit to save some big bucks by shopping here. This is one of my go-to stops for party supplies like plates, cups, napkins, water, etc. Think of Smart & Final like the Dollar Store meets Costco.",0
Very friendly and knowledgeable guys.,1
"I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughter's 5th birthday! It is a great place for kids to have fun. Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything. Unfortunately, this was just a small family celebration. So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings. The pizza is always delicious to me, it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there. We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow. Needless to say this is a place that the kids love. They can eat great pizza & play which is all kids worry about.",1
"Very good noodle shop.  I got referred here on my second day in town by the folks at Fujiya.  They were right.  I went for lunch and I almost could have missed it, tucked away in a little corner in a shopping plaza.  But the outside appearance belied the cute interior. 

I am waiting for it to get cold out (or even mildly less than scorching) so I can go in for some Ramen!!  Real Ramen - nothing like it.  This trip I had Tempura and some cold noodles. - Good stuff.",1
"Okay, judging a Vietnamese restaurant on the decor is a little jaded IMHO.  Ambience is certainly a factor when dining, and if that's your most pressing criteria you're probably not fit to go into most Vietnamese places.
Pholicious does a great job with their food-went their for lunch over the weekend and tried their oxtail pho which was very good.  My buddy had chicken & vegetable chow fun which was also delicious.  Sizable portions and the most unique serving of Thai iced coffee I think I've ever had.  Almost like a half old time Italian espresso pot on top of a coffee cup that holds the coffee and condensed milk.  You're supposed to stir this then add the contents to the accompanying glass of ice.  Unlike dummy me who just dumped it in the ice :)",1
"its HOTin the valley in the summer time and QT lives up to its name-

HEAVEN in the summer time and the price is unbeatable!",1
"So last Monday the hubs and I got invited out to join some friends for $3 burgers at Maizies ($4 if you add cheese)

For 4 burgers (All with cheese on them) and 4 beers our total bill was only $30!!!!!!!! That is a smoking deal if I ever did see one! 

Our burgers came out fast and hot. They serve them on chibata bread! They give you a little side of chipotle mayo that is delicious, but not enough to cover a burger.


Our waiter was super fast and friendly! We will for sure be going back",1
"I live in downtown Phoenix; Boyfriend lives in Tempe. After two years of getting our date on at places like Postino's, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dick's Hideaway, and Padre's, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca.

In short. it's okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert. But this is tempered with over priced wine (almost $20 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?), small pieces of bruschetta (tasty - scratch that - REALLY tasty, but the slices are teeny tiny), and it's on Mill, so most of the other patrons are frat guys trying to impress sorority sisters, and if you're lucky, you'll get to see a couple of Greeks making out. Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didn't seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused.

The good service, cool atmosphere, tasty bruschetta choices, and creative, thin crust pizza get this place three stars. The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postino's for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that it's on Mill keeps it from 5 stars. We both really wanted to like this place, but I think next time we want to get dressed up and go out on the East side, we'll try somewhere else. In the meantime, we'll stick to downtown.",0
"Try the Chicken Parmesan!  It's the best I've ever had? Quite possibly. When I worked in that area we would hit it for lunch once a week. Donna is awesome in a take-no-shit-but-still-take-care-of-you kind of way. She calls it as she sees it and I think that's great. By your third visit she will most likely know what you are gunna order.
I can't comment on the rest of the menu as I've only ordered the Chicken Parm. Yeah, it's that good.",1
this place is no where close to anything you can get in la or oc. It taste liked it came out of the bag. plain and simple,0
"I came in for a gift for my boyfriend's pleasure.  The lady working there answered my questions thoroughly and professionally.  Any shyness or awkwardness I might have felt disappeared.  I was prepared to spend more for a different product but was steered to a better choice by this lady.  Turns out, my boyfriend was very happy with his gift.  This was around Halloween so there were a lot more items than usual like costumes, pasties... fun things.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this Fascinations!",1
"The BF and I got coffee here last night as part of the coffee tour of Phoenix!!. The coffee was alright, not too acidic, but not the most flavorful coffee, but the main reason for the 4 star review is they are open late and they deliver! How awesome! The people who work there were all friendly. The ice cream looked good...will have to try in the future.",1
"Delicious salad, pizza, and wine. We got the Padre pizza which is not on the menu, but fig, prosciutto, arugula, and ricotta... so delicious!! The crust is perfect! 

The best part is they have several BOTTLES of wine under $12. Yes, you could usually barely get a glass for that amount. Sold... ! We had the Four Vines ZIn that was amazing for only $10.99.",1
"One of the things I love about my neighborhood is that Cornish Pasty is w/in walking distance.

Every pasty Ive had here is awesome. My personal faves include the shepherds pie, the chicken pot pie, and the thanksgiving pasty.

Yes its tiny and loud, but it adds to the charm. Also, the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door= heaven.

We eat in and get to go. Tip for to go: have a beer or a cider w/ your wait.",1
"Yoli's has recently been popping up on Yelp's 'Best Of' front page. Many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that I am, I needed to go out and try it for myself.

My previous research told me that there were many 5 stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food. It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town.

When it comes to brunch at Yoli's, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isn't grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yoli's, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this ain't no brunch at the Four Seasons.

Their menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.

The service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didn't stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while. Overall I wasn't blown away with Yoli's but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices. As of now, a 3.75 stars on my book.

I am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive. With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about. Yoli, if you are reading this- I hope you take this advice, we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us. Good Luck!!",1
"Ringo is a tri color beagle. Ringo loves the dog park. There are so many dogs at chaparral he can run around with. The park is really nice, a big wide open space and is kept pretty clean. They have an active dog area and a passive dog area. We start in the active dog area and Ringo can run and get all his goons out, then we opt for a nice cool down in the passive area. Ringo likes to sniff small dogs. During really busy times when there are a lot of dogs Ringo can get intimidated and has trouble finding a crew to fit in with.",1
"Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!

I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.

The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.

I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.

Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.

About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  

Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!

On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.

For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.",0
"Needs a new name - now.  

The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep ""Pischke's"" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it ""The Blue Ribbon Cafe"" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.  

The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that.",0
"Great hotel in Central Phoenix for a stay-cation, but not necessarily a place to stay out of town and without a car. Not much around the area, and unless you're familiar with downtown, I would rather have a guest stay in Old Town Scottsdale, etc. BUT if you do stay here, it's awesome. Great boutique rooms. Awesome pool that's happening in the summer. A GREAT rooftop patio bar, and a very very busy lobby with Gallo Blanco attached. A great place to stay, but have a car!",1
"Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats.
rest of the dishes wasn't that impressive .
Weekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food.
but weekdays pretty slow.
If you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area.",1
"Why do people love this place?  MommaKat insisted on snacking here after a hard day of shopping, and I am not impressed.  AT ALL.

I had to coerce the boy behind the counter to make a salad my way, not the normal recipe.  It was like pulling teeth.. no seriously, no cheese.  and I want this dressing not that dressing.  

We stood in line for over 20 minutes at 4pm on a Saturday.  There were 2 couples in front of us.  LAME.

There were no forks, and the cashier forgot to give me my brownie, and i thought he was going to have a conniption when I asked twice.

Bathrooms were very nice and clean though.  Outdoor seating is very limited. 

Lame excuse for a panera-",0
"My co-workers and I refer to this place as ""Pizza n' Ants"".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem. 



As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!",0
"I'm in love. Bacon you have my heart and my stomach. After all- where else does everything come with one of my favorite foods attached to it? Even my Bloody Mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear, olives and onions. Probably one of the best Bloody Mary's I have had in awhile. 

The location is a little off the beaten path which is why, I think, people are lined up to get in the Breakfast Club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food, and here at Bacon- the food and service is better and there was no line on the Sunday I was there. 

I was seated in what they call ""the nook"" located on the side where I had full view of the restaurant. The menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham. You can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish. 

The food came up quickly and was delicious! My ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done (all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside) and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty. Given the size, this easily was a 4 egg omelet. Breakfast with drinks ran about $20 which was cheap for all the food I got. 

But I would be remiss if I didn't talk about what really blew me away about this place. It's the fantastic service! Everyone seems to be part of a larger team. I was greeted by one person, seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me. And countless people stopped by to ask how things were, if I needed more water for my tea, or if I wanted more preserves for my toast. It was unbelievable! While they have been open for 9 months- they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer. 

The ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths, checkered table cloths, and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups. There are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate, and other food ""cues"". I also liked that they have those ""roll up"" doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days. 

If I lived in Scottsdale- this would be my ""go to"" brunch place. What I don't get is why people are waiting in line at a place around the corner that left me a little cold. C'mon people. If you haven't checked Bacon out- you should. After all- what's not to like about, Bacon?",1
"We came here Sunday morning for a wonderful breakfast. Our server was Colleen. She was very attentive and we had  a great meal. The menu is so extensive with many ,many options. I got Florentine Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had a fabulous omelet with potatoes and toast. They were both delish!     Their Potatoes are fab!!   The Decor was very nice, and even though they were so busy,we did not wait long at all for our table.  Big parking lot and a nice waiting area as well. We will defiantly come back here soon.",1
This place is great. It is very clean and the staff is very nice and accommodating. Every time I walk out I am completely satisfied with the work.,1
"Side Door, West on Hayde, a small location that does it right. 
 If you respect the Chicago area you will recognize Vienna beef right away.  

I really enjoy the italian beef at this location, its hard to find a place that serves Italian Beef (see Defalcos Scottsdale Rd).  Bianca was our server and was very helpful for my first time, at the restaurant. If you live in the area check this place out for a quick bite to eat.  

Where are all the other reviews?",0
"I like the way they treat my dogs, really friendly staff.  They are really good about getting your pet seen in an emergency.  The facility itself is nice.  However, it feels as if they are always trying to sell me something things I don't need. This place is so expensive, we can never get out of there for less than $100.",0
"Perfect greasy food for the night after a bender, or a family breakfast. I'm cool bringing my 10-month old here because it's noisy and with so many other kids around she pretty much goes unnoticed, except by the nice waitresses.",1
"I'm not feeling the love here. Went to Hillside on the recommendation of a friend that lives nearby and loves the place. I would love it more if it was my local caf. We went on a Sunday morning, knew there would be a crowd but the wait in line wasn't long and we had a table right off.  The entire line stopped while the order taker bagged up the to go portion of my order, my friends pie to go ordered at the same time took over an hour to get to the table. What was that? the food is good the portions large. They can't afford to get a number system for the tables? A wait person stood behind the drinks station/bar bellowing my name. not even stepping around. I had to stand up and holler  because I COULD NOT FIND THE PERSON WHO HAD MY FOOD. The food was nice but living in the east valley I wouldn't drive cross town to eat here again.",0
Fairly typical Walgreens. Sell beer and wine now. Photo and pharmacy. Redbox movies.,1
This place is great!,1
"So.... our teenage daughter ran out of toilet paper.
No problem, right?  I'll just use paper towels... for 2 days.

Yeah, it was a mess and Roto Rooter fixed it. 
For only $400.00.

so then... they come back the next day to snake a camera thru the pipes.

I think maybe they were looking for problems because well, they found them.

Price quote.... between five to eight thousand dollars to repair some pipes.

Errrrrrrrrrrr..... I don't think so.

Did they do a good job with the problem at hand?  Yep.

Were they expensive?  Yeah.... I guess

Do I think they're now looking for an extra paycheck?  

What do you think?",0
"What an incredible little hidden gem!  I have lived here for 10 years and been to Richardson's a number of times, but I never even knew that Dick's Hideaway was around the corner hidden away behind those beautiful bougainvillea's.  The dcor was warm and woody with a very nice rustic feel.   This little place has the all the charm of the guys working inside.  As cozy as it was, I immediately felt like I just walked into that place 'where everybody knows your name'.  My friend's and I met for breakfast.  High top wooden rustic table or belly up to the bar?  Very comfortable, either way.  I was expecting the typical two egg breakfast, but to my delightful surprise, they have their own spin on breakfast.  Not sure if any of you had been to Richardson's (same owner AND same owner as Rokerij), but I swear they have the best red sauce on the planet.  I had 2 eggs, over medium, next to some rancho beans topped with a little bit of cheese, and some breakfast potatoes, ALL on top of a fresh flour tortilla.  The best part?  My eggs and beans were topped with their famous red sauce.  OH YEAH.  We were in heaven.  I think we have been there once a week ever since.  Highly recommended!  A +++",1
"Cummings took over the company that we originally used, and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems.

I haven't seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings we've found a bug almost every single day and not just 'bugs' but cockroaches. I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didn't do anything wrong. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. 

Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today.",0
"I have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years. This is a favorite of my friend's whole family. 

This place is so very consistent. They always have the same good things. If you're looking for buffet variety this is not the place. 

Everyone is so very nice. This place has been open for 30 years for good reason. I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good. 

Go and try not to get hooked. 

Enjoy!",1
"I finally saved up the amount I am willing to spend to make my backyard not look like tent city. mind you, i have never been to tent city but i have a feeling they look similar. minus the pool. 

my backard is set up where the pool takes up the entire yard and then a maximum of 5 feet surrounding rock space around the entire pool. welcome to my backyard.

this makes planting difficult. my original dream was to plant oleanders along every wall, let them grow super tall to block all of my neighbors and give me the privacy i've always wanted to skinny dip all summer long. don't judge.

I wanted oleanders because they sounded like a match made in heaven for my lack of green thumb. they're cheap, they flower, they grow fast and they're impossible to kill. well, i found out oleanders roots are too aggressive to be that close to my pool so sadly, no go. (i only have 5 ft, they need 10-15ft) 

I called moon valley to get some ideas so I could do research root systems. the guy on the phone just wanted to get me there. i told him i was looking for suggestions before heading there on this rainy day and he just kept saying in the cheesiest voice known to man 'oh ya, come on down, we have hundreds'.

you have hundreds of plants that are identical to oleanders minus the roots and resemble in price? really??? please list them so i can find out if you're a big fat liar. nope, not listing them. only wanted to get me there. i decided not to go because 1. it's raining, 2. he lied and said oleanders are ok. i just have to have the drip system on 24/7. thanks for your freakin help.  3. he's a liar so even if i went they would lie to me. 4. i hate liars 5. i went in before in the past and told them what i wanted, they gave me a free backyard design and they completely didn't listen to me and created a backyard that cost 2k. who do they think i am? i live in mesa for crying out loud. not paradise valley. i wasn't going to let them waste my time like that again. 

if you're wondering why i could give them a 2nd chance after that- it's bc this time *I* was going to wear the pants in the relationship.

you could have had my entire (low) budget moon valley, but the unwillingness to help or be honest means i will be going elsewhere. someplace that will straight up say 'i can fulfill your skinny dipping in privacy dreams, while making your backyard look pretty as cheaply as possible and i won't destroy your pool while i'm at it'",0
Mastro's serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddy's.,1
"The place isn't have bad.  I got a sweet and sour lunch combo, and it came out fine.  Their menus pretty thurough, and prices are really fair.  Its chinese food, and if your in the area, it should get you where you need to go.

Place is clean, staff is friendly.  Would return for lunch here again soon.",0
"Arizona definitely lack cool spots, but luckily they have The Vig. The venue has a nice patio area--perfect for warmer nights, but the inside tables are fine too.  


My friends brought me on a Sunday night where all their bottle wines are 50%off... which is pretty awesome. The service was friendly and the food was legit. Try the ""Good ol' Steak Salad"" and Crabmeat Artichoke dip! 

btw the valet is $3.",1
"Made an appointment on the day I went. I only had my lunch break, but they made it a worthwhile and affordable experience! No hidden charges for the exfoliating salt scrub. I received a beautiful pedicure in a clean atmosphere in under an hour. Success!",1
The food was good and all prepared as I waited.  Looks like a long list of wide ranging bad foods that make you feel so good!,1
"Came here the other night in a party of 17.  Overall the experience was satisfying.  The waitresses were nice (yes, some had serious cleavage) and they were mostly on top of things - ordering the kids plates first, getting drinks/orders put in.

The drinks were huge - I had a margarita which was served in a wine carafe.  Unfortunately there was hardly any alcohol in it so I supplemented with a shot of silver tequila.  Probably could have used a couple more shots!

I had the baby back ribs.  The order was huge and I did my best.  The meat was tender and the sauce spicy.  Overall it exceeded my expectations (which weren't too high given what I've read here).  The plus was the entertainment value with people trying to ride the mechanical bull.  Only one person from our group did it - after 4 shots of Jack Daniels!

Overall a great place to go to if you're looking for a casual place with some eye candy, decent food, and side entertainment.",0
"As far as teppanyaki restaurants go this one isn't top of my favorites. 2 stars for good service and a nice setting... I'm docking 3 stars for my food being over cooked and not being offered anything to replace it, and our chef not doing any sort of classic teppanyaki cooking tricks (making oil light on fire, flipping shrip at people, bouncing his utensils around.. ect). Decent place to eat, but not a value for what you pay for.",0
"I had to do some painting and needed help locating items and suggestions from the staff and boy were they ever helpful.  Nothing like Home Depot, where you have to go and hunt down an employee and when you do they can't wait to get back to their break or whatever was more important than their customer.  I was just overwhelmed by the courteous and quick service I received at this location.  Even their quality of garden plants surpassed several other super stores.",1
"Great place for all your favorite kinds of Asian food.  Wonderful service...it's a big place and they were busy, but since someone in our group was in a hurry to get to a flight they still managed to hurry things along.  Overall good food and huge portions.  The Happy Hour specials are great, too, so be sure to come during that time.",1
One of the best restaurant in town. I have been there few times and they really manage to wow me every time ! The owner if nice and friendly and is really on top of things. The service is great and the food is amazing ! We are going again this Saturday and I can't wait to taste their New Years eve menu. Happy New year :),1
"This place is the classic bait and switch joint.  I ordered through the drive-thru and told the person I was ordering that I had a coupon for a ""buy one-get one free"" Chicken Tender Sandwich,  The bun was hard and not at all like the picture on the coupon. The two small tenders were extremely rubbery and looked like they had been retrieved from the trash can after they had been tossed for being under a heat lamp too long. The lettuce was the part that most people toss when cleaning and the tomatoes were thin and pale and looked like they had been genetically mutated . . .uhh, I mean grown.  This wasn't the first time the server manager did this to me. I should have known better. I used a coupon a while back there for a buy one, get one free breakfast burrito and asked that they prepare it to look like the picture that appeared on the coupon. My bad!  When I got down the road and reached into the bag to take a bite, the cook had apparently taken an onion and diced it up super fine and threw that in with it.  If you want a decent hamburger or chicken sandwich without attitude and that looks as advertised or better, go to smash burger. As for this place, never, never  again.  The only good Carl's Jr. I have found in the valley so far is off the Superstition (Hwy 60) and Tomahawk.  From the Manager down, they strive to live up to their advertising.",0
"We get a date night rarely throughout the year, so I try and find something new when ever we get that chance. Once we made it into the restaurant we were both quite pleased with the decor and the atmosphere, little did we realize that this was just the beginning! The wait staff here is beyond friendly and knowledgeable, our server Sam was what you would consider first class in every aspect. His attention and knowledge started our evening off in such a way that I feel indebted to him!! Then comes the food....! We had a four course meal that not only included a wine pairing for two of the courses, but also a pre-dinner cocktail. The food was exquisite, the pork chop with the kale and pickled onion main course was grand, and the paired wine could not have been better.",1
"The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!  The service was not up to par either.  I really can't believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides, etc.  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.  That's right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.  What is that 100% profit/mark up?  I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.  I would definitely not recommended this place.  If you want a fancy, awesome meal go to Houston's!  The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!  Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!  You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper!",0
"Awesome, Big Ben sandwich is delish and chocolate/strawberry scones is one of the best I have ever had, and can't forget to mention the coffee and tea, great place",1
Pretty decent food. Friendliness of staff is hit or miss.,0
"Nice bowling alley.  I liked it alot and the staff was very helpful when we could not figure stuff out!  The flatscreens with the score were nice and the animation of Pros were a nice upgrade. We came when their was a deal which was nice.  Thursday- 5 buck cover and free shoes,dollar games, popcorn, beer, and hot dogs all night.... all I gotta say it\s that I did my damage!  The set up for finding a v\ball was far nicer than any other alley I have been to!  Very out of thew way and easy to find what you need!
Very well lit alley with a fun atmosphere!",1
"Came to Blanco Tacos during Restaurant Week 2009. The guacamole they served with the chips was so yummy! The flan was also delicious. I will come back just to eat the flan! 

The scene was pretty cool. Fun people watching environment.",0
"Oh god. It's like GOD'S VERY OWN HOT POCKET. Fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly, though I have trouble bringing myself to get anything but The Pilgrim (served with turkey, cubed sweet potatoes, onions, and deliciousness). Cornish Pasty is great, though you'll likely want to consider takeout: it's TINY and finding a table can be a real pain.

The staff is fun and helpful, even though they're quite harried, and the oven-roasted potatoes are fantastic, as are nearly all of the pasty options, all priced damn well, to boot. If you've never been, they'll almost certainly have something you like. My only problem is that nothing is customizable: they're all served as is, which I understand from a production standpoint, but which frustrates for the number of menu items with just one dealbreaking ingredient for me.

Overall, it's exceedingly easy to be a regular, and to feel VERY full, careful not to eat the crimped part of the pasty, just like the tin miners of yore so as to avoid the traces of arsenic from their dirty hands.",1
"If you're in the neighborhood, it's not full of skivers having a session. Service was friendly and ample. Food was good. Exactly the pub we needed to find. A chat with a local Barney, the jig my daughter ripped into was heart felt, live music, and a boxty that tastes like my dad made it.",1
"Truly a great owner who cares about his customers!   I highly recommend a visit if you like one of a kind, quality pieces....young, yet classic, tasteful, yet funky.

"Went here this morning around 10 am. There was like a 20 minute wait, but no biggie. Service was fast, orders were fresh and correct, and place was clean. It is the Waffle House, not a fancy joint. So for what it is, it was good. Plus the staff are all very easy going and create a fun lively atmosphere. Good for a casual breakfast.",1
"This was the first real ballet I have ever been to, and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker! I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years. 

Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating. 

I can't say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season....",1
I went here for a birthday party it was a group of 9 and everyone got good service. It was good in taste but more expensive than some of the ones that were closer to me in Mesa. I would go back but only as a group. If you are closer to this place than say Sushi Ave go here you wont be dissappointed.,1
"I've eaten a huge percentage of the food on Green's menu and I love it all. If nothing else, come here to try the Soynami's (vegan Blizzards). I'm not a fan of rice or soy ice cream but this stuff is amazingly good.

The bowl meals are packed with great fresh vegetables. I mostly eat whole foods and don't consider the fake meats to be especially healthful, but I love to eat the fake meat here once in a while for the texture. It's so good. It's not exactly like the real thing, but it doesn't need to be. It's delicious as it is. 

There is always a huge variety of people eating here all the time. It's always packed, always hard to get a table. Good for Green Restaurant!

Atmosphere: The restaurant is made with green materials. Every time we go they are showing the work of a different artist. It's college-indie and casual.

The employees don't act super enthusiastic, but they're decent and polite and do a good job. I love the humor of whoever it is that writes up the food specials on the chalkboard. 

BTW, you can get vegan whipped cream here and it's SO GOOD!   :)",1
"My husband and I tried this place out since it is fairly close to our house and gets decent reviews.  I drank, my husband ate.  The wine selection is ok and the staff seemed friendly.  My husband's dinner was okay.  I'd probably give this place better reviews had they not attempted to give themselves a $15 bump on their tip.  I'd also probably give them better reviews if the manager would have called me back after leaving a message with a staff member about the charge especially when I left all the details necessary to fix the issue and was promised a call back that afternoon when the manager arrived.  Now, I can only assume it was not an inadvertent mistake since they give me no reason to believe otherwise.  I really would rather not have to keep calling back and chase my $$ down.

Edited review - took them from 1 star to 3 stars since I received a phone call today from a manager and was advised it was a mistake and they credited me back the funds.  Also will be sending me a gift card for the trouble.  Overall, I appreciate the follow up and their efforts to fix the issue and bring me back in.  I was routing for them since the patio seems like a pretty chill place to have some drinks and unwind.",0
"My favorite trail in South Mountain starts at the trail head just south of 24th st and Baseline.  It's the start of the Mormon Loop and when you connect up to the Mormon Trail/National Trail it extends the hike to about 4 or so miles.  Or at least that's what I have been telling myself.  First part is stair master-esque, then descends very gradually (perfect place to add a run into your hike), then ascends again (catch your breathe) and then gets a bit boulder-y and you can either straight up hike this or run.  If you want, you can take the offshoot to Hidden Valley and Fat Man's Pass.  I wasn't too impressed with either, but it is definitely worth a view and will spit you back out onto the National Trail.",1
"Love this place! Nestled in the side of the mountain, The Four Seasons is what you would expect from their properties. Smiling and friendly faces, exceptional service, a beautiful pool area and an atmosphere to help you relax. 
While both the restaurant and banquet food was good, it was not 5 Star. For these prices, it should be. Don't get me wrong, it was very good. Just not great. The lobby bar, Onyx, is small but get's hopping and is a welcome retreat from relaxation when you need some fun strangers to talk with. 
Having stayed here twice and visiting friends for cocktails on their patios, I can tell you the rooms varied greatly from huge to average in size. Some with lap pools and patios while others had private decks up against the hills. 
The wonderful smell of chiminea burning along the paths add to a delightful get-a-way. I highly suggest this resort if you are in the mood to relax. It's not near much so you won't be tempted to do anything. And that's my idea of a vacation.",1
"This place was just 'eh' to me!  I was just whelmed, not over or under!  The service at the bar leaves little to be desired!  I am not sure what it is about Scottsdale restaurants thinking they have to be snobby to people.  We ordered drinks from an un-friendly bartender and then waited another 20 minutes to even be acknowledged again!  

The food was ok!  The bf had the berrimundi which he liked but wasn't wild about the side it came with.  I had the meatloaf, which was good.  The gravy and mashed potatoes had a great creamy flavor.  My sister had the lamb burger with fries that were cold and not very tasteful.  There is not much on the wine list either.

I probably would not come back here because I dont think it was worth the hour wait for the crappy service at the bar.  I would rather venture down the road to Olive and Ivy.",0
"Another ""do-it-yourself"" bridal shop with rows of dresses tightly packed on racks in big plastic bags.   The woman was super quick swapping out the dresses in the room.  As soon as I walked out in a new dress, she had the old one out and the new one ready to go and waiting for me in my room.  I might have rated this store a bit higher, but I didn't seem to have any luck here.  Dresses were either way too big or way too small and I just didn't find any that I liked.  I have heard of many people having success here and the prices are reasonable, just didn't work for me.  The dress shopping continues. . .",0
"Met a group of people...great craft beer selection.. ordered Old World Salad w/House Dressing, excellent.. enough to feed 2-4 people..
then the Murphy pizza.. applewood smoked bacon and onions w/the thin crust, wood fired. This is an awesome pizza. The rest of the group got various  pizzas and loved everything! Our waitress was great, and took good care of us..",1
"First of all note the name changed to AMF Scottsdale Lanes.

Hey it doesn't smell! Its a nice bowling alley and I can imagine spending a few hours here like I did tonight with my Phoenix Fabulous Forty Women's Club. 

The bar is very nice for a bowling alley. They even have a pool table! 
They serve decent food and cold drinks to your lanes with waiter service. 

All the lanes, screens and scoring boards are new, clean and state of the art. There's no old smelly gross carpet to be avoided either, which is classic of bowling alleys I have been in! 

Prices for rental equipment and lane use is average cost. 

I had a great time and will definitely return to enjoy the faculties again and again. 

Oh and the staff were so nice and professional also!",1
"Loved it. Pulled pork & pulled chicken, bbq sauce & the cole slaw were ALL outstanding. ONLY caveat is that GPS tries to send you to thhe wrong side of the highway. It is in the shopping center with CVS & Circle K.",1
"I made it home for two nights, and I would do it again. It is extremely close to ASU's campus. It was clean, people were friendly and I got a free ride to the airport. It was a great price; normal mid-range hotel with no amazing views. It has the amenities you need for a quick visit-including a pool and gym. The free continental breakfast is ok, especially if you just want cereal. I would not order bacon-not worth $2 extra.",0
"Decided to give Tempe Marketplace another try after reading recent reviews (hoping that they had improved). I had to ask myself if we were visiting the same place. The traffic and parking situation are still horrible and the loudspeakers in the parking lot are unacceptable. The JC Pennys and Targets are crippled versions of their regular stores at other malls. The stores here all open too late (11am, REALLY???) to be useful in our uber hot summers (except for a Targets that opens at 8am). 
Even though I am a Tempe resident, I will continue to choose the Riverview shopping area on Dobson over this mish-mashed monstrosity.",0
"I don't know why it is that all these airports have such a major lack of seating.  The staff here are friendly, and security is quick, but I just wish they'd work on the gate areas and add more seats.  Need an example?  Sacramento International's new terminal.",0
Love this place.  Friendly staff. Always a treat to see what's cooking on the weekend. I don't mind standing in line to order. Great way to meet new friends and talk to old ones. Ask Kiersten about the cortadito.,1
Definitely a solid choice for some quick healthier alternatives.  Good Wraps with quality ingredients.,0
"Food poisoning alert. There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment. First off, the cook looks like somebody off the street, at least wear an apron buddy. 
   Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started. Five minutes later, I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended. Lastly, another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins. This place is full of local drunks, but a good watering hole (yeah literally). Go here to drink and stay away from all food. Also, it was 8 bucks for one order of skins. Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches. It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene. Bad choice.",0
"Given the high ratio of staff to customers, it took longer than expected to get acknowledged. However, my drink came out quickly, as did my food. The menu items all had cheesy names based on the Fox sportscasters, but that, along with the 24 TV's playing (you guessed it) sports, made it rather entertaining. The food quality was surprisingly good for an airport sports bar--burger was tasty, bacon was crispy but not burnt, and made with actual sharp cheddar cheese. 

Service was good too. Lorraine refilled my drink the instant it was empty, cleared the dishes and offered the check within a minute of pushing them away, and brought the receipt almost immediately. If I'd been rushing to catch a flight, I think I""d have been fine. Burger, fries, and unlimited Coke, plus tax and tip for just under $17; not too bad for an airport.

Overall, it was a bit like the US Olympic swimmers I was watching while I ate--a tad slow off the blocks, but came back impressively to win the gold.",1
"This place was just... okay. First I'd like to say that my bridal consultant (don't remember her name - sorry) was really nice and helpful. But to me most of the other saleswomen had ""desperation"" all over their faces (don't know if they work off of commission, or if the higher ups are just slave laborers, or what, but I'm sure some of them would've killed for a sale). I found a few dresses I liked, but they were way too high pressure for me to be able to make a solid decision on the spot, so I decided to wait on it. I ended up finding a dress I liked better for about 1/3 of the price somewhere else. I notified David's Bridal ""thanks but no thanks"" about 6 months ago. To this day I still get calls to my cell phone asking me to ""come back in and try on the dress""... they're like the telemarketers of the bridal world! So annoying. Plus their accessories are so expensive, and very cookie cutter. I'd go somewhere else, unless you're new to this and need some ideas.",0
"Typical chain ""southwestern/Tex Mex"" food in a corporatey atmosphere. They have some tasty dishes and a killer sunday brunch, but everything on the menu is kind of ambiguous.

Prices here are about on par with most places of this type (I put it in the Applebee's, TGI Friday's, Charleston's, etc.) category. 

I enjoyed my visit to this location better than my visits to the PV and Tempe locations.",0
"I couldn't agree with David more.  The owner is definitley an interesting  person.  The more money she thinks you make, the more she will talk to and love you!  So tell her you are RICH!! (Sorry Didi C.) As for the food -  Ho hum VN food at high for what you get prices.  The Pho is very avg and double the usual price. They don't charge a corkage fee for  BYOB which is nice.",0
"It was ok, there was a large group of us and we all enjoyed the appitizers, including the table side guac.  Biggest complaint was how poorly their bar was stocked.  No Chivas, no Sambuca, weak margaritas, etc.  So while the service was good, the food was just ok and the bar needs to be stocked better.  There is room for improvement.",0
"Hiking Camelback Mountain has to have been the most difficult 1 1/2 mile hike (Just up, 3 miles total) that I have ever been on. While it is not a very far distance the increase in elevation is over 1000 feet in that short mile and a half. 

The first thing that I recommend is either getting to Echo Park at bright and early (between 4:30-5:30 am) or, if you come later as I did just parking in the overflow parking. You can find a simple map to the overflow parking at: 

http://phoenix.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Camelback-Mountain-Trailhead-Overflow-Parking.png

The walk to the Echo Canyon trail head to the overflow parking is only about 20-25 minutes and it is almost guaranteed to be faster than driving around looking for a parking spot somewhere else. 

The trail itself takes about 20 minutes to actually get difficult but when it does decide to start getting hard it does not let up for a moment. There are chain link fences at a couple of places in the hike to stop people from accidentally tumbling over very steep ledges and even handrails at times for more support up the trickiest sections of the hike. 

The good and bad of this hike is how crowded it is. There will rarely be a moment where you wont see someone coming or going for more that 50 yards at a time. This means that while there is little to no quiet and privacy, that if something were to happen to you there would be plenty of witnesses.

The rest at the top is wonderful. The view is by far the best in the valley and something that I recommend to everyone. Take 20 minutes or so to eat a snack, drink some water, take a breather and take some breathtaking pictures from the summit. The summit is usually pretty crowded so you won't want to stay too long. 

Be careful on the way back. It can be very tricky navigating some of the areas and twisted ankles and even broken legs are not terribly uncommon. Again, take you time and take plenty of breaks when you need them and you should be OK.

Don't forget to take plenty of water, I recommend at least a liter per person if you go in the morning and more that that if you do in when it is warmer outside.",1
"The parking is my beef with this place.  Why does a customer have to pay $12 for each time we park at the garage?  If you move in and out three times, that's $36 for parking.  Yes, my company was paying, but this was just outright stupid and I wouldn't make my company pay for this again.
I've been to Phoenix twice since then, and I've avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.  Much better place.",0
"Cibo!   Eating outside is a major part of the experience even on a hot summer night in Phoenix!  Worth the dampness from head to toe.  The BONUS is sitting under the African tree with the lights and grapes with the FULL moon shining on us  ~

Our red haired waiter sporting 1950's style glasses was fun, fun, fun and pleasingly attentive.   We had white wine;  superb choice thanks to the 4 different wine tastes I received while choosing it.  

The strawberry/walnut salad was a bit dry, yet the feta was marvelous!  Great soft texture to melt in your mouth.  

The pizza was the sausage and it was wood fired, nice and perfect.  Just enough food for the 3 of us ~

So much food, just the right amount for our bellies.  For the 3 of us, the bill was only $43.00.  Not too bad on a Saturday night to go in 1/3's.

~ Luana Joya Lucia",1
"Went Saturday and got there just after opened at 11:00am as suggested by other yelpers. Glad we did as filled up quickly. Rate 4.5 stars as I'm a big fan of pub grub and atmosphere that goes with it. Would have been awesome if had a more brit/euro style feel by adding sports tele/bar music but that's being awfully picky, especially for such a small venue. Food was great, huge selection but could have been a tad warmer (my choice). Beer choices good, unfortunately out of my first pick but can't knock 'em too bad for that, and a bit warmer as well (again, my choice). Wait staff very friendly and efficient. Didn't have any unusual wait for service considering crowd. Prices I thought were reasonable, and we left full and satisfied. Definitely will be back again.",1
"Just had Daphnes for the last time. In the 3 times that we have ordered from them, they cannot seem to get a simple order right. One Kids Burger with Apple Slices (Nope) one side of hummus(Nope) But they are quick to charge you for the order. Then you call and talk to a girl name Liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong. Even though I have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus. HMMMMM,.. keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline. We are an office in Scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office, Daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book.

Nice customer service!!!!!!",0
I love this place. Every time I visit I come here. I did miss out of Bucket of Crab night :(,1
"On my way to the Airport, I decided to stop at Ted's for a bite to eat.  Being that I live really close to this place, and have never tried it before, I thought this would be a prime time to check this place out.

Well, it was alright.  Nothing special on the interior, and even though I was not blown away by my experience here, I really did enjoy myself.  We waited in line, and I ordered a jumbo beef hot dog, with Chili.  Austin got a sausage, with some of the fixings, and fries.  We both liked it, and I plan on returning again soon.  Pretty good!",0
"Mediocre food, mine was really really salty.  Kind of an interesting place though, looks like a Colorado lodge but what's that decor doing in Arizona??  Looks like a good place to go after work for happy hour and hangin with friends, so-so for a nice dinner.",0
"even after 1.5 hours wait i loved the atmosphere and did not mind the wait at all. the service was good. not too friendly but everything we needed was on table. 
Disappointment was domestic Kobe burger. it was served overdone (just little pink in center after i ordered it medium - rare) it is served with Asian slaw ( peanut dressing) which is served on top of the burger. It was way too strong and it took away from the burger itself. it was hard to taste the meat with so much peanut sauce in the slaw. If i was to order this dish again, i would ask for slaw on the side. the fries were fantastic and fried cheese was very good. 
i will definitely be back for more for my friends loved their burgers. 
the 3 stars is for the fact that burger was way overdone and i could not taste the major component to that dish - Meat!",0
"I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review. I've had donuts since then from other donut shops, but none compare to Bosa. The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others. You can't go wrong with the donut holes.",1
"I stopped in one afternoon and ordered some baba and a chicken salad. The baba was good, and served with a ton of pita quarters. The salad was good too, except that most of the chicken was burnt. 
The cashier was pleasant and must be related to the guys doing the cooking. They were giving her a hard time about a male customer who I guessed must come in a lot and she was giving it right back to them! Kinda funny. I will definitely be back for takeout and lunch again while shopping. I will go for the gyro salad next time though.",1
"I live no where near this place & have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times! I haven't been since it moved (bc I had no idea where they went) but it looks like it's bigger so that's great. I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here. I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way). It can get really busy at lunch, so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work. I did that once, and got in and out just fine, but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch. Everything is delicious, but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must!",1
"Bless these folks for letting us sit in a pleasant, non-crowded setting, with whole tables and use free wi-fi.  With their wonderful and affordable 1/2 sandwich/soup deal and an iced tea I can sit and do homework for a few hours.  (Their roast beef and gargonzola sandwich with roasted red peppers is a nice variation...)  They have good lighting, decent music and lots of outlets to plug my laptop into.  This is a much more tolerable way to study than that little crowded coffee place....",1
"WOW!  From service to food, 5 stars!    Went here last night for our 10th anniversary.   They never cease to amaze us.   Husband had a Caesar salad, Rib Eye with crab legs and I had a salad with Balsamic Vinagrette,  Salmon with Asian glaze with a carrott and swiss chard medley.  Amazing!!   Perfection.  Kyle served us, we were impressed by his knowledge of the menu and attention to detail.    Everyone we came in contact with was pleasant.  If only more restaurants treated their patrons this way!  If you have their VIP card you also earn 'points' which convert into $ you can use towards a future visit.    Thanks Kyle and McCormick and Schmicks!!",1
"The line was ridiculous.  The price is kind of steep for what it is.  The dog is kind of messy because of the way it's made.  But you know what?  I enjoyed it in a way I haven't enjoyed a hot dog in years!  Wow, that sounds kind of dirty.  This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods.

I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs.  I can't say much too much that hasn't already been said.  While the 20 minute wait wasn't too thrilling, it all paid off in the end.  I just went with a traditional wiener, with tomatoes, onion, relish and spicy mustard.  While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dog's specialties, most of the dogs on today's menu contained an item or two that I don't really like, and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around.  Good sausage, good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic. 

I would happily join Lindsey F. by tying my leash to the cart and following them around town.  And I didn't even know that I still enjoyed hot dogs that much without a beer and a game!",1
"This is about a 3.5 star mexican place to me. I've always had good service but watched other folks get like 1-star service, at a level I might not come back.

I like the White Chimichanga here. The Chili Verde is decent, and the Hatch Chilis are nice too, if you haven't had those.

4 Stars - White Chimi
3 Stars - Chili Verde
3 Stars - Cheese crips with Hatch chilis

I'm sure there are better places around but I've been coming here for several years when in the area, and I definitely enjoy this place.

Sometimes they have hot chicks working up front. If you keep up this practice Arriba, I'll five-star you sometime soon!",1
"I don't know if I should say I love this place or really dislike them.  They are dangerous.  It's like they know my number.  I was supposed to just passed by and head to another store, but I couldn't help it. I saw the shoe sale, they have it every few months now.  Tons of shoes for 65% off.  I guess a girl cannot have enough shoes.  Hey, my pretty shoes don't care if I gain or loose a few pounds.  Today, I got 3 more pairs. Danny helped me out, he has been in the shoe department forever.  I remember him helping me since 2006 at least, wow, that is 6 years now.
I love some of the Gianni Binni Dresses, too (that is the house brand).  They are very well made and if you are lucky enough to catch them on one of the big sales you can score a great dress for under $80.00",1
"I took my family here using a groupon and it was just ok.  We tried to go on Monday however we arrived at 4:30 and the employee working the counter informed us that league play was going to begin at 5:30 so our hour would be cut short.  I was a little irritated with her ""um, yeah sorrry"" but whatever.  We opted to come back the next day to get our full hour.  When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly gentlemen who provided us our shows and assigned our lane.  We were one of 3 groups in the alley and they placed us side by side instead of giving us a little space.  My wife asked for a glass of water that never came.  So the bowling was fun.  The service was marginal at best.  The lane assignment was awful.  Since we only paid $15 for 4 people for the hour including shoe rental I will go back again for the same deal.  I would never go there paying full price which is outrageous.",0
"Checked in last night with a large group of people and gotta say: the staff is super professional and very nice. Clean, quiet rooms. Amenities are quite as nice as the Marriott (small pool), but there is free WiFi (connection is good and consistent) and breakfast and dinner snacks come with your room. So, good value.",1
"I love the always smiling crew and food is delicious.
50cents coffee in the morning outside tables with sun exposure and friendly clientele, all this in the beautiful kierland commons
Good morning America",1
"Dim lighting. Fleet Foxes. Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret. Band of Horses. Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be. The Shins. Black board specials, just because they look cool. Beirut. $13 vegetable dishes. 

Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it.

Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, you're a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and it's fantastic. If you're depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate, the flat breads are taste-gasmic. That crust... the things I'd do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust. Top it off with figs and ricotta, and there's no way I'm passing up a square or two... or seven. If you're still not sold on the idea of carb-loading, the salmon ""superfood"" is delicious and nutritious, and who's not into a little super(food)iority now and then?

But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It was just so damn... moist. There, I said it. Moist. Moist. Moist. Ew. But really, yum. If caffeine, chocolate and alcohol don't suit your fancy (wimp), the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful. Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake. Layered. In a jar. Who thought of that? Someone with adorable thoughts, that's who. 

And let's be honest, you've earned dessert. I mean... you ordered a healthy, vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger, right? Right. Of course you did.",1
"Ahh man,
.....I REALLY wanted this to be good.

But honestly, you end up with something that's more like ""flame broiled"" than the earthy wood-fired imagery you pick up from their corporately consistent signage, menu, and decor.

That being said, it's a cool concept, and great crust- but the signature pizzas like the ""Greek"" end up feeling themed ,and lacking of soul and an intuitive fussing-over that they need to really be crack good.

The salad's, while seemingly possessing all the right stuff- are the same. Too salty/ too soggy, and somehow too rich.
The gelato tastes like it must come from a squeeze tube.

Anyhow- enough bitching. Better than Pizza Hut, but for all the fuss and flash, you expect alot more.",0
"OMG! I am so frustrated at this store, I have never met such an incompetent group of people in my entire shopping life. 

First, I called Fry's Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe. I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store. The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe. I asked again those models have maps of Europe? ""Yes and Australia too"". And you have those models in stock? ""Yes."" What is the price range? ""$100 to $300"". Thank you. FIRST MISINFORMATION! 

So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird, talked with ""GPS Specialist"" (which apparently means nothing) and he (Jared) informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps!! He said the call center ""is a bunch of retards"" and that those were all last years models. 

Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units. When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them! (okay not confident in your product knowledge). Then he sold me a $260 unit with European maps. SECOND MISINFORMATION. 

I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps! I had to buy them for another $100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS.

So I drive back to Fry's. Speak with a Supervisor, they return my first GPS. I speak with the same sales rep (ya thats great). He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps. 

So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps, according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for $129.  THIRD MISINFORMATION. Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper. 

I then went home bought the $100 European map and couldn't download it to my GPS because there wasn't enough space available!!!

Now I have to buy a miniSD Card and a miniSD reader for my Mac book. Awesome. Great to know that the electronic store knows nothing about electronics!",0
"You speak Italian to me and provide mouth watering, soul lifting coconut gelato with micro-chips of chocolate in them?!  I only wish you weren't 30 miles away...but I would walk in 116 degree heat to get there - for real!",1
"Hike #4 for 2010 was North Mountain Park.  Got there around 10:30am on a Sunday.  Sunny and wonderful weather!  We got a parking near Trail #44.  We hiked up trail #44, it was strenuous but we needed a little more so we went down the pavement and off to this little trail that led us to trail #101.  Cool!  It was a little declines/inclines and between two mountains.  The scenary was goregous!  We walked until we hit trail #100 and we took a left.  Walked and walked..  Watched people walk their dogs & people riding horses.  Neat!  We got to where the trail ended.  Hum?  Went off to trail #60 then.  Another strenuous hike and it was a circle.  Circled back to trail #100 and we back tracked all the way back.  3-1/2 hours later we were back at the car.  

Man, my calves are SORE today!",1
"this place is growing on me. i wasn't a big fan at the beginning thinking they cater to the yuppy crowd that wants to be seen. i still think that's the case, but i think people truly go for the atmosphere and good food. the vig cobb is really tasty and you just can't go wrong with sweet potato fries...my weakness! the interior is really cool and creative and the vibe is casual and friendly. lunch hour tends to get a little busy, but they have a decent amount of seating for such a small place.",1
Another excellent find in Scottsdale.  The service is wonderful and the food is extremely flavorful with good size portions.  The sea scallops and herb chicken are highly recommended.,1
The food here was really good. I ordered the sesamie chicken and the sauce was very good. The service was marginal at best but it didn't annoy me. I'd go back,1
"Oooooh, I liked it, very much so!  Just sad that I didn't get to try more of its myriad offerings, especially the pizza.  We enjoyed a lovely brunch here on a Friday.  Cute little place, lots of ambiance, good people watching (quite the hopping place on this midsummer day), tasty food.  We had a round of Bloody Marys, and those were nicely done, as well.  A great spot to just hang and nosh and chitchat with friends.",1
"This is true personal training at a fraction of the cost. It's fast, convenient, clean & friendly! You choose the style of fitness YOU want, and your workout program will be designed specifically for YOU. And you will see your progress after each session. AWESOME!!! I like it so much I'm going 6 days a week!",1
"I've never had a bad meal at Z-Tejas.  My favorite is the Jerk Chicken Salad, but I've also had some great scallops there.  The cornbread is always delicious, and they're famous for their margaritas.",1
"We had a great meal here!
I started with the cheap salad as I was craving salad.  HIt the spot.
Hubby started with smashed irishman drink and loved.  He moved onto a draft beer.
I moved onto Fish and Chips-they were light and just the right size.
Hubby had beef stroganoff-he said it was tasty.
We ended with the fabulous salted caramel-my fav thing of the night.
I think the bill was $62 before tip-pretty reasonable to me.",1
I love this place!! Great food and service..portions are Hugh..,1
I took my son who has been living in Sweden to Angels since he likes good beer.  And he was noy disappointed.  The price was right for the quality of the beer.  We also enjoyed the food I had the sweet potatoe tacos and the were great.  He loved that so many varieties of good beers were on tap.  Definitely going again especially if all three of my son's are home.   Good beer good food good people,1
"After looking for a car wash & vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis & Sons. I checkeed thier priced on thier website, but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more, they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning, and then said I don't take care of my care so there would be an additional $20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces. I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum. They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there. Needless to say I didn't get my car washed there. I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks.",0
"Not that good, not that bad.  So-so, more or less.

Stopped by here for lunch the other day, I had the BBQ chicken lunch.  Overall a pretty bland taste, but maybe that is just the style.  If I ever end up here again I may try something else, but I won't be going out of my way to do so.",0
"we went here for dinner and drinks, and it was awesome. the giant soft pretzels are amazing, buttery, and delicious and are served with a roasted pepper cheese sauce. they are awesome, but get them to share, the butteryness is rich! the prices are reasonable, and the patio is nice to sit out on! even better than the food, service, and prices is the music!! they play an awesome selection of music!!",1
"Umm is it possible to give MORE than 5 stars!??! My girlfriend believes, Duane is AMAZING, and hands DOWN the best handyman ever. We stumbled upon him and had him come to the house to fix a ceiling fan that had fallen out of the ceiling completely. Yikes... His charge was reasonable for coming by about $40ish and he really goes above and beyond especially with quality and letting you know the facts. 

This was a house full of girls and often times when they are clueless they try to pull a fast one, NOPE, not Duane. He is honest, and very caring. When he was leaving he noticed the door had a stick to it and brought back something from his vehicle and fixed it for free!

Most recently, my girlfriend called him at nearly 9pm to tell him her disposal stopped working. He immediately remembered her as the house with the three dental students and exactly where she lived (even though he had last been there a year ago) and walked her through how to fix it over the phone, for free. 

This guy really is the epitome of what everyone wants and needs in a handyman! Call him for ANY home issue you may need help with!",1
"I went to this place with my wife because it was new and we're always looking for new places to eat. We were the only two people in the place and would have thought that the owner, to make a good impression and show gratitude for what business he did have might have come by the table to ask how the food is, make small talk or anything. He sat at their front counter watching a baseball game when we got there. The waitress took our order, he went back to cook it and resumed his place at the counter to watch the game. We felt like we were putting the guy out to have to pull away and actually cook for the only two customers he had. 

As far as the food is concerned: You can grill a great burger at home with decent meat and the fixin's you want to  put on it. In other words, it wasn't anything special and certainly nothing that I would go back for. 
Bottom line: Scottsdale doesn't need another $9.00 burger place and I wish the staff could have put more effort to appreciate our patronage.",0
"I'm a complete dive bar junkie. Whether I'm in a big city, or small town I always seek out the local spots. I was in Tempe with work and we happened to drive into town right at last call so we searched for the closest bar which just happened to be Monkey Pants. After we got over laughing at the name and the paint job on their truck...we went in and were greeted by the waitress right away. It wasn't too busy especially for a Friday night but the place is huge! The bartender was very attentive and adorable. 

 I really wish I could've made another stop at this bar before I went back home..I saw a bunch of posters for all these theme nights and great deals. Reading previous reviews it sounds like they have parties going on like this all the time. Great bar!",1
"Like many of my fellow Yelpers, I too take issue with the ladies at the MAC counter, but not necessarily Nordstrom's as the ""store.""  After using my pressed powder compact to the point of ""crumbs,"" I prepared for battle and a trip to the mall.  But, before leaving home, I checked my email for sales and specials.  What I discovered is the best thing ever!  Yes, this is drum roll worthy - so start tapping!  Nordstrom's offers FREE shipping & FREE returns!  Every item on the website regardless of price can be shipped to your door for (in case you didn't get it the first time) FREE!  Needless to say I put down the sword, took off my armor, and ordered my compact online.  I am now ""crumb-free!""",0
"You know when you make a copy of the original and its not quite the same? Juts a little fuzzy around the edges, not as sharp but usable? That is how I felt at the new location of Market Bistro. Similar vibe that I enjoy at the original isn't quite as pulled together at this location. Maybe the lack of a lounging area or the weird particle board chic tables? Or the fact that every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace (front entrance).. maybe the grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill? No forks? I'm sorry if I sound like a banging on MB.. but these are things that can be improved on. 

The Mr and I shared a salad and a Cuban sandwich.. the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making.. this was probably the best salad Ive made to date.. you should be able to patent your creations! The Cuban sandwich was okay.. the ciabatta rolls are so thick and chewy that when you take a bite the toppings sort of fire out the back.. for a Cuban sandwich I think it had some sort of Asian spice, like cardemom?? Anyway, the Mr didn't like it at all. This being his first time he was confused as to why I went on and on until he took a bite of my patent pending salad, then it all made sense to him. The salads are just so complete and delicious!

I look forward to coming again.. I just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely.",0
"Me and my sis were greeted with a pleasant smile and I like the whole $5 part with the coke and fries. I dont really enjoy drinking soda but I'll take it anyway especially if its fruity, they have all the old school pop in cans Shasta and RC I should learn to take more pics but this place is cramped inside and I may be claustrophobic. I had the portabello mushroom burger see pic it had rice and all this other stuff that just kinda fell out all over the place it was super messy but pretty tasty. The fries are soggy which ordinarily we wouldnt eat but they were really good we couldnt stop eating them. We sat on the back patio and got checked on by I am assuming was the owner she asked how we liked it, was way nice I love the friendliness of the place we left hekka full and happy! Next time we go we will probably just share an order of fries though.",1
"The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable. 

The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price. The cheese is amazing! 

I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on). 

I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food. 

I highly recommend El Bravo.",1
"We went to the game against the Milwaukee Brewers on 3/25/10 and had a great time (and not just because the Dodgers won).  We arrived early enough to walk around outside the whole stadium and see the practice fields.  We even saw Tommy Lasorda, himself, outside at a table giving autographs!

Parking was free (sort of; it was included in the price of the tickets), and we were able to park close because we were early.  Traffic leaving was ""typical Frank McCourt"" style, meaning that it could have been better.  Exiting traffic was set up to force us out in the wrong direction, so it was good to have the car's GPS guide us back to the freeway.

We were surprised to see that not all of the food/drink stands were open, but I think they had only sold about 60-70% tickets for that game (Thursday 1:00 game).  There was plenty of berm (grass) seating.  We had splurged for premium seats ($42 each) for the game, and were almost right behind home plate in the seats that had seat cushions and cup holders.  My BF was very pleased with the beer selections (Full Sail and Deschutes, not just the typical Miller and Bud offerings).  They finally brought in Dodger dogs this year - boiled with short buns, nothing special.  I still prefer them grilled.

Stadium staff was all very friendly, esp the beer guy in our section who said my BF looked like some movie star.  On behalf of the concession staff... FRANK, GIVE THEM SOME SHADE!  The beer/food stands outside of the actual buildings only had slatted roofs, so no sun protection at all, and no misters.  The poor people were totally roasting, and that was annoying to see.

One odd thing about the Stadium is that it faces SE, which puts every single seat in the sun during day games.  Wear a hat and bring your sunblock.  Lots of sunblock.

All in all, it was a very nice experience, and we're glad we went to the game and to Camelback Ranch.  Only a 5.5 hour drive from home, we'll probably do it again.",1
"Ok so there are plenty of great reviews of this place already but I'm going to throw mine into the mix as well. 

The food here is fantastic, but if you've ever walked in there around lunch time you could probably figure that out from the crowd. Everytime I come in I try a new one and I'm always happy with it, I've yet to come across a pasty I didn't like here.

When it comes out you might not think it's that much - but portions are deceiving because the food's pretty heavy. My main tip to you is only eat half and then pause to let it sink in - take a break to drink your beer or something. I always force myself to save the second half and it makes me much less sleepy when I head back to work after lunch :) Plus it makes great leftovers.",1
"Southwest blows its competitors so far out of the water I actually feel bad for the other airlines.  
1. Of the countless times I've flown with them, my flight has been delayed only twice and both times less than one hour.
2. NO BAG FEES.  
3. Nine times out of ten the lowest price.
4. Killer customer service, laced with sarcasm, veiled cynicism, and high efficiency.  I love it.
5. They never give me an inquisitive look when I order a cocktail on the super early morning flights.  Thank you for not judging me, SW Flight Attendants.",1
"This place is too freaking cute!!!  The OJ is literally one of the best glasses I've ever had.  I had the typical eggs, bacon, and toast and it was amazing.  The bacon was crispy without being burnt, the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness.  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing, and the touch of apple put it over the top.  Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard.  I will definitely be back to this cozy establishment!",1
"Came in for my birthday burger, and decided on the garden-burger.  I hadn't tried it before, but I'll be trying it again, many more times.  I may even go vegetarian now that this baby is in my dietetic arsenal.  Love it!",1
"True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, you'll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weil's food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - it's not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrew's Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time I'd like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, ""Well, they're all fresh-frozen."" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but they're fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weil's philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream.",1
One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix.  I love it.,1
"My family and I ate here Saturday night.....based on the reviews of Yelp.
We were not disappointed, as a matter of fact, we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening.  When you arrive at Bobby Q's, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant. They had wonderful mood lighting! I love low mood lighting!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our meals were excellent.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.  We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!  I don't care if it feel apart at least it wasn't dry!  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.  I really loved it and I love steak.  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I don't usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.  Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grill's chicken!  It was tasty.  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.  Our food was excellent, there wasn't one thing we didn't like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!",1
"I love scallops, and the scallops at The Breadfruit were simply the best. On the weekend, The Breadfruit is open till 11pm and its Rum Bar is open till midnight, which makes this a great late-night haunt: pick your favorite rum drink and share a scallop appetizer for the perfect lite end to the evening. The servers were excellent and handled my gluten allergy easily, offering suggestions and slight modifications to the dishes. The Breadfruit is located at 108 East Pierce, which is south of Roosevelt and just east of First Street. Put this place as a must on your late-night hit list.",1
"Came for the beer, stayed for the scenery.",1
"The best gyro you will have in Arizona...
or maybe anywhere.

Love the grocery selection.
Everyone there is really nice.
And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6.",1
"Great Italian food with portions designed to share.

And it was a good thing our waiter brought that to our attention (he must have heard our comments on the prices).  We ordered 2 half portions and one full (lobster ravioli, a brick of lasagna, and something else I couldn't pronounce) and it was just enough for the 4 of us.  After the alcohol we even kept the bill under $100.  I would definately recommend this place, just be sure to bring a few friends and an appetite!",1
"I'm always on the lookout for cool places to bring out of town friends and this place seemed to fit the bill.  It's a sustainable farm that produces Arizona's only extra virgin olive oil.  I came in for lunch and as I pulled into the GRAVEL parking lot my stomach turned because I had expensive heels on and knew they were going to take a beating (I know, ""waaah"" right? But there are women out there that love their shoes as much as I do and will appreciate the heads-up).  Once I entered the Olive Mill I was delighted to see how adorably quaint it was inside.  The building was split in two, market on one side, bistro on the other with seating in between both and also outside.  The market had testers of all their products, great idea but the food testers didn't seem sanitary so I didn't try anything.  I ended up buying some awesome hand balm that I love.  They had a really great wine selection as well.  

Alright so here's the bad part.  The entire time I was there, not one employee greeted me or cracked a smile.   There was one guy in particular that was going back and forth stocking shelves and was visibly annoyed by my presence.  When I went to order my sandwich, I remembered I got a free drink with my Yelp check-in.  The girl at the counter sighed and rolled her eyes as I scrambled through my purse to find my iphone and she said ""forget it, I got it.""  Their sandwich the ""Kalamata"" had its 15 seconds of fame on the food network so I was going to get that but opted for the ""Lucca"" at the last second because it has brie...I love brie more than I love most family members.  The sandwich was a disappointment.  All the ingredients were there but it was devoid of any flavor and I couldn't figure out why.  

I probably won't be bringing any of my homies here but I will drop by to buy products, I fully support local businesses.",0
Awesome place. Staff is very helpfull!,1
"Just off University, but manages to feel like a little hide-away, and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere, suitable for intimate conversation.

Fish Tacos and a Margarita again please! How many times before I can force myself to experiment?",1
"I'm staying at a hotel in Tempe so I decided to let Yelp direct me to a sushi joint for dinner.  After reading several reviews, decided to try Sushi Eye since it was less than 5 miles from my hotel.

I orered the following:  Sashimi Plate (tuna, salmon, yellowtail), Hamachi Kama (grilled yellowtail collar), and Uni (sea urchin).

POSITIVES:
--  Price was very reasonable.  Total cost was $40 including tip.
--  The food was fresh and the portion sizes were great.  Even the Uni was extremely fresh and the amount was more than reasonable.
--  The Sashimi Plate came with soup and salad.  The dressing on the salad was excellent.

NEGATIVES:
--  The green tea was lukewarm and the waiter/waitress did not do a good job of ensuring my tea cup was always full.
--  It takes a very long time for the food to come out.  There were only 3 or 4 tables besides me so it wasn't a busy night.  
--  This is an odd one but I actually wished the Hamachi Kama didn't have so much meat on it.  Due to the large/thick amount of flesh, it didn't not have the crisp chargrilled taste to it.  Probably another reason why it took so long for it to be prepared.

Overall, I give it 4 stars.  I would definately go back and may tomrrow night.",1
"I cannot say enough about how much I LOVE We Care Family Wellness Center! I refer everyone I know to them. Dr. Ross, Cheryl, and everyone on staff are truly wonderful. They genuinely care about you as a person and always make you feel like you are the only patient on the planet whenever they are with you. They are never rushed and will take all the time in the world to listen to you and figure out what's going on with you. After having seen more doctors than I care to remember, I feel so blessed that I have found such amazing healthcare providers!",1
"Imagine this, a swanky new Scottsdale restaurant that has down to earth prices, fantastic food and attentive top-notch service? Sometimes it's hard to believe that this kind of place even exists, but its no mirage, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is everything that I had hoped and more. 

Starting with the service, there are details that just go to show how the owners and management are in tune with training of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine. 

I have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, you'll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn't love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that'll come later.

The ""Shooters"" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame. 

If you're still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey ""Chop"" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share. 

The center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious. 

While the space feels decidedly modern and upscale there wasn't one moment where I felt uncomfortable or out of place, even with burger juices running down my face.",1
"Now accepts plastic!  Now accepts plastic!  Did you hear me?  Harvey's now accepts plastic!

I've lived around the corner from Harvey's for a little over 4 years now.  I had lunch there once in the mid 1990's, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon.  Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago.  

While I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me.  I'm young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted.  Sad, really.  The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasn't happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.  And I don't mean the freaks like me.  I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones.  There's a difference!

Well, enter the new roommate.  He was disinclined to believe my review, and insisted we go.  I resisted until late Saturday night, when he came home at 1am and insisted I get dressed so we could go there for an hour.  Maybe I was tired.  Maybe I needed a change of pace.  Whatever the reason, I gave in, got dressed and we walked over to Harvey's.

YAY!  According to Echo, the bartender (yes, it's her real name.  her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year.  It shows!  

Echo is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar!  Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu.  She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ!

June drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I don't remember what else.  I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat.  (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!).  The pour is solid and consistent  Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks?  For $2!!
Two drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us.  Under $14!!  Holy hell, it's cheaper to drink here than it is at home!

And at home - we don't have the entertainment of the other patrons.  Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand.  And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of ""rodeo"" with his girlfriend. You just can't make this up!
Oh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname.
Apparently, I am a ""prick ass bitch.""  I don't know how he meant it, but I am taking it as a compliment and will wear it with pride!

Oh, yes.  I will certainly be back!  A LOT.",1
"I didn't go back again.  The haircut turned out to be worse than I thought, being quite unmanageable.  I ended up going back to the local Mexican barber, who charged 12 bucks for a pretty decent haircut.

I think they gave better massages than they did haircuts.  Still, it wasn't a bad place, and one could do worse.",0
"This is only a Review of there men's restroom....

It was like 2:30am X-mass eve...well really X-mass.....and

since I knew someone that once got busted for peeing on Scottsdale Galleria (I'm sure they weren't the first ones.)....I asked a bouncer if I could still use there restroom....and I was able too......PLUS one star

oh of course there was no ""attendant"" at this time to stare at your ass wile you piss.....so that's a Plus....still not sure why you tip them for that....

If your going to pay someone to watch you pee wouldn't you rather it be a girl? 

and how do you get the job to be the ""Attendant"" in the women's restroom? 

oh cool Orange ""floating Sinks"" Black paint every where....lots of urinals...pretty thin between them.......

cool little table things......wait wheres the trash?....

alright well I definitely recommend the Bathroom....I wouldn't drive out of the way for it.....But I'm certainly going back.......",1
"4 stars for the place itself and it's food/coffee.
0 stars for the service, or lack there of.  My business partner and I were in town for a convention.  We heard we should check out Lola.  So we did.  We were excited.  The lady (I use the term loosely here) who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful.  We asked a few questions.  She barely answered us, then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.  An example.  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.  She mumbled something about the bar/table.  My partner walked over and saw no cups.  She came back and asked where the cups were.  On the table came an exasperated retort.  I walked over to inspect for myself.  There were no cups on the table.  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table, if so there appeared to be none.  She said they are on the table, but *sigh* I'll go check, but I know they're there!  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.  I watched this lady serve other customers.  It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience.  Newcomers or people she doesn't like are treated worse than the dirt on the bottom of her shoes.

My suggestion to management, adjust her attitude or get rid of her!  She is not good for business.",0
"The Doubletree is the resort we go to when we don't feel like paying to much for Scottsdale resort.  They have good rate rooms if you are a triple A members also.

The pools are fabulous just a place to go and hang out for the day if you don't fee like checking out the Scottsdale area.

The bed are OK I can't say its the best night sleep, but they do serve their purpose.  The rooms could be nicer, our bathtub had slow drain so I was standing in dirty water while taking a shower.

This last stay I did order room service and they said it would take 45 mins, but it took more then an hour for it to get to me and all I ordered was a salad.  They were doing some kind of construction with some of the rooms, so it was noisy during the mid day.",0
"Excellent family owned business that knows how to make real Italian dishes!  Their prices are a little on the high side but you get plenty and it's good.  We had enough left over for next day's lunch. 

The waiter was nice and attentive even though it started to get packed at around 7ish. They even gave us free Amaretto drinks after dinner! :)  Going back for another romantic dinner soon.",1
"I'm almost hesitant to tell you about my favorite sushi place because it's already pretty busy...  But oh well.  I love Sakana.  It's a comfortable restaurant, I don't feel like I have to get all dressed up to go there.  Don't let the fact that it's in a strip mall turn you off, inside is small, but nice.  Their sushi chefs are always very professional and keep their bar very clean- that's so important when dealing wih sashimi.  We've taken a lot of people to Sakana and it has never disappointed.  We have tried almost all their special rolls and love their sashimi too.  Their service staff are authentic and sweet.   I've never been disappointed.

Now....stay away...cause I don't want to wait for a table....",1
"Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $12 on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesn't really taste like anything, just like at Wendy's. The bun tastes mass-produced. 

I also don't especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. I'm not generally one for mushy, thick, ""natural"" fries of the sort served here. 

I can't help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup. 

I would rank the burger places around mill as:
1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries
2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat
3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries
4) Five Guys,
5) Fatburger, seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger?",0
"I was excited to check out Sleepy Dog after seeing all of it's 4 and 5-star reviews, and finally made it in. I must say...both beers I enjoyed were delicious. Establishment itself is small but unique and modern, and their whole theme around dogs rocks. The only drawback, is they do not serve food....well, the whole reason I went here was to meet up with a friend for dinner and a beer or two. I was shocked at this. We ended up having a pizza delivered from a pizza place down the street, which went well with our beers. One great thing, was they have a ton of flat screens all around. One had a corny late 80's action movie playing which was very entertaining, and something you don't experience everyday. All in all, I did like Sleeping Dog, and would like to go back. I saw the popcorn maker as we left! Beer was just as good/better than the other breweries in the area.",1
I was really pleased with Bombay Spice..it's definitely not your typical Indian restaurant setting.. Think more contemporary American decor... I mean The Smiths were playing on the stereo which gave it a nice relaxing casual vibe. We were served by a great friendly waitress who really knew the food and explained everything real well.. You can tell she was very excited about it. We started with the appetizer sampler which had four selections of appetizers of your choosing..all were outstanding especially the wings and the chickpea ceviche.  I then tried the Chicken Tikka Masala which had lots of great flavor and a nice kick then we checked in on Yelp and got a free dessert. Great prices and the way you order the food makes it really simple.. Great little casual place tucked away in the corner of a strip mall near PV mall.,1
"I love their food. Everything has been delicious, though my favorite is ""Bahn Mi"" inspired fish sandwich. Get it with a side of kale salad!",1
"This place is the truth. It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. The chile colorado is so good, it made me try to slap my mama. The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell. Awesome. Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m. Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, grab any combo and revel in the gluttony.",1
"I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  

My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  It was all so delicious!  

I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  Again, it was very tasty!  

 Everyone was very friendly and prompt.  I will be back to Upper Crust!",1
"I have received two pedicures and a manicure from this location.  I usually prefer a more spa like experience but the cost is low and I was attempting to save a few dollars.  Cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care.  I won't be returning because I am concerned about health violations.

Pros:
Quick service
Cheaper than the spa, salon

Cons:
Improper cleaning of foot baths.  I thought they were good until I saw them seat a women at a used station.  They only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl.  (I did let her know)

The foot massage was more like a foot beating.  About an hour later my ankles felt like I had rolled them.  It took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again.

The sent in the shop is of fake nails.  If everyone has on a mask, I would like one to.",0
"FINALMENTE!!!

Andiamo....

FOOD
--------
Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.

Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". 

And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.

The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. 

And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.

As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. 

SERVICE
-------------
Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. 

And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. 

SETTING
-------------
I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. 

The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. 

I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. 

EXTRA CRIB NOTES
-----------------------------
* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.
* It's great
* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.
* it's great
* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). 
* it's great
* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.
* it's great
* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?
* did I tell you it's great?

ALL IN ALL
---------------
An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. 

I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.

And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...",1
These guys know their stuff.  Professional staff and great location.,1
"Really great finds. Helped me stock a vintage 60's bar.  Ron is very helpful and knows where everything is in the store.  Great at finding knick nacks such as distressed wood, door knobs, irons, kitchen wares, etc.  Something for everyone.",1
Back in high school I used to work in metrocenter and this place still has the best lemonade I have ever had. I have not eaten the food from here so I have no idea on the quality.,1
"It was a quick trip downtown from Mesa, I didnt like some of the people getting on the train but hey its public transport. My legs were also hurting from the seats on the short trip downtown I have RLS and man it hurt for days after. It was great for saving gas and if I worked by one I would take it daily. This was my first time so watch where you park by the pickup locations cause I got my car towed, $200 fine!!! I would take it downtown again but park in the right spot this time.",1
The new leaner breakfast sandwiches are good (they basically take the bottom and top of the bagel and you are left with smaller ends of your sandwich). An easy way to cut calories without losing the taste.,0
Great store but lack of certain items,1
"Very good food. The tepanyaki was great!

It does have a certain atmosphere though. Remember to dress appropriately. It can also be a bit pricey.",1
"This is the place to go in Scottsdale for an Italian beef.  When I visit Chicago I usually go to Al's or Portillo's for Italian beef and having Al's here saves me the trip to the Windy City.

The decor here is nice with several motorcycles displayed throughout the restaurant for some reason.  It's neat and clean and plenty of helpful employees provide relatively quick service.

I ordered the regular Al's beef with sweet peppers.  I usually don't order my sandwiches ""wet"" because they come with plenty of juice already.  Good flavor and just the right size.  The fries were thick but a little greasy for my taste.

All in all, a good lunch and a place to keep in mind when I'm feeling like a taste of Chicago.",0
"My girlfriend liked this place more than I did. It may be that I'm spoiled by eating asian food in the Bay Area, but this place just didn't cut it. Unfortunately we both got red curry based dishes, so my experience was fairly limited... I got Duck w/red curry, and was not very impressed at all. The duck was tasty, but the curry was VERY bland. Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. 

The service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of ""everything is good, just order something so I can go home"". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it. 

It wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back. The yelp definition of 2 stars is ""Meh. I've experienced better"", and I think that description fits my meal perfectly.",0
"I take the light-rail downtown sometimes just to go here. I walked in the first time to a bustling, energetic, singing, cheering crowd and thought, ""where the H am I??"" I felt like I had left Phoenix and ended up in a far away magical land of wonder and excitement. Food is decent for a bar, great beer, great local music (it's the first time I saw The Waters). Downtown Phoenix needs more places like this.",1
"Delish! We drove around looking for a good steak without a wait and ended up at the Phoenician. With the restaurant concept by Jean Georges, we knew we were in for a treat. 

The only reasons I'm giving 4 stars are two-fold:

The shrimp cocktail was overpriced - $18 for 5 shrimp? C'mon...yummy but lame.

And

The desert menu is seriously lacking - I was expecting to see at least one amazing thing and they were all boring: cake, apple fritter, cheesecake, gelato...boring!!

Other than that, everything was amazing. I'm getting over a cold and they brought me out my own tea kettle which sat next to the table and stayed hot for two hours. And the finishing salt they provided in a tiny bowl was a great touch!

Order a steak, it'll be cooked perfectly with a great crust on it. Have them bring all the sauces too; their bernaise is ridiculously fluffy - they infuse it with liquid nitrogen!!  And the beurre blanc is perfect and delicate.

YUM (PS, if you get Mercedes as your server, you're in for a treat! She's amazing!)",1
"Great BBQ - Friendly staff, super atmosphere and reasonable prices - what else can you ask for? 
Ribs and BBQ Chicken are my favorite.  Try the Devils spit sauce if you dare.",1
I had a mani/pedi and they did a wonderful job every time I visit.. The place is clean and the specialists are very nice..,1
"We visited for the annual Local First Fall Festival. There was no parking available, so we had to go across the street. There were also too many people, so crowding and navigation were problematic. There were a good number of tents offering free samples. It was great to try food from several local places, since we got to discover new places to visit later. Unfortunately, none were selling food, so we couldn't also get lunch on the spot and had to go elsewhere for a full meal. I like this event as a way to try food samples and explore potential places to visit in the future.",0
"This charming little cafe made my day-  the atmosphere is charming, clean, bright and warm....and the wait staff and cook were friendly and welcoming.... but the food?  the food was the best part.

eclectic, delicious AND reasonably priced.

I got an eggplant panini--called espaniclata or something- which came with a side salad.  The quesadilla I split with my coworker was surprising and sweet- good for a snack or dessert.  I wasn't a big fan of the chai (I stole a sip from a friend)---it was Indian, just not what I am used to- not as sweet
Anyways, I went on Friday for lunch, and liked it so much I had to go back Sunday.  Again, fantastic.  I think I found a new love.",1
"Okay,talk about coincidences....
The other day I was compli-chatting with fellow yelper Jarvis about hard to find music.
Today I run into a past acquaintence while out and about.
How do either of these tie into a review of Boom Boom La Rue's?
Okay,follow along if you will.
So I run into this past acquaintence who's apparently had a bit of a rough week.She tells me about finding this store in the middle of a bad day and it immediately turned her frown upside down.
She's raving about it.Then she tells me she has a yelp account and has added a review.
I tell her I too have some reviews on yelp.
Today I'm in that neck of the woods and so I stop in.
Holy hell!
This place is a drag queen's delight!
It's insanely glitterific and there are beaded dresses and sequined accessories everywhere.
Not anything I can personally do anything with,but I did manage to pick up a few things as gifts for friends.
And none of it broke the bank.
What does this have to do with my convo with Jarvis?
A day or so ago we were discussing hard to find music and I brought up Nina Hagen.
The sales girl in this store was a DEAD RINGER for Nina Hagen!!!!
Flame red spikey hair and clothes right out of 1978 pure punk rock!
That took me back to the good old days for sure.
She knew the stock,was able to make excellent suggestions by asking specific questions and wasn't the least bit pushy.
She was able to attend to  several customers at the same time and created a very social atmosphere for everyone there.
For someplace I didn't expect to feel comfortable in,it was a pleasant surprise.
While there wasn't anything there I would feel the need to buy for myself,I could see going back again and again to get gifts for friends.
A great experience.",1
"This is my first dinner stop anytime I'm in Scottsdale, and always makes me look good when I recommend it.

This time, the standouts were the ceviche, the crab queso, the lamb adobo, and the  Cadillac marg.  Tablemates had other dishes they raved about.

Noteworthy notes:

I've not yet sat on the patio, but I can't explain why.  It looks awesome.

The margaritas are sufficiently stiff.  They're not my preferred carburetor cleaning strength, but neither are they simply jazzed-up lemonade or those super-acidic-1.0 pH version you get some places.

The service was a little lax this time, less attentive than before, and that's the only reason I'm not giving LS a 5 this time.

If you're after Mexican when in Scottsdale, this is the first place to point your ride.",1
"This place ROCKS! It's a little loud, but it's worth the visit. 
Granted, I cannot pronounce half of the things on the menu, but the Jalapeno Cilantro hummus is to-die-for delish. 
The Greek salad is awesome, as are the gyros. 
I've never made it past the hummus, gyros and salad, but it is consistently great food and quick service. 
Always busy, but isn't every good restaurant? 
Go! It's yummy! This location is my favorite, as I think the one at Desert Ridge has slightly different tasting food (on the negative side of different tasting, that is).",1
"Steak, yes, but 2 other words first come to mind when reminiscing about Modern Steak: Retail Therapy.

No, I'm not talking about the fact that Modern Steak is conveniently (albeit awkwardly) located in Scottsdale's Fashion Square. Instead, I think back fondly on a delightful little cocktail -- Belvedere, Grand Marnier, strawberry, basil and lemon juice, served chilled in a martini glass (as expected), but also with a little carafe of extr drinky-drink (unexpected), complete with a suspended ice-ball to keep your drink cold while you sip -- without watering it down. GENIUS. 

Ok, ok, so you're wondering: why the 3 stars? Well, genius cocktails only get you so far. I like to think that I've sampled a fair number of steaks in my day, from frou-frou to straight-from-farm fresh, and I gotta say that the whole steak experience at Modern Steak was about a 3 -- not bad, but not amazing. Just pretty...average. And for $46, I'm not %100 convinced it was worth it. Let me elaborate:

 - 12 oz. filet: I ordered it three of their five sauces -- the Steak Sauce (which cost extra...bummer) and the House-Made Ketchup. Now, one of the sauces that I simply a-dore with a nice steak is a Peppercorn sauce...so I was a little bummed when they didn't have one. So after getting a recommendation for the Steak Sauce, I went with it, and it was...well, kind of a let down. I didn't love either sauce, truth be told. Granted, I haven't tried the other three, so I guess I'll have to go back and check them out, but all in all, my steak experience was lessened by these sauces, rather than heightened. Boo.

 - Sides: we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Yukon Gold Potato Puree. The sprouts were...meh, but I'm willing to admit that I've been spoiled by the best brussel sprouts of all time at a little place called Larchmont Grill in Los Feliz, CA. They are fantastic. But even so, I'm not convinced these were really that great...I felt they were a definite let down. As for the potatoes, they were literally SWIMMING in butter, which made them very difficult to eat...and to top it all off, both sides were pretty small, even for two people. 

All in all, I felt the level at which the meal was prepared was a bit sub-par considering the prices and what I can imagine they were going for...there are a lot of restaurants that do what they do, and do it a lot better, so if they want to compete, they're going to need to up their game. UP it. 

Combined with the fact that we were sitting awkwardly on the patio, which was really just sort of jutting out into the mall, I can't justify more than 3 stars. However, would I try it again? Absolutley. Get the steak? Maybe not. But I think that, for a relatively new restaurant, they're well on their way.",0
I agree with the other guys. The towels here are gross. Staff is not helpful. When i checked in there was no vehicles in parking lot. When I asked for a room I could park in front of because I wanted to be able to keep an eye on my truck they said none were available to me. If you don't get much business maybe you should be nice to the people who do show up.,0
"Fun little place to just explore and TRY so many different samplings.    The staff was great and super friendly!  The lemon cupcakes were AMAZING!!!  

Little tip:  buy a baguette to try all the great olive oils and tapenades",1
"There is a certain sense of nostalgia that exudes from Phoenix Muni that you don't really get at the newer Spring Training facilities in Arizona. True, it is the oldest still in use, but it feels more intimate and more geared towards the spirit of seeing your team before the season starts. It's less about business and more about getting back into the swing of the things, having a few laughs on the basepads and shaking hands with the people who really live and die by their fandom. 

Most of the seats beyond 1B and #b sides are benches, another throwback, but really, there isn't a bad seat to watch a game. Get there early if you're into meeting players and getting autographs and also be prepared to wait in lines for food or drink. Even when ALL the stands are open, they are not enough to service a packed house of hungry fans. 

Bring cash, only a few places accept card.",0
"Tonight was great. I had a calzone, pepperoni and olive,  Coppola Zinfandel, the wife had a pizza with nice and hot jalapenos. The staff was nice, so much that we made comments to each other about the quality.",1
Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.,1
"OK, not knowing what to expect when walking up to the RC when I saw a courtyard full of people mulling around, I thought a relaxed, quiet meal was shot to hell! Lucky for us, all the peeps walking around (seeming ""Zombie-like"") were waiting on Pizzeria Bianco, the Pizza place across the way!  OK Back to the review of RC.. I have to agree with Francis L.. Good sliders, fish was below average BUT the Wedge Fries are awesome!! The fish itself was OK, but the breading was watery as if steamed from the inside! I was totally bummed because It had a good flavor.. but was inedible! The 'Tartar' sauce was another huge hit! not a creamy sauce but liquidy with tons of Cucumber chunks... The Onion Rings are worth a try.. and they have a nice Horseradish- ranch sauce.
We sat inside, nice decor... you gotta like the English Pub look which is fine by me! We'll be back for sure!!
Nutshell- Nice Bar menu, good bar food- GREAT drinks!! Great people watching spots from front porch area... Defiantly worth repeat visits!",1
"I like Over Easy. The former location had more charm but this one is bigger and you don't have to wait as much :)
The food is great and the owners are wonderful and friendly. 
We just ate breakfast there. I got the 3 eggs over easy with mushrooms. The eggs were way too raw. I told the server about it and I asked to just get 2 eggs over easy instead of remaking the dish as the kid in the table was getting grumpy. That's what I ate for breakfast. The server didn't take it off the bill. I wouldn't say anything about it but I didn't get to eat the dish I wanted but still got to pay for it. Not cool.
The Ppllo Loco is great ! 
Hopefully this is a one time issue and the owners are still on top of everything like they used to be.",1
"No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley!

I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins, you can see i've frequented there since. 

I've tried a lot of other ""great"" burgers -- 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc - but IMHO, none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys. 

The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that I'm in the area to get one! I just feel that there's more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun, the taste, the way the cheese melts over the whole patty, the special sauce, and the burger itself. 

And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and "" He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows"". 

I've recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it! Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley. 

Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to.",1
"I had a great experience here and was suprised by how charming and clean the spa is inside, given it is right off of busy rural rd!  I had Lana as my manicurist and she gave a GREAT pedicure.  I used a coupon from the ASU Insider's book and got a relaxing, hour long and hot stone pedicure for $18.  I think the normal price is still around $18...maybe $20 for the cheapest one??!!  Lana was super friendly and sweet, and the owner was also very helpful and made me feel comfortable.  I will definitely go back here for a gel mani!!",1
I liked the concept. Staff was very nice. Food tasted like it was warmed up in a microwave and cold on top and warm on the bottom. After we watched our  movie we wanted to purchase tickets a week in advance for another movie. We went to customer service and asked them if they knew if TinTin would be playing on Weds. (we were there Saturday night). They told us they did not know and we would have to check on Weds. Whaaat? They don't know what movies are playing the following week? I was ticked off... their website is no better. It is confusing and hard to order tickets. I searched for tickets for tomorrow and it says showtimes not available. Sure seems like they don't want anybody to come see any movies. After spending $100 for food and movie I think I will try a different place.,0
I only go for the movies or when I know what I'm getting.  Not much of a shopper but I remember having fun here when I still lived in L.A. and came to visit.,1
"Very consistent, thin crust pizza, made with fresh ingredients and excellent cheese! The market place is lively and the atmosphere is festive!",1
"Not only does this place get it's ingredients directly from Italy, it makes a variety of flavors fresh, daily! 

I got my first taste of gelato when I visited Rome Italy a few years back. I've tried other gelato spots around the U.S, but nothing has caught my AMORE, or the authentic Italian flavor, more than Angel Sweet. 

So far my favorite combo is the ""most popular"" Panna Cotta with Banana, (which an employee recommended), Hazelnut and Pistachio, as well as SUPER Dark Chocolate again, with the Panna Cotta.

Don't forget your punch card, buy 12, and get one kid's size free!",1
"Blue 32 has a really great atmosphere and terrific menu.  The menu has everything from soup and salads to sandwiches to pasta.  There is a great beer selection, and happy hour/reverse happy hour in the bar.  They even serve a late night menu in the bar when many places are closed during the week. 
For late night last night we had nachos, spinach dip (soooo good), veggie platter and wings.  The beer was cold and the food was hot. 
The server was nice and the bathrooms were clean.",1
"The furniture was nice, but I didn't get a welcoming vibe in here at all. First of all, it smells like a dead cat in there -- perhaps it's the mid-century furniture, but whatever, light some incense or something. Second, the guy working there was completely cold. No hello, no how are you, no welcome. He just stared us down the entire time, not saying a word, making sure we didn't touch anything at all. It's a frickin' furniture store! How can you not be allowed to sit on the couches? I don't care if they're vintage or antiques or the like, it's not getting my business.",0
"There have to be some considerations made when attending Frank and Lupe's: First off, you have to understand that it's not GREAT Mexican food. That is to say, it's not real high quality, but more of what you would get at your buddies grandma's house. The second is that the service is somewhat spotty at times. You give your order to the ""waiter"", who then disappears as you are serviced throughout the nite by the ""bus boys"". Getting the check is the hardest thing there is. 

Having said all that, this place is TAST-TEE! I can't get enough of their enchilada's. If you're lucky enough to be there when they are doing their Poblano Chile enchiladas, get them! They are amazing. The chicken mole enchilada plate is also incredibly delicious. And sopapilla's??? WHERE THE HELL HAVE THESE THINGS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!?! Drizzle some honey on these bad boys and enjoy throughout the meal. 

Like I said, you have to understand what you're getting into with Frank and Lupe's and if you can look past a few of their shortcomings, the food, atmosphere, and prices here are some of the best in town!",1
"This was a nice casino experience.  It wasn't as loud as Las Vegas.  The food was really greasy and made me a bit sick.  Admittedly, I chose to eat at the fast food place inside the casino, but ah well.  I still had a great time.  I don't really gamble, so I only came out $10 ahead, but it was still fun.",1
"I dined here last week with my wife and in-laws and, I gotta say, it doesn't get much better.  Ambiance was dark but classy.  Loved the music (no dated Rat Pack stuff here).  Started the evening with their amazing Trio of Duck Fat Fries.  The truffle emulsion may have been the best sauce I've ever had in my life!  Only got better from there: Shellfish tower was loaded with goodies and all tasted straight from the ocean!  For entrees, my wife got the Trio of Kobe Beef and I had the Fried Chicken for two.  One of the top meals I've ever had in my life.  The chicken was so moist an came with a truffle mac & cheese and onion jus.  I did say it was for two but it was so good that i refused to share.  My wife couldn't stop talking about the Kobe Trio.  

But, I gotta say, the best part of the experience was the staff.  Knowledgeable just isn't enough to describe the service here.  They care about every single detail, never missing one.  The Sommelier made excellent wine recommendations (and each one well within my price range) and never skipped a beat when it came to pouring for the table.  The server was as professional as professional gets and the Manager seemed to always be there to pull out a chair or provide a fresh napkin.  Flawless.

Well done Bourbon Steak!",1
Angel sweet is without a doubt the best gelato I've had outside of Italy.,1
"Things I liked: The homemade chips (mmm), the red salsa, the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service.

Things that just didn't work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well. Perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine, but I was not impressed.",0
"Clean, organized, and well-stocked (for the most part), Fujiya's carries my favorite car freshener, chips, bread, and iced coffee (in a can) among many other good things. Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service, I am always happy to shop there. The bentos, I wish, are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo, CA, but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento, so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping. What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and they'll have it available and ready. I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry. It's no wonder I've been coming here year after year.",1

WHY:  Because you deserve to get out and enjoy a movie... bonus that it's a movie with Early-Bird prices of $5.75!

I wanna give a shout-out to the management, staff and... whoever thought of parent movie mornings to begin with.  It was nice to get out of the house with my lil one, to do something that I used to take for granted when I wasn't a parent. haha  And then to get there and have the theater so nicely set-up, complete with changing tables and dim lights... well that was amazing.  All of the care-givers there were relaxed, happy and able to enjoy a movie without worrying about missing a part if their lil one fussed.  We all had nothing but praises for your kid-friendly attitude and made plans to meet often.  

Thank-you Ultra Star Cinema for a new, great experience.  It's been a while since a place surprised me so much (in a good way)!  

See ya there!",1
I'm usually not a fan of indoor tanning but post baby I felt like I needed a little pick me up color. I chose this place because of their good prices- 3 tans in a lay down bed for 17 dollars. The staff is so amazing and friendly and I got a nice brown tint after a couple of sessions.,1
"Aaron Has Been My Tattoo Artist for a long time and the quality of Aaron and all the artists in this shop are amazing very clean,sterile and safe. 

Be Back soon need some work done",1
"It was so hot on the day I went to this place, they were baking the pizzas on the roof! hehe!  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pizza, pretty damm good. I have 2 slices and one of Sicilian; all were just like NYC. The service was good too, unlike in NYC. :)",1
"I've been going here for 10 years. My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe. I needed everything quickly and was very specific. She got everything done in time for my trip. 

Over the years I've brought dozens of clothes. She's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress. She's hemmed and taken in. She's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look. I can communicate anything I want and she'll have it done exactly the way I envisioned it. We've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks. 

Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality. Every single person I've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work.",1
"I love Gabriel. He does an amazing job every single time I'm there. I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in, and a cut and style, and always leaving looking great. His attitude is always upbeat, it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood. The salon is always clean and comfortable. I never feel like I'm being forced into spending more money or buying product, but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions. I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him. My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides.",1
"I used to come here about once a week for their amazing vegetarian sandwiches. My favorite is the griefo with pepper jack cheese, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, and tomatoes. The hemp cream cheese is to DIE for seriously! I also enjoy the humbolt, which is very similar, and the majic mushroom with sliced portabella mushrooms, teriyaki glaze, green bell peppers, pineapple and pepper jack cheese. The 8inch is soo big but makes a great and filling lunch. You can't beat the prices either. Get the garlic herb bread, it is the best. The only thing I do not like about this place is that the whole ""marijuana"" theme can get old and annoying. This location can also get really really busy and the sandwiches take time to make. Staff is usually pretty friendly and social though. One last thing is that if you eat there or have to wait for a while your clothes will smell like food :/",1
"The banana pecan french toast was great - order a 1/2 order and split it with someone else for ""breakfast desert""!

Rest of the food was definitely better than ok, but dropped my review to 3 stars because restrooms weren't clean and had no hand soap -- where are employees washing their hands???",0
35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.,0
"I've been fortunate enough to stay at several Ritz-Carlton hotels around the US... San Francisco, Amelia Island, Atlanta, Buckhead, and Lake Oconee are the ones that stand out.  I've also been to events at many of these locations and more and I've always been blown away by how beautiful these hotels are and how incredible the service has been.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the Ritz sets a standard for other hotels, and they are known for luxury!

When I recently spent the night at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I was not as blown away... the room was just ok - nothing so special, and I don't have any major complaints but I guess with my past experience and the reputation of the Ritz in general, I expected more.  (Don't hate me, Ritz-Carlton; I'm still a fan, but maybe not so much of the Phoenix location compared to the rest).

I will say that we did get a discounted room rate because I was being honored as one of AZ's Finest and that's where the black-tie gala took place... and it was quite the event as well - we had a blast!  

I took advantage of the fitness room for a quick workout after we checked in, and it was one of the nicer hotel fitness rooms I've seen in awhile.  Unfortunately, the pool was closed for renovation during our stay, so my BF could not swim on site, but luckily they shuttled him over to the Biltmore to swim instead.

So, overall, it was a pleasant experience - I just can't bring myself to give 5 stars like I would at any of the other Ritz-Carltons I've been to... but stay tuned for my review of the Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch (which is where I'll be heading in December for a wedding) - that one looks like it may be the best one I've seen yet!",1
"Yeah it kind of sux! Burgers aint that great (Though not terrible), girls aint that hot (At all :( ), place aint very exciting (or clean).

Yeah it is kind of cool that they are dressed as nurses and you get a little hospital bracelet with their name and such. However, putting on mandatory hospital gown is odd and kind of off putting (To me anyhow). They also do have a bar and sell unfiltered stogies of some kind. 

They also do not take CC!!! WTF I say! Is is a bit too much ""Old times charm"" for my taste. There is an ATM right in there so there is no real need to bring cash with you. 

I do not know, whole thing kind of odd. It would fit my better in like Greer or Page or something, rather then in Chandler.",0
"We keep coming back! I love this place. The food is always so good and even when I ask the kitchen for the naked cheeseburger, they make it pretty. And its delish and I love me a cheeseburger. This last time I ordered a vodka tonic and asked the bartender to surprise me - either Belvedere or Ketel. Back came the most frosty delicious Belvedere vodka tonic. Perf. The lovely, as prefers, mans up to the filet. And is always happy, sipping his pinot alongside.. 

I just wanted to say, yum. And we'll keep coming back. Thanks PCG.",1
"when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.

well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. 

it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...

our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'

then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.

i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. 

we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had. 

as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing. 

awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in. 

if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it.",0
"We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic!
We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating! They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING. 
Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get.
Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!",1
"This place is so cool
i was startled to find that Tempe has something like this
It reminded me of the C.A.T. in Eugene.
There are soo many bike parts, and tools, frames of all kinds
from what i've learned is that you can pay a small sum and build your own bicycle here, or offer to volunteer and have your bike for free by working off the debt
i came here a while back to see if they had anything of interest, and wouldnt you know it that on my way a nut and bolt fell off of my stirrup so i thought perfect, now i can get another
the dude running the operation didnt charge me a thing
so i left like a $1 in the tip jar
it's such a priveledge to have something like this for the community, i just hope enough ppl reinvest their time into it so it can exist for generations of cyclists to come.",1
"Good food, if all the Taiwanese comes here that means this is really good.",1
"Okay, you might be asking yourself ""who reviews a Taco Bell? or even looks up reviews for Taco Bell?"" Well, I would ask myself that if I were you, but here we are.

This Taco Bell is awesome. They have really nice and friendly people working for them, and my husband and I would eat inside because we liked the service. We lived a block away, and came every so often over 3.5 years and it was always the same. We appreciate that kind of good service, and it's not one you would expect to get from a fast-food chain.",1
"I am only reviewing this location as the other locations are hit and miss. The one on Tatum and Dynamite was bad both times we went there. So, I go out of my way for this Barro's Pizza. The decor is similar to all locations. Very drab and not very comfortable. But, we are talking about a pizza joint, so they will get a pass on the decor. 

I had a mini Hawaiian pizza on my last trip and was delicious! The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce was tasty and the perfect amount. I ate every bit of it with no crust leftovers. That was how outstanding it was. 

I am surprised that the consistency between locations is such a wild swing from outstanding to mediocre at best. The owner should look into that.",1
"This place is all about the seafood.  Don't roll up to the Fish Market expecting a cool place to hang or a hip crowd.  No problem on the crowd...lots of folks in a pretty basic seafood restaurant, chowing on the best seafood I've had in the valley so far.  The hip is not here.  Not until I showed up with my wife Audrey W to meet Kevin H and Marian H.  You could actually see the coolness spread around the restaurant when we walked in...a subtle ripple, sort of like a gentle wave at a spring training game.

So I arrived in Phoenix from Boston and have high standards for seafood.  I had been craving fish & chips for awhile and decided to give Fish Market a try.  I got a combo-fish, scallops and prawns.  The batter was light and not very oily...+1.  The prawns were very tender and done to perfection..+1.  The scallops were tender, sweet and juicy...+1.  The fish was done just right as well although it was not the haddock or even cod I am accustomed to in Boston.

Everyone else was pleased with their food as well.  I will be trying other seafood places in the valley but I'll keep Fish Market in mind as a standby.",1
"The only plus to this place was that the bartenders are on their game, otherwise leave it for the Jersey Shore wannabes and slooters that get turned on by extra extra medium Tap Out t-shirts.",0
"Great BBQ, although not a huge fan of the cafeteria style ordering. I have been twice, I got the brisket sandwich one time and ribs the next. Both were delicious. I added  bbq sauce to the ribs because I thought they needed it. Try the homemade root beer at least once, too. YUM. We got there just in time ( a bit before 6 on a Friday night)  as we were leaving the line was 3x as long...out the door and around the corner.  Oh FYI...for sides I got the beans (loved them) and my kids said the macaroni and cheese was good. Dad wasn't impressed with the coleslaw.",1
"Since moving to Arizona I have selected Fry's as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice! I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip.

I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students.

Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable.",1
"Are you kidding me, this place is great.  Perfectly sized bread, quality ingredients, cool staff.  When I think dream sub, I think italian night club no mayo, and extra peppers.  Don't get no betta!",1
Worth the drive and more!!  This absolute gem in the west valley is exactly what we need to have and support.  a family owned business that is TOP NOTCH!!  The food was exquisite and the service responsive and attentive.  I am a HUGE fan.,1
"Was extremely psyched to try Lobby's, considering all of the great reviews, but I was sadly disappointed with the results. I'm a freak for Chili burgers (good ones are very difficult to find) and The Lobby's Chili burger was fairly dull, featured Cinci style Chili (BLAH) and like. some sort of cheese whiz kinda crap.  Boo. Also ordered fries, and a Chicago dog.. the Chicago dog was overpriced and forgettable, and the crinkle cut fries were reminiscent of Del Taco's.. which isn't exactly a bad thing, but considering that Lobby's is supposed to be a tasty, quality burger place, frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach.. ALSO the amount of salt on the fries was enough to invoke a stroke! :x  Finally whoever dude was that handed me my bag of food was all like ZIPPY DOO I GAVE YOU A CUP OF FRENCH FRY SAUCE.. There were two orders of fries.. one cup of sauce.. which was just basic secret sauce.. not super great... secret sauce, to boot.. Thanks bro, but I don't need any secret sauce favors.",0
I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!,1
"Coming from NY, I tried out the bubble tea to see how it compares to back home with kung fu tea and quicklys in flushing.

its actually pretty good, but with one downside.
i got the taro milk tea, and my friend got the honey milk tea.

the taro milk tea is very popular in flushing, so I decided to try it out to see how it compares.. and it wasn't that great.
I don't know if it's how the drink is supposed to be served, or if its because the maker of my drink added too much powder. but my drink was really bad.

but my friends drink was outstanding, probably the best milk tea i've ever had.",1
"The view from the top is quite amazing! I took my fiancee up here for a sunrise as part of her proposal, and she loved it!! You really can see the whole valley. As you're driving around Phoenix and have an unobstructed view to the south, you should be able to see all of the radio antennas at the top. You'd be surprised how high you are when you finally up get there. The rangers up there are friendly too. Just as some of the other reviews state though, do WATCH OUT for random bike riders, runners, and various pedestrians on your way up and in. The roads are a little narrow and there is not much room for error.",1
"dr. matsumoto and her team are the best!  she came recommended to me by a friend who also goes there.  they truly care about the WHOLE child and not just their medical care.  we have seen 3 of the pediatricians in the office and they have all been great.  we developed a special bond with Dr. Miller during a very lengthy health issue with my son.  it's a 45 minute drive for us now that we've moved, but we still make the drive  to see dr.  miller because we  trust her to make the right decisions and offer the best advice for my child's health.",1
"I had been dying to try True Food Kitchen for a while now, after seeing reviews on it on various people's ""Vegetarian"" lists. I was even more psyched to see that it not only is close to where I live, but also took the place of that awful Coffee Plantation spot in the Biltmore! Yay!

I went with my somewhat reluctant meat-eating boyfriend, but he was quickly won over with their expansive alcohol menu and their plethora of meat dishes- all either local or organic. A place we can both agree on!

I ordered the honey lemonade ($3) which was the perfect balance between tart and sweet-- honey is a great sweetener! I was brought a refill just when my glass became less than half full-- bonus!

We also ordered the hummus appetizer (~$8), which we both enjoyed immensely. My boyfriend liked the tart olives and feta cheese, whereas I loved the cucumbers! There was more hummus left over as our pita bread slices dwindled, but that just means we loaded up our pieces!

For my main course, I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) ($9), which I really enjoyed. The tempeh was pretty crunchy, but it was balanced by the smooth avocado slices. The boyfriend ordered the Organic Ravioli with Ricotta cheese and kale pesto (~$13), which was super good! It came with 6 pieces of ravioli, which he thought was not enough at first, but after he cleaned his plate he said he was ""stuffed."" Good sign!! The plate also comes with a ton of meaty mushrooms, which made it even better in my opinion. 

We definitely did not have room for dessert, but I've heard mixed reviews of the desserts so I'm not sure if that's something we'll end up trying. Our server was extremely attentive to us, did not pressure us into ordering anything extra, and was prompt in refilling water glasses, answering questions, and bringing the check.

The atmosphere is interesting- a mix of well-dressed business and retired people (think: khaki pants, button up shirts, sweater vests (in the winter); nurses just off work; people coming in for happy hour (jeans and nice shirts); and people just in off the street (shorts, casual shirts, even hats). I really liked this ambiance, because it doesn't make it too stuffy and turn people ""off"" of this locally grown, organic restaurant concept.

We would definitely be back in a heartbeat, but the only reason I marked it down was because we were sitting underneath their funky lights, and a spider fell out of the light on to my boyfriend's arm. He wasn't terribly bothered by it (other than 'wtf, why is there a spider on my arm?') but I would have freaked out. So... don't sit under the lights, if you can help it!",1
"I just started taking my car here a few months ago. Someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60,000 mile check up, and that's how they got my business.

I brought my car there for a routine oil change, and they did the 60,000 mile check up which was very useful. Of course there was the usual list of things I should fix, but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me, which I can't say for most mechanics.

The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work, so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how I'm going to get back to the shop.

Bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and I definitely trust them with my car needs.",1
"I am excited about this place, even though I have not had many opps to try northern style Chinese food.  Think dough, and don't mistakenly believe it's the same dough steam/cooked/fried/stuffed in different ways.  
The kind owner lady proudly told me each of our 3 dishes was made w/ a unique dough recipe... 

At first I was worried all the dough would overpower my tastebuds, until I asked for some dipping sauce... they kindly made me a black vinegar, ginger, and scallion sauce... that just upleveled everything.  Who knows if it's traditional or not, but I implored the owner to start dishing this out when Americans like me (smiley face) come over and eat.

The off-menu items are written on a small whiteboard sitting atop the freezer stuffed w/ to-go dumplings... luckily the folks there speak English, so I'll be working my way thru this secret menu and who knows.. this might go 5 stars!

SW corner of Ray and Alma School, next to the JCC.",1
"I prefer going to this location of Macayo's over the others because of the ambience. It's way different than the others and it doesn't ""feel"" like the other Macayo's. This one is much more festive. It has a ton of patio seating and lots of shade. The antique train outside makes it much more interesting. The parking lot, however, is right next to the light rail tracks and it's small, so parking is a little dicey. They sacrificed parking for patio seating. The prices are extremely affordable. Their food is very good. Service is always consistent. Cheap margaritas. I've never been here on a weekend. I always stop in on a weekday around noon and then it has some business people on lunch.",1
"WOW what can I say... our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlie's for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training.  

We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut.... WONDERFUL!!!!! My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite... the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant.

Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az.",1
"Sorely disappointed.  

I used to be a fan, but this barely half-full(at high noon on a Monday!) restaurant just doesn't cut it anymore. 

Wait staff was sub-par, food was average, and the prices still conveyed the idea that the management thought they were awesome.

Parking is a royal pain in the butt -- and has clearly had an effect on other nearby businesses.  (This part is no fault of Uno's as far as I know).

If given a choice for a tasty business lunch, look elsewhere.",0
"Pretty damn expensive, but I don't think I could ever get sick of the teppenyaki!",1
"I wish I could love this place... It's just tough. 
I've eaten here several times and just haven't really LOVED anything. My sandwiches have always been dry and kind of bland tasting. Salads have been ok, but I usually feel like I can make them better. Hummus - dry. Dolmades - tasted like the ones from the jar. Ahh, so sad, because it's food that I do normally love. 
Here is why I gave this a three- happy hour prices are good ($2 or $3 for small plates). With prices like that, I can forgive some of the food quality a bit.",0
"Needed to get some keys made, so I dropped by here.  The key machine is located at the front of the store at the customer service/returns desk.  I popped in and they made my keys within minutes.  The girl working the machine was really efficient and got me out of there fast......which is great because I hate waiting.

Will have to drop by here for other home stuff another time.

"Arrived at 4:30 and staked out our place in line for the 5pm opening.  There were quite a few people ahead of us so it was clear we would be in the second round of people.  Placed our name on the list and went next door for wine and apps.  The goat cheese crostini was excellent.  The wait staff was pleasant and kept us updated on the wait.  After an hour fifteen we were seat. Waiter was extremely pleasant.

We started with the antipasto (wood roasted vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese) and then ordered 4 pizzas

Margherita - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil topped with cremini mushrooms, 
ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios
WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage and salami
BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula and added Prosciutto di Parma (favorite)

Service was great and the pizza well worth the wait",1
"I recently went to The Breakfast Club for the first time with a good friend who I hadn't seen in awhile. It was a weekday and so, while it was still busy, we didn't have to wait to be seated. The food was good, but slightly over-priced. My biggest problem with the restaurant - the service. They were slow to deliver our drinks and food, yet once our food came, they were swarming around like bees every five minutes to take our plates so we could get out of there. I felt like they didn't care at all for the fact that I was having a nice morning with a good friend but instead wanted us to pay and leave. After we had been there for just over an hour and fifteen minutes, out waitress actually told us to leave the table and finish our conversation outside so they could seat other customers. We were mortified. I have NEVER been asked to leave a restaurant in my life. Needless to say, they didn't win a loyal customer with me.",0
"I have stopped into Copper Star on previous occasions, during street festivals, but today was the first time I came to sit and study. Man, am I a fan of this place. I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options (Lux, Lola, Hob Nobs, SBUX, etc) but I have to say I really liked the vibe here. The music wasn't loud, the people relatively quiet and chill, and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me. I liked that while on a busy street (7th Ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on. That added to the peace and quiet of it. Employees were nice, free wi-fi (internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop), and I enjoyed my small, mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie (both just under $7). I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie (which was soooo good if I might say). They are open until 9pm on Sundays which is pretty cool. I have yet to use their drive through for coffee, but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX. There is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off....you can give your dog a bath at Wag-n-Wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee.",1
"This is the place the Scottsdale pooches come to smell and be smelled.

Sure, you've got your requisite handbag dogs and the larger breeds but they've kept them separated by the ever PC ""active dogs"" and ""passive dogs"". Nice. 

The beasties go on the active side since they are not about to jump in a Louis Vuitton carrier anytime soon. The ""active"" area was nicely maintained with good landscaping, plenty of poo bags, and a water fountain. My little prisses don't use water fountains though so I must pack their own bottled water. 

My only complaint is that it seems very crowded and it's not nearly as big as Grovers Basin near my house. But, the beasts were tired and happy on the way home so no complaints.",1
"By far my favorite restaurant in valley. Deliciously spicey. A bit pricey if you're picking and choosing items but they're complete meals are a pretty good bang for the buck. 

Not actually sure about the service as I've only gotten takeout but if its any where close to the quality of food, then it must be awesome.",1
"I am a fan of big and tasty sandwiches but have had very few really good ones as of late. That is until I tried this place. I was in the area and decided to give the them a try after spotting their sign. When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty (normally a bad sign) but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big. This was my first time eating here so I took a few minutes to see what they had to offer. The sandwiches here come in different sizes from a small 5 inch to a 2 foot extra long, which makes it easy to decide what to order depending how hungry you are.

The 8 inch sub is easily enough for one really hungry person or two not so hungry people. Seriously it is about the size of a subway foot long and taste way better to! You have three choices when it comes to bread. They are white, wheat, and sourdough. I chose sourdough for my sandwich and it was chewy and seemed to be really fresh. Like most sub shops they also have a selection of pre selected combos (18 to be exact) with toppings like Ham, Turkey, Pastrami, Salami, Capicolla, Roast Beef, and Tuna. The cheese selection includes Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American

What makes this place so different from most sandwich joints is the fact that they hand slice your meat when you order it. No more slimy meat that has been sitting in a case for hours and floating in weird juices Yuck! Finally a place that understands that it is OK to take the time to slice meat for each customer because it makes for a better tasting sandwich. One that a customer will want to come back for over and over again

For me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place. It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me (read my other reviews) but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich. The only thing that brought their score down was the fact that they had no customer parking and I had to pay to park in the garage. Yes I understand it is Tempe but why not at least offer to validate my parking LOL.",1
"Not a bad visit. I regularly visit the Location in Columbus, OH. I have developed a certain expectation as to the type of service that should be implemented in this concept. Compared to Hooters, this place will eventually put Hooters out of business. The food is consistent and delicious. I am a huge fan of the shepherds pie  and Quinlans 5 cheese pizza. The service at this particular Location was a few notches below the service provided at the Scottsdale and Columbus Locations. The servers seemed under trained in how to communicate with the guests. That preferred to fraternize amongst themselves which was the only fault that was noticed. The place was clean, restrooms well maintained, and the food was expeditiously served. Prices are a little high but who are we kidding, commodities are up everywhere. I will always stop by when passing this concept. Compared to it's competition of sports bars it is among the top of the list.",1
This place is closed.  Good riddance.,0
"Yikes.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because I think their Baja chicken burrito is super tasty &  their Mango Salsa.

Cons:
The place is dirty (dont take my word, read the other reviews)
The employees are always bullshitting until they rudely ask you what you want to order.
The employees never offer suggestions, which may be an English Language barrier.
The front door handle was broken my last time I went in here. Unreal.
The burritos are likley to squirt and get extremely messy on the last few bites....sick.  Dont eat in the car unless you have a blanket in your lap, gross. 

If Im craving a burrito, I will likely just go to the Chipotle across the street and wait in line for 15 mins VS this place....I think the only way Ill come back to this location is strait up steal their salsa and limes from their salsa bar.

This place would be better if they got friendlier harder working employees that actually cleaned the place up a bit.",0
"I'm not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other.  I felt it was necessary in this case.  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.  They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.  WOW!  This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.  It's refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.  He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.  Amazing.  Only in downtown do you meet people like that.  This is a great Subway.  Go here and skip the others.",1
"Though perhaps not the place you may pick for a special brunch with champagne and chocolate brioche French toast (a signature breakfast at the Sofitel Philadelphia), the Good Egg is my choice for neighborhood breakfast that offers consistent service and food in a comfortable atmosphere.

No matter how busy the restaurant becomes, and on Sunday it is packed,  the staff is always friendly and welcoming. You may have to wait for a table but the waits are never excessive and there is the coffee trolley where you can help yourself while waiting.  Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest (read Mothers/ Fathers days), service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down.  Someone here knows how to run a restaurant!

The menu contains a large assortment of the usual breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc, all well prepared and tasty.  In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters, and non-starch substitutes (cottage cheese, fruit, and tomatoes. etc).  Some of my favorites include the Hey Ricky Omelet, Huevos Ranchero ,or my indulgence a (as in one huge singular)  buckwheat pancake with (my choice of ""fillings): chocolate chips ( I admit my addictions), pecans, and bananas... 

We always opt for the patio and even in the scorching summer heat; the misters make this a great outdoor picnic with the best people watching in Phoenix.

After you have been here a few times you feel like part of the family and with their frequent dinner program they offer even more incentive to return.",1
"Let's start with an SAT-type question:

Scottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum.

a) Oakland A's
b) Rickey Henderson
c) Phoenix Municipal Stadium
d) Yankee Stadium

If you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And you're pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back.

Much like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni won't amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak.

We always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I don't care how bad the economy is, it's a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.  

There are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If you're not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If you're lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats.

The people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows.

Parking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  It's important to know, though, that the walk from the lot ""across the street"" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans.

So, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars.",0
"Theatre is very nice. Seats are not as comfortable as you would think. They have like office chairs in every other row. Also the food is not good, and it's so overpriced. Did you know it costs a dollar to put onions on your burger? Want cheese? That's another dollar. And it's not even good. Screen is beautiful and a clean picture though.. 3D was great.",0
"I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasn't so nice, it would get only 2 stars.",0
"Very small, but wonderful food and wine. Some of the staff mentioned that they worked previously at Bomberos Cafe & Wine Bar (now Timo's Wine Bar).

The concept of this place is killer.",1
"Chicago style hot dog?!  Sign me up!  I just moved here from Chicago, and I've been dreaming of Portillo's since I left.  Where am I going to find something even close to that in AZ?!  I was hoping this would be it.  The hot dog wasn't that bad.  The fries on the other hand, weren't so good.  My husband ordered a beef with hot peppers (giardiniera), and they were far from hot...almost tasted pickled.  And the sandwich?  TINY!!!  It was like a 4"" beef sandwich!  I didn't taste it, but he said that it just tasted like a roast beef sammy...not the Chicago beef that we are used to.  One of these days we'll find a decent ""Chicago-style"" restaurant out here in AZ.",0
"Perfect hotel for my conference travel needs.  Clean, new, great bars, close to other food options across the street, super friendly staff.  Great business traveler property.  The bed was SOOO comfortable.  Sometimes, Starwood beds can be too soft, but this was just right.  

Access to the convention center is so convenient.  Just out the door and down a block and a half.  Can't beat that in the heat!",1
"Honestly, I can't remember how I found out about Butter & Me, but I'm glad it happened.

My fiancee (now wife!) and I are addicted to cupcakes and we decided to swap the traditional wedding cake for some delicious cupcakes. Kelly at Butter & Me did not disappoint. She was absolutely fantastic to work with and has *the best* cupcakes in the valley! Believe me, we taste-tested a number of other vendors and everyone else's cupcakes tasted like small, dry, cakes.

The cupcakes from Butter & Me were exactly what we were looking for. They were perfectly moist, beautifully decorated, and there are a ton of delicious flavors to choose from!!!

I cannot recommend Butter & Me highly enough! The Yelp review sums it up: ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""",1
"Awesome carne asada, veggie taco and just about everything else.  Delicious and very easy on my wallet.",1
"Went here last night with another couple for dinner.  The pitcher of margaritas was spot on, the chips were outstanding along with the guacamole and salsa.  I ordered the tortilla soup which I ended up sending back cuz to be honest it tasted and looked like a bowl of enchilada sauce.  My husband ordered the filet and enchilada which I have to say was cooked perfectly and definitely would order if I ever went back.  The other couple ordered the beef short ribs which I didn't taste but they both agreed it was over cooked. Service was great but when I have to send something back which I rarely do I can't give more then 3 stars.",0
"Ugh.
I used to like this place.
But I've gotten over it.

I find the food to be uninspired, and below average.

Blah.",0
"I have been looking for a great therapist for a long time.  Someone that takes the time to read my body, to see the synergy of the muscles and be able to do the work.  Finally, I found Robert.  

He has been an LMT for more than 15 years in the Valley and continues to educated himself often.  His studio is located conveniently just off of the 51 about 10 minutes in a quiet residential neighborhood.

The massage intake questioning was thorough, but not invasive.  His set up is calming and the room & table were warmed by a heater!  The massage lasted 90 minutes or so, I didn't want to go back to the real world.  

He does offer Gift Certificates and has Pay Pal set up on his website if you didn't plan ahead with stopping for cash.  

I will definitely visit him again when I need the work!",1
"For a boba drink fan like me, it is still rare to find a tea place that has authentic tea (and not just milk powder), hot or cold tea choices, and boba and tea that taste great individually or separately.

I ordered an iced chocolate chai (yum! such a difference from plain old Oregon Chai used at most coffee houses) with boba.  The only negative is that the drink was $4.91, but it was well worth it!  Mmmmmmm love this place!",1
"Chloe's Corner, opened last week in the CityScape, Downtown.

The interior is modern, spacious and very comfortable. The design is not only admirable, but also very broad. Inside the restaurant there are various types of seating. Tables, counters even plush chairs to chill and kick it with a glass of beer or wine among friends. There is an outside patio too.

The first thing you notice during breakfast is a fifty cent cup of coffee. This is a bold brew in a paper cup and plastic top. Excellent coffee. For my morning meal I order Chloe's favorite, a six dollar 2 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon, toast, wedge of fruit, plate. The swirled marbled rye bread crafted at John Anthoney's Italian Bread Company was perfect. Potatoes sauteed with fresh chili peppers were tip top. Bacon was thick and so good.

This is one of the areas newest restaurants, and even has a few groceries. Fresh ready to go pre-made lunches, fruit, wine, beer and soft drinks. I would love to recommend at least one bottle water that would come in a paper carton instead of plastic. I took home a bottle of Le Village, Sparkling French Limonade, tasty.

Also a big thanks to Malalay, a super svelte, very friendly gal that not only poured the coffee and brought the food, but laughed with me too. And ^5's to my cook.

Total bill today was $10.33. I will visit again. Happy Hour next time, to check out the beer garden.",1
"From the moment you enter this place you get the feeling that you are entering some swanky underground restaurant, the lighting is dark and the decor is mysterious!!  I am in love with the fashionable staff who come to work wearing what they want as well as the chef in the back with the 12 inch mohawk. The drink menu is stocked with exciting choices such as ""In Between the Sheets"" and the ""Dirty School Girl""! Not your average bar! The BEST thing on the menu in my opinion is the House Made Fettuccine. Honestly the best homemade meat sauce ever and I am hard to please considering I was raised on Bolognese sauce! A great place to take a date whether it be your first or 100th this place will never disappoint.",1
"Pretty clean dining room and clean men's room,   friendly service,   as good as any quick serve restaurant.",1

"I love this place!!! OK. where do I start.. Great place to stop in for a quick lunch. AMAZING outside grill, everything is good. Best cheeseburger I've ever had. I don't even like Salmon and theirs is good. Good salad bar and salads ( pasta, tuna etc..) The pizza and sushi.. again amazing!! And........ they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from. Also, they have a great breakfast. Omelet station and all. I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos. GREAT outside patio",1
"TJ was there for me when my water heater broke and started flooding my garage.  He walked me through fixing it over the phone until he was able to send some help to my house.  Very grateful, and I will continue referring!",1
"I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.  

Portions are reasonable, not huge (I'm a big feller), and I was satified every time I ate there.  

Very pleasant environment, clean, spacious and calm.",1
Beer Selection 10/10 however service is 1/10. Staff lacks product knowledge. Specials are not mentioned. Wait time is long. Staff makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.,0
"Couple things.  First, I am reviewing a Delivery order that I placed.  (If you didn't know that they delivered... Now you do!)

You start by looking at their website, which is modest.  It's a black background with White text.  Pretty much all of their food is available for take-out, except for the alcohol.

*TIP* Make sure to look at their PDF Menu.  It has TONS of more choices than what is listed on their Website.  I wasn't even aware of this fact until I had ordered my food.

At this point, they do not have online ordering set up, so you call and place your order that way.

Cornish Pasty's (pronounced Pastie, not Pastey) are amazingly delicious.  They take whatever filling you choose (from the Chicken Alfredo to the Bangers and Mash), and they place it in a thin, crisp dough that surrounds it.  Think of a Calzone, except the Irish version.

Now, these are very, very filling.  They are modestly priced (all of them are less than $10), and they are EXTREMELY DELICIOUS.

Make sure you give them a try.  I will sure be eating here again!",1
"Good place to meet a group, watch a game or grab a quick bite. We found this place on St. Patrick's Day after a long, frustrating day of apartment searching. No wait, quick/good/friendly service, good food and lots of good beer. I like the segmented areas and because it is so big, even when there is a huge crowd, you never feel like you have lost your personal space. Have walked over many times since and will definitely continue to.",1
"Went here for brunch this morning (Sunday) and there were a few things that diminished the experience for me:
* You claim New Mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any New Mexican restaurant meal.
* At $3, the coffee is  a rip off! Seriously? We're not talking cappuccino, people and you're selling build-your-own Bloody Marys for the same price!
* The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy.

That said:
* The green salsa was really good.
* I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.)
* There are several options for $5; and, if they are all like the eggs benedict, they are generous portions.
* The patio is nice and the bar area feels like a neighborhood pub (not a cave, but that's not got to be a bad thing!)",0
"Dilemma: where the heck to find a nice place to eat near AZ Fairgrounds/Grand? (Shiverrrrrrrrrrrrr)

Promblem solved!  Found the answer @ Fez!

Candace was super speedy, always had a smile, and returned to our table about a dzn times in the 90 mins we were here.

Gazpacheo & Grilled Crustini was OMG good!  (problem was it only came with 3 tiny pieces of bread, had to ask for more, got few pieces of pita, still had 1/2 left bowl of gazpacheo, asked for more bread - cuz like what the heck are you going to do with a bowl of dip otherwise? and they charged us for the extra bread?  x 2 ?  not cool).

Cheese & Garlic Fondue was pretty good.  So was the Chicken Strips.

Really good drink specials (unfortunately, had none as their specialties are mostly tequila based - not for me!  nor am I a beer drinker, and I did not like their house wine).  But I did have a nice bottle of Sav. Blanc from New Zealand.

Anyhow, this fit the bill at having fabby Nom~Noms before heading over to the Coliseum (~ick~) at the Fairgrounds to see the Roller Derby Girls - Whoop~ Whoop!",1
"Every time I come here the staff is so rude! Its the closest bar to my gate so I'm kinda stuck. Hey staff, can you please pretend to like people????",0
"I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since I'm very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight. 


This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again.",1
"Kabuki was great....A lovely little middle-of-the-afternoon oasis found in Tempe Marketplace!  I scoped out the menu had some some sushi for happy hour, including some rare beef sashimi, some unusual and unique rolls and complimentary edamame.  Although I did not dine here for a full meal, I feel justified in expressing my enjoyment of their happy hour.  The tiny bar was cozy and the service was good.  The happy hour prices were enticing and I would definitely return for it:)  Although for my personal taste the ambiance of Kabuki seemed a little too corporate for me I definitely would return for their happy hour and maybe to sample other menu items.  I will keep you posted on my next visit:)",0
"This place has the best wraps I've ever had.  The smoothie's are good as well, but I go here because of the wraps.",1
"Being English and missing a lot of the things we can't get over here we were delighted to have found this place.  I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home, i.e, cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good!!  I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering $80 worth without any regrets.  Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before, so looking forward to trying those.  Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I don't it would matter what it's like inside.  Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe.",1
"One of the best local places to get your booze!

BevMo has nothing on the charm, history, and liquor selection of a place like this! I am not into most beers or wines (of which they have plenty), rather I like to sample the odd/exotic Vodkas, Rums, and Tequillas.

Sportmans is a good value, but certainly not discount -it is so worth the better exprience tho- This is a store to browse, ask questions and take your time exploring.

Give Sportsmans a shot - and you'll say ""No Mo BevMo!""",1
"I love love love the chicken & hummus appetizer. Its served w/ sauteed spinach and pita. Although its an app, its large enough for a light meal. Most times, I get that w/ the beet salad and split it w/ a friend. Perfect. 

For those of you who avoid beets, I think you'll change your mind w/ this salad. The beets are sweet like candy.  Served w/ feta, mandarin oranges, candied pecans and a very unique pear dressing, you forget you're eating healthy. I've been trying to harvest the pear vinaigrette recipe forever!!! They won't give up the secret sauce! :( 

Enjoy!",1
"NO.  Don't go. Don't do it.  This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often.  

One other reviewer here made a wise statement - go the grocery store and buy frozen fish.  I promise it will be better than this.",0
The acoustics are pretty good for an amphitheatre.  The process required to acquire booze is a tad ridiculous but you have to remember that you are in Mesa.  This place would certainly rate higher if it was located in a city that allowed concerts to go past 10pm.,0
"As far as fast Japanese food at lunch this is as good as it gets.  They have a different Bento Box lunch special everyday.  The box comes with plenty to eat, including Miso Soup which arrives shortly after ordering.  The meal includes sushi, salad, rice, chicken (teriyaki or such), gyoza, some type of fried fish and an orange.  For about $8-$10 it's hard to find a better deal.  I would highly recommend CherryBlossom for those looking for a Japanese meal.  It is small, quiet and a little hard to see from the street, which makes it a unique place with low traffic, but high quality.",1
"Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...

AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say ""simple"" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!

Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?

This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.

You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say ""THANK YOU!!"" for the great service you provide and the products you offer.",1
"I had a good bad experience while at Cadillac ranch. The inside decor was pretty cool and had comfortable booths, which I appreciate. We ordered three different appetizers that were  on happy hour before our entrees. The Wontons, the queso dip, and the Chicken tenders. The tenders were good. They were beer battered and  tender. The queso dip was pretty bland and the chips awful. They weren't stale but just obviously super low quality. The Wontons were obviously frozen and sitting on a bed of syrup. It was like having desert and appetizers at the same time. When it came time to order entrees i was the last to do so. I asked my server about an option between three entrees and she danced around all of them suggesting that I have a pulled pork sandwich that was clearly less expensive than the ribs, steak or taco plate I inquired about. I should have headed her advice. It isn't every day a server tries to under sale you I ordered the ribs and was disappointed. the texture was off the flavor was bland except for the sauce which was spicy and not good enough to mask the bad flavor. My server Liz was awesome. She was attentive and friendly. She noticed I hadn't eaten my entree and took it away. The manager came back and was apologetic he offered me another entree and I took Liz's advice and got the pulled pork sandwich. It was much better. The staff was good and did there job very well. It isn't their fault the food quality is so bad.",0
"The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal.  Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged.  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era, eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat, and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives, all while having a merry time.

What's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century.  Once you pass through the gates, you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days.  Men, women, and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose.  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing, shopping, and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival.  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment, jousting tournaments, over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares, and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing, leatherworking, weaving, woodcarving, blacksmithing, candlemaking and pottery.

One specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it.  Here, a family of three (father, mother, and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press.  

The store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning.  The categories range from mythological symbols, to astrological, to even ancient Egyptian.  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin, they place a blank, either bronze or silver, between each dye and clamp it to a press.  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye, eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin.  

What's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol.  Additionally, what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away, making the production a very personal thing for the consumer.  

If you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon, which I would undoubtedly recommend, be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.",1
"Five Guys is good eats.  We've been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened.

Honestly, I don't think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger, but I like the selection of toppings (can you say, ""fresh jalapenos!"") and the great selection of sodas.

The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait.

I personally think it's a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!), but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience.

Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week, it's been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours, unless you want to wait for a table.

Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out, but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium.

3 tips:

-Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries, though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened.

-Ditto for the burgers.  Don't let the moniker ""Little Cheeseburger"" fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the ""Little"" one is perfectly sufficient for me, especially after I load up on toppings.

-Can't decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a 'half-half' order and ""POOF!"", you'll get it!

Enjoy!

UPDATE: Gotta drop 'em to 4 stars.  The last several visits, the fries have been soggy.  Once they were even opaque in the center --- not cooked!  Ask for them EXTRA CRISPY!!",1
"Finally a raw food cafe that isn't in Tempe.  Love their drinks and raw food menu.  Just wish their prices would come down bit.    

This is the type of place I could eat at everyday.  I know it is good because the afternoon lull doesn't happen to me when I eat here.    

I do NOT go daily, due to pricing, but I would like too, because I would simply live longer eating here.  Your body buzzes with clean energy (non-caffeine) after eating here.  

If you are a person who wants to be nice to your body.  Splurge and give your body what it craves....Enzymes.    

Who knew raw food was the answer to avoiding afternoon coffee.......?",1
"I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months. I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix, so I go to the 20th St & Camelback, Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations.  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT! They are clean, the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done.  What is it with the Camelback crowd?  The place really smells bad! It really needs a good cleaning. There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started.  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off, I swear he was sweating like a pig, left the equipment drenched! UGH!!!  Good God! I couldn't believe it, Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves?? The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front desk.....they should be cleaning something, anything.  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess!!  I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue! Maybe then they may clean up their act.",0
"I hardly ever give five star reviews. My experience at Culinary Dropout today prompted me to do so. The reason we checked this place out was because I had a 25% coupon from Fox RC for Labor Day. First things first: The employees are extremely good looking. There is lots of tattoos and bare skin. Our bartender was awesome. He answered all our dumb questions with a smile and made some killer drinks. I had the Bacon Infused Bloody Mary and my friend had the Acai Mojito. I will be going back again to have that Bloody Mary. It was SO good. We started out with the homemade chips and onion dip and it was delicious. We pretty much filled up on those before we got our meals. I ordered the Havarti Burger, my roommate got the chef salad, and my other friend got the canneloni. Everything was super good, but it was too much food! My burger melted in my mouth and I kept stealing bites of my friend's salad. So, in a nutshell:

- Great vibe.
- Great food.
- Great drinks.
- Hot employees.
- Clever menu titles/
- Great experience!",1

"I can't dance..yes I can!  Well tonight the hubby and I took our first dance lesson and what a hoot!  Had a blast.  The instructor's approach was clear and easy to follow.  She did a great job at blending focus on the instruction with keeping it fun and upbeat.  The facility is pleasant, immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time, not just during their lessons.
As mentioned in a previous review, they have a great deal for first time students.  The best thing for couples is that the price per lesson is the same whether for a single or a couple.   Because I've only done one lesson, and my first dance lesson every (well since high school, but the dinosaurs because extinct since then),  I'm looking forward to more lessons and the opportunity to add a star.",1
"My company is into giving back to the community, so they invited my department to volunteer at St. Mary's during work-hours this week. It was a great experience and I would do it again! We filled boxes that get passed out to families in need. It makes me feel so good to volunteer and help others. And I feel so lucky to work for a company that supports and encourages this kind of service! 

St. Mary's was the first Food Bank in the world, they have expanded into a national effort. I also learned that 1 in 5 children wake-up and go to sleep hungry, 1 in 7 adults (18-64) have to decide between eating or buying things like gas/rent/bills/etc, and 1 in 12 seniors (64+) are struggling with bills/medical needs/food.

"I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of.

We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us.  

We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if I'm going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesn't like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesn't get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL.",1
"I got 3 strikes at Verde, hence...I'm out! Strike 1: Not very vegetarian friendly. Strike 2: They have all the necessary items to make nachos, but when asked if they would make me nachos I got a very quick and blunt ""NO"". Strike 3: When forced to order a meat dish and request they not include the meat (the most EXPENSIVE ingredient) not only did they make no attempt to substitute the meat with maybe beans, or guac, or extra cheese, they still charged full price! I don't want to eat meat and I sure don't want to pay for it. 

And as far as the food, well, they got that part right, for a place that serves fine fast food, when you ask me how my meal was, my response would be ""Fine"".",0
"OK, I'm somewhat between 3 stars and 4 stars on this.  I really want to like this restaurant a lot so maybe I will have to return again and try another dish.

Positives:

Price!!!!  Wow, the prices are amazing.  I got the hand pulled spicy noodle dish ($4.00), my boyfriend got the hand pulled pork noodles ($5.95) and we shared the pork dumplings ($4.95).

The dishes provided rather generous portions (we ended up taking half of our meals to go).  

The dumplings were quite tasty (approx 8 large dumplings)

I got the passion fruit smoothie with boba which was quite good (I love bubble tea so much and this place is pretty legit).

The restaurant was really clean and the window to watch the noodles being made was really interesting and ingenious!

Negatives:

My noodle dish just really didn't have a whole lot of flavor and was not even remotely spicy for being titled 'spicy noodles.'  

All of the food was really rather greasy.  The sauce for the noodles was pretty much pure oil and the dumplings/sauce were pretty oily too (but still tasty).  I was just hoping for a bit of a cleaner feeling meal instead of heavy greasy food.  Maybe if I try one of the soup dishes next time I will have better luck!  

The experience was overall a good one and I would like to try this place again, I was just a bit disappointed with the grease content of the foods which gave me a bit of stomach ache.  Regardless, this place is worth a shot!",1
"I finally tried out Valle Luna on Sunday.  I must say that the food is authentic and one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Valley.  The salsa and chips are homemade and simply tasty.  I had the fish tacos that were fried and came with cabbage and soft shells - delicious.

The waitress that served me was attentive.  I must say that the seating did take a while and I was one of two people in line, hence no five star here.  The portions were decent, the tacos could have had more fish in them.

Overall I am pleased with the restaurant and you will be too.",1
"Unique atmosphere in the city of Glibert with AMAZING food....  

Beware some weekends the line is super long but its worth the wait... be prepared to eat outside in a nice shady area enjoying a farm like atmosphere...

Good seafood is hard to find in Az & Farm grill does a great job.... also great burgers!  

If you don't mind driving out to Gilbert its 1 of the best places to eat in the Phx area..",1
"I had the chicken teriyaki bowl (with extra veggies and easy on the brown rice) and it was a nice lunch.  Nice alternative to fast food, although those sauces don't exactly make it healthy.",1
"I can't believe this wasn't reviewed yet!  This place rocks, and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town. She's reasonable in price, thorough in her evaluations, and super kind. She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly, and she talks about her own pets and has compassion! 

When our cat Everett died, she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process, but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint ""ornament"" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.  Never had a vet do anything so kind.  

We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.  I know a good vet. Go here. Please go here!",1
"Great donuts but horrible service... Didn't get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited English speaking employee. She claimed, in broken English, to only speak Spanish. She understood ONLY the word ""dozen"" and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us, then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone!
Donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to Bosa.",0
"I had the terrible decision to make to euthanize my 20 year old cat, Bandit. I was going to go to the Emergency Animal Clinic off of Scottsdale Rd. further north but I had previously had a bad experience there. I saw there were some good reviews for this Emergency Animal Hospital and, thank God I did. They were so kind and compassionate. They let us take our time, never rushed us. They knew it was a very painful thing to have to do. They made one of the worst things I have ever had to do as 'easy' as they possibly could have. They eased my nagging doubts about it without putting words in my mouth. I am ever grateful for their kindness on that incredibly sad day and would recommend them to anyone who has an animal friend who needs some emergency care.",1
"The features in the room seem outdated.  The room was a sauna when I got in and could not fix the problem because the thermostat was hard to figure out.  I woke up in the middle of the night because it was unbearable and a staff person did come by and was able to make the room a little cooler.

I like the check-in and check-out kiosks so I don't have to wait on a line for a live person who seemed to be just chatting away with someone.",0
"Went here for lunch after riding dirt bikes in the desert. We have had Mellow Mushroom in Georgia and Florida, but this one was top notch.  Very clean, staff very friendly , and food OMG to die for. 

The garlic cheese bread is fantastic, and the calzones are my favorite.",1
"Dr. Plotnik was great, took a great deal of time answering all my questions and explaining everything I was unclear about.  I will say some of the office staff weren't the friendliest, customer service oriented people and it did take 1 hour to get from the waiting room to the exam room.  Overall the most important aspect is quality experienced care for something as critically important as your child's vision.",1
"Nice views of South Mountain, lots of elevation changes and some tricky par 3's make this a very solid muni and probably the toughest in town.  

First my two complaints: the chipping area should have a few more holes with a slightly larger green, and the neighborhood is atrocious.  

Aguila has four features not often found at municipal golf courses:
1) You need to drive the ball well to score well here.  From a lot the tee boxes, the driving area often looks smaller than it is; so, confidence with the big stick is key.  
2) Absence of generous flat lies in the fairway; even if you drive the ball well, you are not always rewarded and are sometimes faced with side-hill lies.  
3) Very tough holes #9 and #18.  Hey, I like to score low as much as the next guy, but the thing about city courses is that they often give you easy closing holes with a good birdie chance; NOT the case here.  Rated 3 and 2 handicaps respectably, #9 and #18 take advantage of the same water hazard (similar to the closing holes at Karsten @ ASU) and put in play some penal, deep fairway bunkers that require precision drives and good approach shots.  #18 plays 470 yds+ from the tips, so if you hit a bomb, you still don't have a wedge in your hand.  
4) Two true risk / reward par 4's - both with water, both greens are drivable from the tee.  #8 is not a guaranteed birdie from the greenside bunkers, but they're a good bailout.  #17 is longer and is a slightly more daunting drive with a more generous bailout option to the right, these are great holes.

A tip: 
Take advantage of the par 5's; all but the last one is reachable in two (at least, that's been my experience).  There are only two par 3's that I would consider good birdie chances (#13 and #16), so if you can roll in a few putts, you're set.

Go past Tent City, drive further south towards South Mountain, and you'll find a nice municipal course in South Phoenix.",1
Great place to go for a walk or bike ride.,1
"One of our Lexus car keys/key fob was cracked and needed to be replaced. Going to the dealer would be anywhere from $250-$400! I found Alcatraz on Yelp and called Todd. Todd did exactly what he said had to be done and the charge was $75.00. Todd is knowledgeable and knows what he is doing. Most other locksmiths couldn't do the job because they don't have the machine necessary to fabricate the key. I am a home inspector in the Phoenix metro area, and before I left with my new key, I took more than a few of Todd's business cards that I plan to give to my clients, so that when they move into their new home, they can call someone who is reliable, knowledgeable and trustworthy to help with their home security.  Thanks, Yelp, as I found Alcatraz on your site.",1
Pet smart did a better job at grooming my dog than my last mobile groomers. They cut and wash my dogs hair just how i like them. Service was nice the young ladies were always helpful since two dogs on a leash can be difficult. I shall return to get my dogs groomed here.  Would recommend.,1
"Great China   chinese restaurant and super buffet there is no the in the name.But there is some good food inside the place.the decor is average and are booth was comfy but well worn.The buffet had about 80 items ,about the super buffet requirement.They had a small sushi section and the sushi was very tasty.The wonton soup i had was very hot and good it had most of your typical trays with a couple of different twists on some like the stuffed clams were huge and and they had some good sole,that thet called snow fish?When i left this place i was stuffed and everything i ate was good.So yes Great China gets 4 stars.And for Norm R. they got the almond cookie packages",1
"For those of you who love Indian/Pakistani food, but hate dives, Z-Grill just may turn your whole world upside down. In all foodie honesty, Z-Grill is home to some of the best Indo-Pak food I've ever had. This praise comes with a reminder though...it is divey.

Z-Grill is located inside Zam Zam World Market, which is a decent little grocery, but it lacks the umph that other well-known ethnic groceries delivery. With that being said though, other groceries lack Z-Grill, and this is why it matters...

Everything I've tried from the restaurant, and I mean everything thus far, delivers. From the hummus, to the samosas, to the chana and even to the paneer masala and chicken karahi, I've only been disappointed when I realized that I was down to the last bite. The flavors are robust, the sauces are spicy and, surprisingly, the prices are unbelievably reasonable.  It's safe to say that I'm addicted to this place. 

**A word of caution when trying Z-Grill. They are sometimes out of items on the menu. I find that charming cause they have to make everything from scratch, others might not. If they happen to be out of something, do yourself a favor and just try something else.**

I cannot say enough good things about the food from Z-Grill. This is a must-try in the valley for anyone who has a love for spicy Indo-Pak food. Go try it!",1
"Great selection of vitamins and supplements, good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while I'm picking up the goods for myself. Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward.

I also like that they are not ""all over you"" like the other local chain is when you walk in the door. 

I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback!",1
just another big store with everything everywhere.,0
"The pizza's OK, not anything to write home about.  I sat on the outdoor patio, which is on the main street, so while entertaining to watch all the people go by (and there's a wide variety), if you're table's right along the outside edge of the patio (which I wasn't), you may end up interacting with the transients coming by.  So, I got to observe everyone going by without having to interact with them, which was just fine by me, because I do like to people watch.",0
"This deli style restaurant has everything you want.  Good service, inviting atmosphere, super clean appearance and most of all freshly prepared food that is attractive and delicious!

I had the Salmon BLT.  I did not even have to ask the friendly order taker to make the bacon crisp or the salmon to be slightly charred.  Everything about this wonderful sandwhich was perfect.  To be honest, I would switch out the the shredded iceberg lettuce for spinach leaves.  Still the sandwhich was terrific with it's nice proportion and the aioli sauce to bring it all together.

My dining comanion had the spinach and sirloin salad which was also completely finished at the end of the meal.  By the looks of the empty bowl it came in- it must have been really good!

There are some other items on the menu I look forward to trying out next time, like the wood fired pizzas and the burgers.
Great location in the heart of old town Gilbert.  Galleries and other small businesses are in the same area.

A great find.  I will definitely go back!",1
"Loving this neighborhood froyo joint.  The topping selections are interesting and slightly different thatn some other places.  They have these yummy little chocolate rocks...kinda like candy coated chocolate shaped like rocks.  They were fun and tasty.  A nice assortment of topping sauces too...peanut butter, mallow, strawberry.  This place gets jam packed but they do have a good amount of seating both inside and out.",1
"I love this place. I'm mostly here at dinner time to pick up my favorite roasted turkey artichoke panini and sometimes salad and soup as well! The staff is super friendly and recognize when my boyfriend and I show up, maybe because he can never leave without getting a dozen of their amazing cookies! The manager Kaylee is fabulous, she makes us feel right at home and is never unsatisfactory. They may have a smaller parking lot but I guess I have always had good luck with finding a spot! I know I will continue to come back for more.",1
I used Full Circle Auto Body after my daughter's car was in an accident. They were very knowledgable and helpful about insurance issues and got the car repaired quickly. They post progress of your vehicle with photos on their website which is so cool. I'll definitely use them again if the occassion arises.,1
"I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Ted's yet! By far, one of my favorite places to go. You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price. I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle. I also like the corn dog and onion rings. I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7. Love it!

Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice.",1
"I always connect here because I fly US Airways from Las Vegas.  But everytime I have a stop over here, other than a major back track to the Bay Area, I don't really mind coming here because it's a well maintained airport. It might look old but it is always clean. 

I'm only here about 1 or 2 hours at a time but I can't help but notice all these restaurants in here, if you're hungry and don't mind 'airport prices', never fear selection is here.  

Also be prepared to walk close to a mile to your connecting flight.  There's LONG hallways here. Don't worry, they have standing walking escalators.",1
"Sucker Punch Sally's is a nice place to grab breakfast on Mill.  The prices are alright and their hashbrowns are made the way I likes 'em.  Usually people serve up this mash of whatever-the-fuck but here, they grate the potatoes and serve them crispy.  The way I likes 'em.

I'm sort of burnt out on places with a 50's motif, but whatever.  I like the colors.  It's kind of cozy.

One thing that bothers me:  The name ""Sucker Punch Sally's"" sounds like something disgusting you'd head about in high school.  You never heard of a sucker punch sally?  It's when a girl....

Nah, but as a whole, it's a cool alternative to have in Tempe.  Read my review on Harlow's.  I like Harlow's, but I always get diarrhea.  IHOP is full of olds and I don't particularly enjoy pancakes.  They hit the bottom of my gut with the gravitational force of Jupiter.  Now we've got Sucker Punch and it's pretty chill.",0
"I have to say i avoid this store as much as i can. I have lived in this same neighborhood for 15 years,so i have had to go to this store many times over the years. They just never understand Customer service at this location.  It is very close to where i live but, i would rather drive a little further for fresh and Easy. However, i this night i thought i would just stop here for a quick shopping experience.                                                           My boyfriend was really sick and i wanted to take him some fresh Chicken soup that they make and sell here. So here i am at 6:45 at night on a weekday. One cashier is open ,yes only one in a store that size!!!   Mind you the store is packed.  The line is all the way down the frozen food isle.   There are 4 registers where you can check your self out / But, no one is there to help them( all 4 busy)..    And it is winter in molasasville. So slow. I am sorry and don't want to sound like i am above it all,but i do not have time to waste like this.                                                                         This is not a one time  experience either. This is one of the biggest reasons i hate going to this store. I have been to other Safeways around the valley that are not like this.   The one on 7th Street for instance. They never behave this way.   Sorry to say i will continue to avoid this shop!!",0

"I am not religious, but I will be the first person to admit I thank God for this place--and the neighboring Windsor. Seriously... a latte, ice cream on a waffle cone and a cocktail all within feet of each other. Dear Lord, I have reached bliss. I can die happy now.

Some people gripe that the flavors are not strong enough. 
I prefer to gripe that they aren't open 24/7 because this is my bliss and damn it... I need it at all hours.

Always friendly.
Always clean.
Always awesome.

Yes, there is heaven.",1
"Best donuts in the valley.

I like a variety of donuts (my favorites, though are raised sugar and raised glaze), and all the donuts here are great.  Never too heavy, always tasting fresh.",1
"How could you not love this place?  Not only is the food fantastic and consistent, it has a great atmosphere and an adorable ""grocery"" shop next door.  It's a great place to people watch!  (Don't forget to check out the wine section--not only is the wine random, it's affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labels)

After moving here from San Diego, I've been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix.  This is the one place that I LOVE!  I think it offers something for everyone, however my go to is the Venice Beach Burrito.  It's such a casual spot--you order from the counter, find a table, and wait for them to call you to let you know your food is ready to be devoured.  There's tables both inside and out, and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles!


The only thing I've ever been disappointed by is the sangria, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white sangria.  I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it.

I had never been here for lunch until this past weekend--it was always my late morning brunch spot.  Technically, I believe its a pizza place, but I've never had a pizza.  Although, they look quite good!  I ordered their tuna sandwich this past weekend, which came with a side of fruit and pickles.  The bread was thin and grilled panini style, and the tuna salad definitely did not disappoint!",1
"Hey Guys, 
This place is awesome....but I could be jaded because of all the wonderful wines I sampled! From the gris, cabs, sparkling shiraz, riesling to the chardonnay, this shop had what we were looking for and what we weren't looking for! The atmosphere was amazing and quiet for a Thursday night get together. Our hostess was sweet and doted to our every need. The food was amazing. I completely recommend the crocodile pot stickers. 
For exotic wines and exotic meats appetizers, look up Down Under Wines!",1
"This wasn't the first time, but we went to Tutti Santi for a family Christmas Eve Dinner.  All I have to say is that everything was simply perfect.  Not only the food, but the service.  Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great.  

I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate. 

Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.  Dad cleaned the plate.  From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.   

Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.  Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.   Mom didn't clean the plate, she has a small stomach.  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal.

Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.  I'm glad we couldn't get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.
  
Gratzi and Buon Natale.

Oh yeah, I didn't get the raviolis this time, but if you've haven't had them it's a must try.",1
I believe this place is over-hyped.  the menu is overpriced.  the portions are small.  the meat is low quality.  slow service.  sterile decor.,0
"*cut to scene* Friday night, lounging around discussing the lameness of the evening, ready to indulge in a new adventure. six pack of Newcastle sits untouched in fridge and bellys aching for fulfillment. yelp.com search reveals a local japanese eatery nearby. 

enter, Hana.

first off, pre-game excitement for this BYOB, local, fresh sushi spot. Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn't lose any of it's remarkably smooth quality.  first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start.

the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough.

our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about 4 inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head.  he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friend's house. 

I will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with.",1
"Dangerous place to shop!  Lots of neat imported goodies, many in sample sizes so you can try them out before buying the bigger size.

I might even ask Santa for a gift card to World Market for myself!",1

"Any parent with young children can vouch for me on this one...keeping the attention of a three year old is, to say the least, difficult. They need constant stimulation, otherwise, there very well may be hell to pay!

Enter, the Children's Museum of Phoenix!

The facility is an old school, converted into three stories of pure fun and energy! 

After you pay your standard $11/person older than 1 (or your $22 for up to four people with a Groupon), you encounter a three story art project that can only be described as AWESOME! There are multiple ways in which your children can traverse this mammoth. The various pathways challenge children in strength, balance, and critical thinking skills...all of the ways you want to challenge your child!

After your child has lost interest in this room, you progress to the second floor. Here, children get to experiment with a really cool board that can only be described as ""Plinko-esque"". Here, children can alter the path of a falling object by changing different platforms. My daughter thought I was a genius because I was able to predict where her object would land every time...it's a shame she'll ultimately realize how routine that feat really is.  

After Plinko, children can either go to the trike wash, build forts, or they can head to the art room. After some laps through the wash, my daughter wanted to head into the art room. Being that we went right before Halloween, our child had the opportunity to make black play dough (to make spiders), she got to paint on a giant rocket ship, and then she was able to make a spooky tree out of a brown paper bag. Such simple activities...such great opportunities!

After cleaning all of the paint from her smock, we made the journey up...to the third floor. Here, children get to play grown-ups. There's a mock supermarket that allows children to either shop, ring up merchandise, or work in the stock room of a miniature grocery store.

After shopping, our daughter wanted to work at the little ice cream stand located just outside of the grocery. We had fake ice cream cones and sat at the tiny bistro set while we watched children make their way through the noodle forest. We then made our way to the end of the hall to race miniature race cars on roller skate wheels.

Being only three floors, our day at the museum only lasted a couple of hours...but in those short hours, my daughter never stopped smiling!

How on earth could you rate any place less than five stars when it brings so much joy to YOUR pride and joy?",1

I have since revisited the store several times and I would be remiss if I didn't update my rant.  Debbie the owner has been friendly and helpful ever since I asked nicely.  I suppose with the amount of lookie loos or window shoppers in Old Town I can relate to the lack of enthusiasm.,1
"Wow! This newly opened little food shop in the Mekong Plaza is fantastic. Very authentic Hue Food. Although I'm not a Vietnamese, I have been to Hue in Vietnam and had their famous Bun Bo Hue. Must say that this store was very close to the authentic Bun Bo Hue. The pork hock and the other meat used was very tender, the noodle was perfect. The broth is lightly flavored so that you can use the Shrimp Paste for those who like it a bit more salty. The veggie was very generous.

The Banh Beo was another neat Hue snack. It's a very thin rice cake snack which is steamed. You dip it in Fish Sauce. It was very nice and moist.

Their menu is pretty limited as they only have about 6-7 items, but they are definitely featuring the best of hue to serve. Very impressed to see. 
There was a good crowd too, so lot's of people have been dying for some nice Hue food.

Only thing to note is they were a bit disorganized the opening weekend as their register was not even working, and the service was a bit slow. I'm sure after a few weeks, this place will be running smoothly.",1

"U.S. Egg is situated directly across the street from Denny's.  A nicer and classier environment than Denny's but the quality of food is similar (well, slightly better) and a bit pricier.  Service here was really friendly however.

Ordered the Triple Play (pancakes, eggs, and bacon) but substituted the regular pancakes with their famous protein pancakes which are packed with oatmeal, blueberries and cinnamon.  Bacon and eggs are always good, tough to mess those up.  The protein pancakes had a nice flavor, but the oatmeal which is mixed within the batter before they are poured on to the griddle actually messes with fluffy texture that I enjoy whenever I eat pancakes.

If you are really big on breakfast and brunch food and don't want to eat at a nationwide chain restaurant it may be worth it to check this place out, just temper your expectations on the protein pancakes.",0
"Wow what a fun little antique,etc. store I stumbled across the other day!  I stopped in at the Starbucks for a refresher and noticed all of this funky stuff out in front of the store!

some vintage, shabby chic, crystal door pulls - industrial - toys. The owners are great and are going to help me find a little period table I've been searching for. Lot of great accents!  I'm hooked!  I'll be back with a vengence!",1
"I wanted to love this place so bad considering I've lived in Venezuela and hadn't tasted some of this country's food in over 17 years.  However it pains me to write that I was pretty disappointed.  The server, who is assume owned the restaurant, is a very nice guy but forgot my stepson's food and didn't realize until 15 mins after he dropped off our food.  My cachapa was burnt and dripping with butter.  Don't get me wrong, cachapas usually are rockin with butter but this was oozing everywhere.  The arepa was pretty decent and the only saving light of the meal but overall this experience left me wanting more.",0
"Another fox restaurant concept-- healthy and simple. I liked going here, the service was great but the portions were kinda small and most of the patrons were really ugly. I did have something pretty amazing there-- a marscapone creamed corn-- it was awesome!",1
"I'm fairly new to the whole Costco experience. Now that we've bought a house it's time to buckle down and buy in bulk! As as new user I'd thought it would be helpful to post the following neat services Costco has to offer:

1. Great deals on contact lenses. Before I would buy my contacts from justlenses.com but through Costco I bought 8 boxes (a year's supply) and received $50 off! $25 off via instant rebate at the cashier and another $25 off via mail-in rebate which came in less than a month after the order.

2. PIZZA AND HOT DOGS. The take out pizza is huge and only 9.99 and the hot dog and coke pair is only 1.50. These make for a delicious and quick lunch. They also have smoothies and salads if you're looking for something on the ""lighter"" side.

3. Food expos come and go often. Recently I got a deal on a 10 pack of pita bread, a huge container of hummus and pita chips for 12 bucks. The company was from California and let customers try as many samples as they pleased.  It was well worth the money and super fresh!

4. And here's where I feel Costco has really benefited me. My fiance and I booked our honeymoon to Tahiti through Costo Travel! I'm big on comparing prices before making a big purchase and Costco was hands down the best price. It included seven nights, hotel and round-trip airfare all for one great deal. The customer service agent I spoke with was friendly and more than willing to answer my 500 questions about travel. I would recommend Costco Travel to anybody looking for reliable customer service and excellent travel/airfare packages.",1
"Over the top cheesesteaks. Best in Phoenix, perhaps the world. Amazing food and friendly service. Best ever.",1
"An unclear menu and chalkboard signage, as well as lack of information from our server, lead to confusion.

Like most have said before, my friend and I were very pleased with the atmosphere at Tryst Café in terms of its decor and layout. However, information about specials on the menu and two separate chalkboards lead to confusion about what specials were available (given the day of the week and hour of the day.) When we inquired with our server, she didn't know and had to double check what was included, when specials were available and for what price. I'm not sure if she was new to this job or just insufficiently trained.

Fortunately, Tryst Café delivered in other ways. The drinks were sufficiently strong. My friend tells me her two glasses of Montpellier Cabernet Savignon (pictured) were delicious. My Tryst Pepino was fine, though was missing the mint garnish described on their menu.

The Humus Trio (pictured) was delicious and came with slices of fresh cucumber however, it did not come with the traditional side of pita bread which had to be ordered separately. The Steak Salad (pictured) was amazing and the chunks of meat were oh, so, tender and juicy!

I hope to revisit Tryst Café sometime soon. My only hope is that they clear up some of the confusion about what specials are available and appropriately train their staff to know what is actually included, when specials are available and for what price.",1
"This is my second time @ J&G's. First time I hoenstly hated it. Second time WAYYY better!
My bf & I stayed @ the Phoenician for a little stay-cation a few weekends ago. We decided to give J&G's another shot. We are both happy we did! When we came in our table was not ready so they sat us at the bar. We got 2 drinks and snacked on yummy popcorn and nuts - SO good! I wanted to bring it to the table lol - don't worry I totally didn't!
We ordered a bottle of white wine and my bf ordered the Crispy Calamari ($12) to start. I was shocked when he said it was really tasty! He is so picky with his calamari, so already off to a good start! I ordered the Arugula and Boston Lettuce Mustard Vinaigrette salad ($10 i know I am such a cheap date) and he ordered the Pacific Halibut Summer Vegetable Vin Cilantro ($30). We also got a side of Roasted Mushrooms Herbs and Chilies ($9) and Steamed Broccoli ($9). Overall the meal was very good! All the flavors were amazing and so was the service. We will definitely return! :)",1
"It's a cafe on a resort, so you figure you're about to drop major amounts of dough on average tasting food, right? Happily, here it's not *that* bad. 

I got to order 3 different things from here. The Java Chip blended coffee (possibly actually called a frappe) was.. good, but not $5 good. Starbucks offers better quality, and premade mix, for less. 

The second thing I ordered was a scoop of rose water gelato and a scoop of mango peach gelato during half price gelato. Much better. The gelato was smooth, rich, and very freshly flavored. 

Finally I had a feta cheese and spinach empanada. This was also very good, the feta being subtle and the empanada having ample amounts of spinach baked in a perfectly crusty bread.

Overall, good quality food, OK quality drink, decent value for your money.",1
"I used to frequent Homme for Tuesday night karaoke, Friday night French Kiss, and spent Saturday nights upstairs. I have to say that for the sheer, unimaginable amount of times I wastedly bowled over the dance floor, tumbled down the stairs, or made out with someone I never intended to, Homme has never done me wrong. The bartenders on both floors are fantastic, though the upstairs is better tailored for more intimate lounging. I've been to countless events here, and they've been well-organized and (as far as I can remember) really fun. There' s a great crowd here, and you won't feel like you're dancing in a dirty, sweaty shoebox like other hip dives in the valley. 

The parking situation is shady on weekends. I recommend going early to avoid irrational towings and cover charges; while it's purportedly not socially acceptable to leave the house before 10p, you'll be glad you did.",1

"I was sworn to secrecy when we first came here with friends several years ago.  I think it's some of the best Italian in town.  It isn't fancy (a plus, in my book).  It's small, so sometimes there can be a wait involved. Even though its small, because of the very personal service by the owner, the service can be lacking or distracted.  The food, however, is well worth it!   I try to get something new each time I go, and I've never been disappointed.",1
"A decent southwestern restaurant if you have a hankering for it.  The margarita was good and the Taos combo was also good.  The service was attentive and bumped this up to a three star review.  Otherwise, the food is good not great.",0
"Stingray Sushi is where we go for sushi .

Sleek ,beautiful interior and very ,very clean ! This dining house has large 13 or so foot doors that when open ,seamlessly link the patio potion with the interior dining area ,a very good design flow,indeed. The patio itself is very comfortable as it has great seating .
The service has always been wonderful ,the sushi very fresh with beautiful presentation .We like to get the sushi boat , edamame ,and beef yakitori.The fire dragon rolls( though on the small side) are also yummy.

Drinks are very good here ..the sinful orchid (yum)a very pretty drink .And their HH is really good as well .",1
"I had always heard great things about Pita Jungle, but it wasn't until a recent visit there that I became a believer. Really great food for a reasonable place!",1
"They added broasted chicken to their menu... I love me some broasted chicken, so in I went to investigate.

I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.

To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor, and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it. I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.

I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine.",0
"Postinos a spot for high rollin' winos. 

You woke up at noon and had breakfast during lunchtime, so the next logical step is to have lunch food during dinner time, with some wine. This is where postino's comes in. 

The menu is full of salads, Paninis, bruschetta and a few apps. There is a large by the glass wine menu ($8-$14) and hipster cool ambiance. 

Service here is great, the patio is quite nice with heaters, a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers.  Great for a date, hanging with friends and conversation.

We started with the Bella Postino $9 Crustini with a artichoke dip and a hummus. The artichoke dip was great as any fat laden dip would be. The humus was ok but I am a hummus  snob.

For our main we had the Vegetarian Panini ($9.75) It was good and moist with hummus roasted tomatoes olives and an artichoke spread, the focaccia bread was well toasted from the Panini press.

We also had the mediterranean  salad 8.75 which is a romaine salad with copious amounts of feta. Pretty good as I do like cheese but maybe not as healthy as one would want from a salad.

For desert we had a crem burle, simple not to sweet and well executed a classic.",1
"Finally had a chance to watch a game here! Just moved to Surprise in July, and have been waiting for spring training. Very easy parking, and the seats are great! It does not matter where you sit. The diner have great food. I will be coming here a lot!",1
"Love this place !

Food is spicy and always cooked just right.  Menu changes every so often and have nightly specials too.  Service is great.  No matter what night you go it is busy.

it is a great little find.",1
"A very inadequate meal and expensive for the low quality food you get.  Ordered the veal sorrentino and it was not enjoyable to eat.  Very dry, tough...just gross.  Caesar salad was also disgusting and unpleasant, saturated in dressing.  I did like the atmosphere, laid back and comfortable.  Knowing that Pasta Brioni is down the street, I won't go back.",0
"Food is just ok, but the problem is it's way overpriced! I mean $9 for loco moco? Outrageous!",0
"Busy place, but everyone is nice and I keep having to go to the cell lot because of late baggage from my original destination. They charge a lot to deliver so better get your bags checked 45 mn early...",1
"I'm happy to say that I've incorporated Guedo's into my weekly routine.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is spot-on. I've read several reviews where people complained about the food being overpriced but I really don't mind paying a little extra when it comes supporting local businesses; especially a staple of the community like Guedo's.  If you're looking for a place with awesome food and an owner who cares to learn your name, come to Guedo's.",1
"My husband and I both rate this a 3. Food was good, but not great. Fresh veggies and nice flavors. Dont know if bread is made in house. The bread on my sandwich was falling apart, which made it difficult to enjoy.  I think the owner or manager was there, and I expected him to be introducing himself or welcoming us in some way,  but he seemed to be hard at work. I think as a new business, it would be a good idea to be more welcoming to people who are willing to try something new. Also,  there was a girl working there with a really dirty apron and she cussed while we were ordering. Very unprofessional and unsanitary, especially if the owner was there. Also,  wish they had a soup without a cream based broth. Maybe we'd try again for b reakfast?",0
"Best Chinese food in the Valley. As others have said, salad dressing is addictive as IS available to take home in containers. Shrimp dishes are outstanding with large, plump high quality pieces of shrimp. I have never had even an average dish here. Go and enjoy!",1
"I can't speak for the Vet portion, dog training or any other service, except the grooming dept.

I take my dog in there during the Winter to get groomed, shampooed and nails clipped, because sometimes its too cold out to dry him off.  The girls in the Grooming dept. are very nice and accomodating.  They treat my dog well, and always have nice compliments about him. T

They also do an excellent job and his nails are always done right.  I've taken him elsewhere ONCE and they trimmed his nails down so much, that it hurt him to jump.  I thought he had an arthritic condition, when I realized that he had his nails done, and sure enough, he bounced back a week later.

These girls know what they're doing, and a couple of them have been there for a few years, as I recognize at least one or 2 of them every time I go in. Even to shop.

Thanks ladies!",1
"Growing up in Tempe, I've been to the Rooste a few times. Overall, the experience is good but nothing to write home about.

One of my recent visits was on New Year's Eve. I made a reservation ahead of time and the process was perfect. They said upon arrival, if there is a wait for tables we will be bumped to the top of the list. When we arrived, the hosting staff said it was going to be a 30 minute wait. I was a little confused but no point in causing a fuss because we didn't have a strict time schedule for the evening. We walked over to the outside patio to check on the view. Within 5 minutes our buzzer went off and we were seated. Our server was fantastic and friendly. The food was delicious with LARGE portions. And surprisingly not as expensive as i thought it would be.

My next visit was about a week ago on a Saturday night. We forgot to make a reservation so when we arrived we found out it was going to be an hour wait. We waited maybe 30 minutes before we were seated. Our server, however, was not as wonderful as our visit before. It took 20 minutes to get waters and she kept blaming the bus boys for everything. The food this time was OK. My dad's prime rib came out cold, like it was straight from the fridge. All the side dishes were cold or overcooked. It was a less than stellar experience this time around. If I hadn't been here before, I certainly would not return.

If you want to give it a shot, I'd say go for it but don't expect the best meal you've ever had. The view and atmosphere is what makes the restaurant.",0
"On my second week receiving a small mixed box for Nature's Garden and LOVE it!  It is more than enough for my fiance and I.  It is the easiest way to get fresh, organic, and local produce, especially since it is delivered right to my door.  It helps learn what is in season and how to make great new recipes!",1
"We have been eating here for years. I am as picky of a new yorker as they get (with food). I will say we do not eat there Monday or Tuesday's, The cook must be different, its not as good on those days. The rest of the week is 5 stars all the way.Great sesame chicken,fried rice, lo mien etc. Highly suggest.",1
"Okay, did I say bad??
WORSE.
Negative five stars.

From San Diego,
1. they made us wait in line for ticketing.
2. Made us go check our bags

3. Bag agent told us the flight has been delayed 35 min and we have to wait in the ""special needs"" line bc we were gonna miss our connection flight. 

4. Booked another flight. Meanwhile got barked at my a brainless, incompetent, mean lady that was a complete b*tch to us.
She told us there was plenty of time for our next flight and that we should patiently stand in line (and miss that flight).

5. Got on the runway. Plane circled around for about an hour. didn't take off.
6. ""mechanical problems"".
7. kept ppl on the plane for another hour.
8. kicked everybody off saying we weren't taking off on this plane.

9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didn't move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook)

10. hours later after not knowing what to do with us, they placed us in a hotel in downtown SD.
11. We were to take an 8 PM flight the next day to LAX and then 2 hr and 45 min layover.
12. 11:45 PM plane from LAX to Tokyo.... scheduled 4 AM landing in the far east, you kidding me? 
13. THEY LOST MY LUGGAGE. 

~~*~*~*~*~*~*~* another incident:

LAX to Tokyo: ""mechanical problems""
stayed another hour on the plane.
Had them shuttle us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere.
Lost luggage on the way there. It fell out of a bus!

Next morning, 8 AM plane to Busan, Korea.

Seriously, you expect me to go to work on Monday after all this sh*t?!
Sorry Delta, I'm so exhausted, sick and tired of you.
F*CK YOU guys and your incompetence and sh*tty customer service  too.",0
Gotta love a place open late in Phoenix. 2.50 petite martinis after midnite; yes please!,1
"There food is pretty good here but they have a lot of different brews, I tried a pumpkin beer witch was very good. This place used to be real quite and unnotice now it's always busy and very crowded. It is located away from mill ave by about 3 miles so if your trying to bar hop make sure you have a dd and stop by this place.",1
"I'd characterize myself as a Pho Ho (I know that doesn't rhyme) so this rating is going to be lower than what other people may thing simply because my standards for Pho are snobbishly high.

A very cute place, the decor and ambiance seems built very much upon the words ""serenity"" and ""harmony"", which is great, but as you might tell with the tone of this post, comes off a little corny.

That said, the food here is not too bad.  For lunch, it's a decently priced meal for a lot of grub.

I got the Shrimp & Pork Spring Rolls and the Pho (which they call Beef Noodles I believe).  

My first impression unfortunately when the app came out was that the Spring Rolls used iceberg lettuce instead of basil or mint or a more dark green leafy green.  The iceberg lettuce gave the Spring Rolls a cheaper feel that I didn't really enjoy.

The Pho was better though they seemed quite stingy on the accoutrement, as I got two jalapeno slices and a sorry looking stem of basil.  In addition, the thin slices of beef were definitely overcooked and tasted not unlike a sponge.  But the noodles themselves were solid and the broth with a little Sriracha got my blood and tastebuds pumping.

I don't know if I'll come back but I would say for lunch, this place is not a bad place to introduce somebody to Vietnamese food.",0
"What can I say...the food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere is sexy yet comfortable.  But the real stars of the show where the staff!  Everyone was exceptional, funny and charming: a dashing maitre'd, a handsome and truly helpful waiter, the chef was warm and happy to explain their signature Chinese oven even though I'm sure he has to do that a thousand times a night and the support staff...wonderful.  The water ninja is not to be missed...this guy sneaks in and fills your glass with such speed and accuracy that water tension alone keeps the glass just slightly more than 100% full.  This guy amazed us with his serving mastery again and again while his plate clearing partner in crime delighted us with a quick coin trick.  Wonderful!",1
"Delish!!!!!! x 100!!

Love, love, love this place. This is the place that made me a Vietnamese fan for sure. My friend brought me here and I was blown away but the tastiness of their food. Their spring rolls are so yummy! The chicken noodle soup flavor is a winner in my book! Everything on the menu is delicious, though I haven't tried is all, I'm sure it is!",1
"Ace and fried mushrooms at Casey's. My version of heaven. 

The food is good and the beer is even better, but what people really go for is the ambiance. The most awesome potpourri of people. Old, young, but always interesting.

Say hi to Thomas the cat for me! He's chilling with the patrons when ever it's not too crowded.",1
Definitely one of the best barbers on the westside of town. Ely takes his time and makes sure you are satisfied. I have tried a few different barbers around town and this is the best spot by far! I recommend this spot if you're looking for a great and friendly barber!,1
"Okay... just let me say, these guys are the best! My family and I stayed in Scottsdale for 5 weeks this past summer and we frequented Baskin Robbins almost every single night. No kidding. And, yes, my butt thanks me not for such goings on. But at any rate, we have never met such a friendly ice cream staff. I am a PITA when it comes to ordering my ice cream -- I like jamoca ice cream with almonds mixed in, then I like my fudge on the side and I like extra fudge. This sort of ice cream order has raised a few brows, and furrowed some in the past, but not here, not these guys! And the couple of times, my rice-high (from the sushi place next door) son dropped his cone on the floor, they were so kind and understanding about it, they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream they've had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers, and made him a fresh new cone, adding extra sprinkles, for good measure. Viola! No more tears and only big smiles from that moment on. They really are the best! I can't wait to visit them again! :)",1
"Always a healthy, fresh meal. One of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizer(which is gynormous) and I have them add in some tabbouleh, then cucumbers on the side. Perfection. All the pitas, and the seasonal specials are always super good. Wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes. Otherwise, great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting. There is something for everyone here, veggies, kids, etc. If I ever moved from AZ, this is the first place I would come visit upon my return. Parking can get hairy at the Arcadia location, and one time someone actually backed into my car when I was legally parked along a curb but that is hardly Pita Jungle's fault. The douche didn't even leave a note - but I digress and karma is real and nothing would keep me from coming back to Pita!",1
"I went to Tuck last night because of the reviews on here, and I loved it.  It really is tucked away and all the better.  It feels even more special.  We had the panini bites, dates stuffed with chorizo, and the citrus brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles.  Not your greasy comfort food here.  Everything was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try more.",1
"Great Pizza. Great Service.

We've been here a few times since it opened. And always look forward to going. We have never had a bad experience. Each time has been great. Our waiter Dave was perfect, always on the ball.",1
"Ok here is the deal, I am sad to only give ground control 2 stars because it should be way better. This is in walking distance to my house and I come here almost every day. I have coffee, muffins, salads,and so on.
The coffee is usually good, the muffin was great, the salad was so so bad, and the service is kinda strange. 
   Its a small area you would expect this place to be really friendly and helpful, not the case. They usually are busy talking to the other workers or have some small project going on, never are they happy you are there its almost like they are bothered by you. the salad i had there was really bad, the lettuce was wilted and slathered in dressing, I sent it back and it looks like the ""chef"" just put it on a new plate with a little fresher lettuce and a lot more dressing. wasted my $7.00 bucks. Please Please Please Ground Control get your act together so I can give you more stars.",0
"I went for lunch on a weekend recently.
Kimchi pancakes, spicy pork bbq lunch special.

The seasoning on the pork bbq wasn't what it used to be.
It seems like the texture is dried out and the flavor is bland.
The sauce is probably watered down.
It lost the yummy sauce/ flavor/ seasoning it used to have.

The kimchi pancakes weren't that great either.

I used to be so loyal to this place but after being let down the past couple times,
I think I might as well just cook at home (and deal with the dishes later)",0
"I work right down the street from Press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit! The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft! Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate! They always accommodate my special requests (a little more of this, none of that) and always make good suggestions when I'm looking for something new.
 I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte. Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling. For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad.
 Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around. They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee. I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!
  My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts! The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you've won the lottery. And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.
  Starbucks is a thing of the past. I'm lucky to be in close proximity to Press, but I think I would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake!",1
"It is almost impossible to find a great sandwich shop that actually has good grinders and sandwiches.  Well my search is over.  I stumbled across this little shop and felt right at home in New England.  Being from Connecticut, I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu.  I had the Vermonter and it was bliss at every bite.  The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell that they want you to be very happy with their food and service.  Great food and great service, you will not be dissapointed....",1
"My new favorite Mexican place in Tempe. Love their tacos. Their menu only lists them individually, but feel free to mix and match. I usually go with one camarone and one pescado. The shrimp are small, but there are lots of 'em. And the chunks of fried fish are bigger than the taco itself. Portions are generous - I'd have to skip breakfast to be able to finish more than two. Service is friendly and efficient - easy to get in and out during your lunch hour. Also a great spot for happy hour.",1
"We were in Phoenix just yesterday and stopped by Roberto's for a third time. We've yet to be disappointed!  My husband loves the breakfast burritos, which he gets with one of the soft sided (el pastor) tacos.  Being no fool, I go straight for the el pastor chimi (solo, not the platter)!  It's a good thing we don't live any closer, we'd be weekly regulars and I don't think I could swim that many laps to make up for it!  On our first trip I had the chicken chimi, and could not believe how tender the meat was, absolutely delicious. Then I discovered the el pastor...au revoir chicken (as good as it was!).  I don't know what kind of marinate they use, but we love the flavor and tenderness it brings to the pork. Yes it's in a gas station, but we've always found it to be clean and the food is always fresh.  We arrived around 11:30 yesterday and got there just in time to beat a steady stream of regulars stopping in for lunch.",1
"Dear Weather & Coffee,

I'm really sorry you had to close.  We had a lot of good times together.  Every time I came in, you always seemed really happy to see me... even though you knew me by the wrong name.  

I may be Kelly to everyone else, but I'll always be Aubrey to you.",1
Waitress/ bartenders are cute. We didnt eat. We just got a drink and left. Only like 5 beers on tap but no worries. They even gave one of my friends a band-aid lol. Their mix drink prices are a bit outrageous tho.. 3 beers for 10 or so.. 15 alone for a double of jack and coke.,1
"Huge portions of delicious pulled pork, perfect coleslaw, ice cold drinks, plenty of TVs, and friendly staff make this a fun place you should try!  Ohhhh yeah, be sure to use the Yelp check in deal for a free desert!  We went with the Death by Chocolate!  It is built for two and ohhh so delicious! 

However, I am only going with three stars due to limited BBQ meat selection compared to the others in town, limited cramped parking, and dirty paper menus.",0
"This is my favorite spot, waterfalls everywhere, beautiful flowers, fun slide, and great food!",1
"Bevmo is very close to my house so I am here on a regular basis. I recentley found out Total Wine is opening and now Bevmo will price match their prices only. 

My boyfriend has asked for them to put the Fosters Premium Cans in the Fridge and they said it was a corporate decision. They still haven't put them in the fridge. 

The store is clean and the employees are helpful and friendly.",1
"I have never actually been to a pawn shop for any reason. I can't honestly even tell you what they are used for. I have never seen Pawn Stars. I don't watch television. 

I really enjoy this signage. On an almost daily basis. Savy, that is all it is. Love of a little morning chuckle.",0
"This place is old school.  i.e. you don't come here for the service, or the ambiance (especially since it's in a scary part of town).  You come for the food.  Come with a group of friends, whether for dim sum or a late night dinner.  You need a group of people, I hate coming here when its just mean and three others.  I like to taste and sample lots of goodies.  They have great live seafood (a must in my book) where you can walk by and see what looks good that day.  Be brave and check it out!",1
"well everyone there is pretty nice i got gel tips from them and i do beat them up pretty bad at work and they are holding up as they should. they were reasonably priced. There is one Asian lady i like a lot i forgot her name though my fault. I also got a pedicure from them as well they did good.

PROS:
* inexpensive 
* good color selection
* nice people
*television available

CONS:
*Some of my tips are longer than others
*When i got a pedicure the water was so hot it burned me feet and they came out of the water looking like cherry tomatoes
*whenever i seem to give them the tip off my visa they seem almost disappointed since its not cash (i dont carry cash and im not starting anytime soon)
*the language barrier but its no one's fault
*the massaging pedi chairs are made for people taller than me *sigh*

Since the cons outweigh the pros it gets 3 stars but you are still getting really good service considering how much you pay for it and i will continue to give them my business because the lady who gave me the pedicure was really nice and she did a really good job getting rid of my callouses and didnt torture me too bad (im extremely ticklish).",0
"I'm not a big drinker, but this place is pretty sweet if you are. Huge selection at excellent prices.",1
You can't give anything less than 5 stars to a place that sells bra's and panties to hot chicks.,1
"This place not recommend, food was cold, rice was soggy, lettuce wilted, and beans runny.",0
"Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(

The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.

I'll pass.",0
"As a fairly new connoisseur of Greek food, this place is pretty good. I like their pita a lot, and the fire feta is quite addicting.  The salad and rice aren't anything to write home about, and I'm not crazy about the tzaziki sauce here (love it other places)... the street gyros were decent, and the tea that they serve here is delicious when mixed with pink lemonade. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but I'll be back when I'm in the 'hood.",0
"This place has amazing pizza and great service. I've been 3 times and have not been disappointed. We've come for mostly group events such as bdays and going away parties, and you can do family style and share or get individual portions. Bruschetta and breadsticks are great starters, and I love the signature spinach pizza. Our waitress suggested getting it crispy to avoid getting soggy spinach and I'm glad I took the suggestion! Coworkers got Chicago style calzone with au jus and raved about it. Since there was a bday they comped a canoli and gave us an extra one for being cool :) pitchers are also half off on Thursday's so 7 bucks for 4+ glasses worth of fat tire made us all extremely happy!",1
"Super cheap and good! I loved how large the portions were, the squid salad came in a large bowl and was delicious. We will definitely be returning.",1
"Yume Sushi Grill is a great spot! All of the sushi is very fresh, and they pride themselves in having great quality. The sushi chefs are knowledgeable in their craft, and also extremely friendly to have a chat with. They serve free salad and miso soup, and the serving staff is friendly, helpful, and attentive.

The Korean dishes are pretty authentic, and the home made kimchi is great! I recommend the bulgogi, bi bim bab, and spicy pork for meals. Lunch time is the best time to go, as their lunch specials are amazingly priced for the amount of food that you receive. 

The one complaint that I have is that they don't stock a few of my favorite kinds of sushi (although I know they aren't the most popular) mackerel, quail eggs, and surf clam won't be found on the menu.",1
"You can get drunk and get your nails painted.  Huh?

It's true, and it happens on Mondays.  For $10, you choose any martini you want.  Then, you drink and chat until it's your turn to get your hands worked on.

The chocolate martini I ordered was strong and smooth.  Definitely not watered down...just what the doctor ordered.  

Okay, so the manicure wasn't something you might get at a spa, but it was a fun little silly girly thing, that I personally think is a great idea.  Still, for the price of just the martini alone, you get shiney new nails.  Not a bad deal.

The people watching is quite interesting as well, I even struck up a conversation with a humorous dad of a popular comedian.

Bring the girls and have some fun.",1
"Bleh! 

I've heard good things about this place from my sister's friends (notice, I didn't say ""my"" friends) and I've always been curious.  Errand days are kinda ho-hum anyway, so I was excited to finally check this place out.  The reason I order a doughnut that is stripped off glaze and topping is that I'd  like to taste the actual product. 

Two doughnuts for my little guy and me for $1.60.  As the girl handed me the paper bag I was extra careful handling it for nothing.  Cold doughnuts?  Am I just so used to piping hot beignets?    Right off the first bite, I could feel the cheap hydrogenated oils coating the roof of my mouth.  Then the second bite, the feeling is now in my throat.  Eeek!  I asked my son what he thought.  ""It's okay,""  he stared at the doughnut and looked up at me.  I grab his doughnut and along with mine threw both in the paper bag it came with and chucked it.   Honestly, it would have been better to fry these sinful things in lard.  There is something about chemically laden food that I despise most!

Would I give it a second chance?  Not until they change their frying oil!

Sorry, Bosa.  One star is for the nice service and the other star is for being a local chain.",0
"Not many places that you can go and get a natural casing charred white hot dog outside of western NY.
Folks I know from Western NY love this place, and I have to agree (even though I'll still take a good Chicago dog any day).
I know where I'll be going if I ever have an itch for a white hot. :)",1
"The slices of pizza are cheap, huge, and very very good.  I really don't have to say anymore.",1
"Always reliably good.  Great beer selection as well as fabulous ""bitch fizz"" (ciders, etc.) and cocktails.  Their pizza is outstanding AND they have a healthy menu.  I generally steer clear of chains but this is an exception.",1
"Dumplings, Chicken fried steak with gravy. What more can you ask for. The satff was friendly and fast, Cant wait to try it again.",1
"Yum! Delicious tasting pizza, a wonderful atmosphere, and oh those  Nutella crepes are devine!",1
Excellent macaroons!  Great owners very conversant with their costumers.,1
"I found this place by accident. Blink and you'll miss it. Best fried catfish I've had. Totally not greasy. Thin cornmeal batter is the right amount of crispy. Fish is tender and moist inside without being greasy at all. Coleslaw was pretty decent. Cornbread was soft and had a hint of sweetness but not too much. Portions are good. Vegetarian options for the non-meat eater. I ate well for less than $10, tip included. Glad I found it.",1
"I have been to this place twice so far.  The first time I had no idea what to expect since I never heard of it before.  I honestly have no idea what to compare it to but I guess the closest thing is Texas Road House judging by the reviews here on Yelp.  Anyway, I know its not the classiest joint with the best food, but anything is worth a fair shot.  The first time my wife and I went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner.  We didn't expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded.

The happy hour is pretty good.  $3 pints and 2 for 1 cocktails/wine.  Both times we went we ordered a 2 for 1 drink which would have been ok if they didn't charge too much for the first one.  I mean $5 for a small glass of Yellow Tail?  They are giving you 2 though so I can't complain too much I guess.

The thing we love about this place is the 2 meals for $13.99 special they have going on.  There are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff.  So far we have had the chop steak, steak and the salmon.  They are all very good and decently sized.  They prepare them however you want (sauce on the side, etc.) and everything comes with 2 sides.  There are 10 or so sides to choose from.  I get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat I am having and they are always very good.  My wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well. 

The service is very fast and friendly and the food always comes out pretty quick.  Oh yeah, and I also am a fan of their peanuts as well as the rolls that you get to start.",1
"So, I'll admit that I'm a ***bertos addict...I truly crave this food and I'm not really sure why.  My mom says that she ate nachos w/ jalepenos on a regular basis while pregnant with me.  Maybe that explains it.  Anyway, I've been wanting to try this place forever since they claim to have ""the best tortillas in town.""  I seized the opportunity to check it out since I had to drop a friend off at the airport this morning.   

The exterior certainly leaves a lot to be desired, and the ambiance is about on par with the drunk tank at the fourth avenue jail (a good friend spent a most unfortunate night here and described it in detail).  The cold, stained cement floors, nasty old booths and 70's McDonald's style swivel plastic chairs which likely  needed a new coat of paint back in the early 80's.  I decided on a green chile burrito and my companion ordered the egg/chorizo/potato/cheese burrito.  After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, our number was called.  The first thing I noticed was that the burritos were quite small.   I knew, however, that I was in for a real treat with the piping hot, super chewy freshly made tortilla, and I was not disappointed.  The green chile, while tasty, had too much liquid and after inadvertantly puncturing my tortilla, I was left with a handful of sauce.  

I certainly felt more than safe inside this place (despite the somewhat scary clientele) based on the table of twelve Phoenix police officers sitting across from us.  Overall, I would give the atmosphere 1.5 stars, and the food 3.75 stars.   It was definitely different than what I'm used to, and it gave me a small taste of the cultural melting pot known as South Phoenix.",0
"Have only been here once before under too stressful of circumstances to remember, this trip to Olive and Ivy was fantastic. 

Usually going to lunch in Scottsdale is hit or miss with expectations, however today we had a lunch meeting scheduled for 11:30, I got a front row parking spot in front of the valet and had no problem being seated right away.

Sticking to my lunch salad trend, I ordered the Curry Salad with Chicken and couldn't have asked for a more perfect dish on such a warm day. The portions were great, the lettuce cool and crisp and even the ""handmade"" bread and pesto before complimented everything perfectly. 

The only gripe I would have, understanding it is a Fox Restaurant, was how almost unnatural the wait staff was with how rehearsed and methodical all interactions were. Even down to the correct usage of ""I am well"" versus ""I am good"" seemed a bit out of place, but not a big deal.",1
"This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.

Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome.",1
"Thanks to Fry's, I felt like I was on vacation today as I traipsed around in the rainforest with the Aztec computer geeks.  There's something just cool about walking into a snake's maw to listen to stereo equipment.  The outside is just as lovely to look at.

Now as far as the store itself...

...the cafe was a joke - out of cream cheese for their bagels.  Who runs out of cream cheese by 10am on a Saturday?  Coffee machine broken...don't they sell those things?  Couldn't they just 'demo' one from off the shelf?

...it felt like at least half of the workers knew what they were talking about - which is actually (maybe even sadly) better than some electronics stores I've been to.  They didn't try to talk down to me because I was young or a girl.

...prices were cheaper for some of the items I looked at

...no restocking fee for returned electronics.

So in the end, the unique look of the store boosted it up to a four, silly enough as that sounds.  It was refreshing to be in there, and my bullsh*t radar didn't go off as loudly as it did when I was in the Baseline location.  Good thing I wasn't rating just the cafe, they would've gotten a two.",1
Festive with a deep beer list. Great set up if you like live bands delivering music from up on high while drinking micro brews. Lots of tv's and pretty good selection of Az brews.,1
"Ok, so I know that this private shooting club has had it's share of problems with membership and maintenance issues but I have to say, in the last 6 months, under the direction of a semi-new board of directors, the range facilities have been greatly improved. 
The members can enjoy shooting pistols or rifles pretty much all day every day uninterupted except when a scheduled match is on the club calendar located at www.phoenixrodandgun. This new fully updated calendar is really cutting down on the number of scheduling conflicts between match directors and members. Also, since aquiring new Range Staff, the number of complaints about other members or range employees has gone way down. I do have to say, the range which is located right in central phoenix is affordable, practical and overall a great shooting experience.",1
"For some reason, these people seem to think it's OK to price a tank top, that probably has less thread count than my thong and cost about 17cents of labor to make, at $50. 

They also seem to think that dressing up their mannequins like paraplegic color and pattern blind grandmas gives them business. Oh wait...it does! Because this is Tempe. And Tempe, as I can't over-repeat, is the devil.",0
Cant say enough good things about Sens. Excellent food and excellent service.,1
"This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.

We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.

We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.

The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.

While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.

So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.",0
"Kona grill is never a disappointment.  Sushi, the regular menu, the atmosphere.....  The staff is very friendly and the food is very good!  We like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing!  I highly recommend Kona Grill for consistently good food!",1
"I've never been to the former restaurant that was once housed in this quaint little building, so my first impressions may be a bit different from others.  I have always adored this house.  It's absolutely adorable and in such a good location.  I read over the weekend that the new restaurant here was opening, so we made a point to visit it sooner rather than later.

We chose to go right after work, so there were only a few other people in here.  I really like the setup with the bar in it's own little alcove and seating situated throughout the rest of the house.  We were greeted immediately after walking in and we sat in a table by the window.  While we perused the menus I couldn't help but tap my feet to the killer old school music they were rockin'.  I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat.

The food was very good.  The sourdough bread was super toasty, literally grilled to perfection.  There was a ton of cheese in the sandwich, but I don't remember which kinds.  The important thing is that it was really tasty.  My only complaint is that the cheese wasn't ooey gooey.  it was melty, but I could still make out the shape of the cheese.  In my book of grilled cheese greatness, it needs to be a little messier.  The sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose.  The chips were good and I ate them all up.  There was also a dill pickle, but I don't do dill pickles.

I definitely think that this is a killer new spot that will do very well.  I have no doubt that this ultra-hip but non-pretentious spot will quickly become a neighborhood favorite.",1
"Since I moved to AZ from Los Angeles I have been searching far and wide for a sushi place that met my high standards for great sushi. Sakana is hands down the best in town. The fish is fresh, the rolls are huge and nothing beats the .50 cent appetizers when you buy a beer! I recommend going on a weeknight, Friday and Saturday nights can fill up pretty quickly so you might have to wait.... but it's worth it.",1
"Let me preface this story with the fact that it was not my little guy who I had to take in. I am dog sitting my friend's dog. They are on vacation. Dr. Alber and his amazing staff were unbelievable. I called at 5:15. They got me in at 5:30. Dr. Alber spent 40 minutes with me. Explained everything to me thoroughly. Little Rusty just has allergies and an eye infection but it was making him miserable. Dr. Alber gave me a plan of attack to care for it. EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE. $70 out the door, RX in hand and a tube of eye drops. I am in awe. I will recommend this clinic to everyone I know. I just cannot say enough good things about these lovely people. THANK YOU PRESTIGE ANIMAL CLINIC. YOU ROCK!!!!!!! I will now be taking my own little guy there. You guys are now the only vet I will ever use.",1
"I really wanted to have a Birthday cake for Zoey's 4th Birthday and The Bone Appetit Bakery did not disappoint. 

With just 24 hour notice I was able to choose a bone shaped cake from one of 2 sizes, I chose the small (see pics) A very tasty Peanut Butter and Honey cake with cream cheese frosting. All natural human grade ingredients, no sugar, salt or additives, Zoey went nuts for it! 

I also purchased her a cute little party hat to wear for her birthday (see pics) they even sell invitations if you are planning a big doggy bash! ;-) 

Your dog would just Love it if you brought home a Birthday cake for them, or even some of the house made baked treats they sell here.

"I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.  
When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.

Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.  

And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!",0
"I expected better.

The ambiance is pleasant.  It's lit well and the furniture is very new.  The booth was comfortable.   The bar appears to be a little dark and moody, but in a sultry way.

We were there on the Sunday before Labor Day, around 7 PM and it wasn't busy at all.  Maybe 8 patrons besides us.  We were seated right away in a booth.  The waiter was very quick to take our order and explained the specials.  

For the appetizer we ordered the cheese, fruit and crackers.  They ""ran out"" of crackers and gave us toasted bread soaked in butter instead.  We asked if we could have dry bread instead.  They obliged.  There were 3 pieces of cheese, all of which were the same and brie.  Seriously, please diversify the cheese plate with more than 1 type of cheese.  And have crackers to go with it, since t's on the menu description.

My girlfriend and I both ordered a quarter chicken.  I had the true jerk sauce and she had the honey truffle sauce.  The chicken quality was on par with Boston Market or Costco, maybe even fattier.  We were seriously unimpressed.  The sauces were good, but definitely did not blow your socks off.

You get to choose two sides along with your chicken.  I had zucchini and whipped potatoes.  The whipped potatoes come with your choice of three ingredients from a list of 12 or so.  Horseradish, garlic and mesquite sour cream were my choices.  The potatoes were excellent, both zesty and filling.

Overall, I was unimpressed.  This place is like an upscale Boston Market where the chicken is lower quality and the only improvement is in the quality of the sides.  The sauces are good, but you can do much better.",0
"Yum. Only wish this place was closer to my side of town so I could eat there more often.  Babbo (doesn't this mean Santa in Italian?) is a neighborhood Italian food joint that gives you big, tasty portions of food for little prices.

My friend and I always go here with her fam when she's in town, and I always look forward to it. The menu is filled with tons of pastas and all the regular Italian fare you'd expect to find, but they also have some great, unexpected desserts.

They have this apple calzone that is so freaking good, but the only downside is that it takes forever to cook.  Order it while you're still eating your dinner so you won't be sitting there for another 30 minutes waiting on it. They also have a huge half baked cookie dessert kinda like the amazing one at Oregano's. And while it's not as good, it comes pretty close. The desserts are ginormous, so sharing is best.",1

"I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever. 

Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars? 

Ugh.",0
"Great food at reasonable prices in a good atmosphere. 

Our family has been regulars for over seven years at the W. Iron location. The food is fantastic, you can't beat it for breakfast and the lunch sandwiches are great. We've noticed a big difference in the staff since managment changed. Many of the new servers are not as attentive as they should be but the long time servers never disappoint. 

If you go on the weekend prepare to wait, sometimes up to an hour. On Sunday if you arrive before 9:30 the wait isn't that long.",1
What a place for brunch. $4 drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.,1
"Scary things to me:
Paris Hilton has a career. 
Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. 
My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim!
Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. 

Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, ""Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?"" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. 

Finally. I found it. And entered. 

Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here.
I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! 

I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off. 

Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!",1

"2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!  Hamburger with only tomato, cheese, and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce, when we specifically said no lettuce or onion. Allergic to onions and don't like shredded lettuce. Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again. Will not be back.",0
"FEZ... The two times that I went it was in the afternoon on the weekend. Both times, I was able to enjoy a great lunch with my sister and cousin and then again with my sister. The two dishes I liked were the FEZ burger and the Casa Blanca Chicken.  The berry shortcake was good, however the water from the strawberries sort of killed the whipped cream and the shortcake (biscuit) was very good.

Overall the environment during those times were peaceful and quiet. The staff offered advice on the menus. The price a little high for my wallet but I would definitely come back to splurge with great company in tow.",0
"Thanks fellow yelpers for brining us to Four Peaks!  My husband and I were stuck in Phoenix for the night and needed a place for dinner.  Ironically we ended up at Four Peaks (a Vikings bar) on our way back home to Minnesota.  

My husband loves beer (brews a ton of his own) and especially enjoyed the beer sampler. Trying 10 beers for around $9, yes please!  I don't really love beer so I had a cider and it was exactly what I needed.  For dinner I had the turkey burger with fries.  The turkey burger was standard but the fries were awesome.  I think it was the beer batter.  My husband go the carne adovada and he raved.  I think he may try to convince me to fly back to Phoenix just for that dish!

The atmosphere was also great.  It was very laid back and fun to be able to sit amongst the beer being made.  

I highly recommend Four Peaks whether you are a Phoenix native or otherwise!",1
Awesome atmosphere and a unique place to go. I ordered the habanero burger and it really lit me up. As I was nearly finished the waiter remembered it is supposed to come with a free glass of milk (which I didn't get).,1

This place is the kama sutra of flavor for your taste buds.",1
"My hubby and I have been fans of Roy's since our first time at the flagship location on Oahu . . . and we've watched him expand to the mainland. Our experience with the mainland Roy's have been hit and miss, but the Marriott Desert Ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park! We went at the tail end of Arizona Restaurant Week. We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our money's worth . . . but we didn't have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end.

We had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed. 

My hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roy's Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin' good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven.

Desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roy's we've been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake.

We also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . ""I know my wines . . . "" Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM!

It was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didn't give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roy's Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!",1
"The other day, had a lunch from there. 

No, didn't eat at the restraint, but we picked up a very sizable lunch for a family reunion. The lady that helped us was very gracious, and accommodating. I know, how can someone helping with take out be accommodating, because, my sister, being the wild and crazy type (and to accommodate her husband) ordered 12 Pasteles uncooked, just as raw as can be. Why, so he could freeze some for Thanksgiving. That's the Puerto Rican in him. A holiday is better when it reminds you of childhood. 

The food was excellent, the Ropa Viejo nice and tender. The Paradise Pork (I think that's what it was) was also very good. And didn't taste like a pig. (The only good part of a pig for me is the other food group: BACON!) 

And we all discovered deep fried plantains, excellante'. 

Dessert was rich, sensual, wonderful and sexy!",1
"This is one of the only places in Phoenix that carries legitimate book binding supplies like book cloth and all sorts of decorative binding papers (unlike the decorative kind for scrapbooking). I love that I can order online, and then they will call me when my order is ready and I can just head on down to Tempe to pick my stuff up.

While I haven't taken any of their classes, they look pretty awesome. I have had experiences with old letter press techniques, and this place offers classes in it. I think I'm going to have to sign up!",1
"I went to Wildflower looking for a lunch spot that had wifi. I arrived at 11:30, and noticed every table in the small place was full. It was my first time there, it seemed a lot like Paradise Bakery (which is a good thing), so I ordered, hoping a table would open up. Price was about the same as Paradise. By the time my food got there, no tables opened, so I got the food to go. I got home, opened the food, and much to my dismay, it was quite a bit worse than Paradise. Also, no delicious cookie. Next time I'll just drive up the street a couple miles.",0
"How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?  I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos.  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.  

The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.  They could double their prices and I would still come back!

I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to.",1
"I've been here three times now and have yet to have a bad meal, or walk away complaining. The food is consistent. The prices are fair. And the service is great. Nice hidden gem without stupid long waits at breakfast. Score!",1
"Hands down, the best pizza in the East Valley!!!! Tastes like I'm back in New York City, that's how good the pizza is! They do all sorts of combinations and toppings. Mmmm mmmm good. The hero sandwiches and wings are good too. Located in a strip mall next to AMC movie theaters, it's a great place to go before or after the movies. And they deliver, too. Much better quality than chain pizzerias.",1
"Update:   They now have Coors and Miller Lite on draft.  Yay!  They're a real bar again.  I don't know the drama, but apparently the management has been ""let go"" and the owner is now managing the place.",1
Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!,1
"I've been to this Pita Jungle a few times, about 3-4 and ordered carry-out once. Every single time my experience was great. Great service, great food, and great atmosphere. I've ate at the patio once during a rare cold winter night, and the waiter, without us even asking, put a heater right next to us. It was really nice and kept us warm while we ate our food. At times it gets busy, but the wait has never been too long and annoying. This place is great, and compared to other Pita Jungle's I've been to (the one on Shea, Tempe, and Downtown Phoenix) this Pita Jungle has to be the best. The ambiance is nice, and the decor is very welcoming. A big open room for the dinning space works well.",1
"In a word -- Blah.  It's a chain so I didn't expect much, and in this case my expectations were correct. I ordered the shrimp tacos were alright, but nothing to write home about.  My take is that the food is mediocre and overpriced.  Plus the service was sub-par; we waited over 15 minutes to get our drinks refilled and when we asked for separate checks the server grumbled about it.  Believe me, there is better, cheaper, and more authentic Mexican food in Arizona.",0
"Delightful experience! I came in with my 2 little ones alone. Jay was our waiter, and a very good one. He got the chefs to prepare their sunsine roll with orange and passionfruit dressing, because I am highly allergic to mango. He was very accomodating. I also had the seared tuna tataki, which was also excellent. My kids had miso soup and their fried rice; both were very good. I was very surprised that a strip mall sushi joint would be thay delicious. Thumbs up!!",1
"Not bad food, combined with so so service. I tried the firebird chicken pasta and i have had better at chilies. I also don't drink soda so i ordered a lemonaid and since it was made at the bar  (non-alcoholic) they were 4 bucks each. it sounds like im cheap but 4 dollars for some sugar, water, and lemon? then 4 dollars for a second one? ok. the place was nice and huge on the inside, if i was taking a client out i would go there for the appearance but for my son, wife, and myself i think next time ill pass.",0
"I love this Gelato! My favorite combination is the panna cotta with the mint chocolate chip. Weird but wonderful. I am rarely down this way, especially since I've moved, but I still fantasize about digging in to this deliciousness!  

I only ever had great service, and fantastic product here. So far it is the best Gelato I've had, although I hear Arlecchino's is pretty fantastic as well. I miss visiting Angel Sweet, I will have to go back soon.",1
Food is outstanding! Rebecca rocks!!!!!!,1
Always good food and good service. Best gyros around. I know I always get speedy service so I can eat my food and not be there for hours.,1
"I am in love with this place. Everything is delicious. I have been in a few times now and hands down the best thing there is the asian mushroom soup. The portion size is perfect for lunch. They offer a sampling of 3 soups with bread, which is perfect since I can't ever make up my mind. Last time was in Janet was serving roasted red pepper and sausage frittatas and bacon and egg soup both of which were excellent.",1
"If you have $6 burning a hole in your pocket, and would like a thimble full of ice cream, this is your place. They have a terrific selection of flavors, and you can sample as many as you want before choosing, not to mention they are part of a coffee shop too. Unfortunately, they charge you a thousand dollars for a scoop of it. I'd rather go to Mary Coyle and get a Banana Split for that price, or just save my money because the idea of paying $6 for a scoop of ice cream is absolutely a fool parting with his money.

Two stars because it actually was tasty.",0
"In a hurry in the Phoenix airport and saw Blue Burrito Grille. Ordered the Big Blue Burrito with pork. Unlike a previous reviewer, I got a LARGE burrito with plenty of fillings including some very tasty pork. The salsa was also very good. Their website says that the burritos come with chips and there was a huge bin of them on the counter but alas my burrito came sans chips... which I didn't notice until after I was on the airplane. A good place for a quick Mexican lunch but make sure you get the chips.",0
Great service got there when they opened and hardly anyone was there. Our server mike was really nice. Tried the margarita chicken and  I loved it. Tequila lime sauce was to die for. And the quesadillia was huuuuuge! Its a little pricey but hello your in scottsdale!,1
"Always packed on wing night, which can sometimes make for slow service, but that is to be expected. I love their wings, even if they are kind of small, but who can complain for $0.39? Pizza is good too. And the pizza cookie dessert, omg, druelz.",1
"I'm no regular here, but on occasion I get a craving for an Iced Mocha that tastes like chocolate milk. Tully's has that down. That's the only thing I've ever ordered here (I go elsewhere for my usual espresso needs), so I can't speak on the rest of their drinks. But, I don't imagine the rest of their drinks being bad; their Iced Mochas are very enjoyable.

The service can be spotty. There are a couple ladies that work there that are sweet and take good care of the customers. But I've also encountered a couple of employees that aren't friendly and/or are super slow. Whatever; Tully's isn't my usual haunt. But it's good for what it is: fast-food-coffee.",0
"Went for lunch again with my wife and SIL yesterday.  Was pretty disappointed and they are losing a Star each of the last two times.  We ordered four entrees --  A combo Nam Yeung Noodle salad (I forgot the Korean name), Pork Tonkatsu, Seafood Tofu Soup, and a dinner portion of Kalbi.  We got there at 2:00 pm and we were immediately told that they plan to close at 2:30 pm even though their lunch hours are until 3:00 PM -- WTF??  So we ordered quickly.  Within a minute the tonkatsu order came out and it was cold; probably premade or something, and the meat used was very, very thin (again) so it was very dry.  The Seafood tofu soup and buckwheat noodle salad were OK.  The order of kalbi came out last, but not on a sizzling, cast iron plate, so the onions on the bottom were raw and not ""grilled and caramelized"".  

Don't know what is going on here, but each time we go, it seems that they are slowly going downhill.  So we have decided to look for another restaurant option for Korean food in our area.

Sorry for this seemingly negative update, but I want all yelpers to know of my opinions and observations.  We used to be big fans of this place.",0
"We started our hike from the Central/7th Ave. entrance.  This is quite a hike initially.  You will be out of breath if you're not a cardio master.  I've been working out 5 days a week for the past 6 months and I was huffing and puffing a bit.  I felt like a chump because I was having a rough time at first, but after the initial hill, it's not bad.  

The views of Phoenix are beautiful, but like Dan E.'s review said......""Don't let the beautiful desert deceive you"" it is toasty up there even on a beautiful 85 degree day like yesterday.  Always bring water!",1
"Consistent.  Fresh Mint offers a very consistent product. 

This is a vegetarian restaurant with a Kosher designationl. The menu is Asian, with traditional dishes served with tofu or just veggies.  The tofu is flavored/shaped as with it's more traditional dish (i.e. Kung Poa has chicken-flavored tofu, Beef dishes taste more like beef).  Personally, I prefer plain tofu over flavored and they will substitute to your taste.  Also, for GF'ers, they do have some dishes that are GF (no soy sauce--such as curries).  No upcharges for any subs or even brown rice...

At lunch, hardly a seat is available. It's nice to see that this is more crowded than the fast food joint that is closer to the street.  A slight tention can be felt for the business of the staff; however, this restaurant is consistant every time...it's worth trying folks.",1
I love sakana. They have the best lunch time happy hour! Its always delicious and seriously reasonably priced. :),1
"This place has amazing frozen yogurt! I had the strawberry with small pieces of fresh strawberries! It was a wonderful treat in this heat, since it's yogurt and not ice cream, it's a little bit healthier.",1
"I saw their ad in the College Times and decided to check it out. Had a coupon for free earrings (little stud dice ones) and I lost it; they still gave them to me anyways since they knew I was legit :) Stormy the co-owner is really nice. Lots of cool bargains to choose from; some really nice stuff I had to pass up since I am on a budget :) I did in-store trading too and got around $24 worth of store credit, which I used all at once. Overall a fun hunt. It's also a small little place so not too hard to get lost. :)",1
"I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes location in well over 3 years. I have never been to this location before, but the service was good. The selections haven't changed that much. I was pleased to see they had strawberry muffins with strawberry butter. YUMMY! The salads are still fresh and good.
I wish they had more non dairy alternatives there.",0
"All I'm saying is they need to do a better job at hiring their staff. The girl that helped us out last time was on something pretty heavy. It was a school night, and we had just finished up dinner next door at Windsor. We all wanted to get something sweet, but the girl working there was so blitzed out of her mind on something. She was barely able to interact with us. Within the first 2 minutes she must have asked us 5 times how we were doing. She never once made eye contact.  I'm not exaggerating by saying she looked pretty filthy, and was really rude to boot. Maybe that's just how the poor girl is, but damn, you think they could do a better job hiring people to compliment the charm of a family oriented cutesy sweet spot. 

She turned us off so bad, that no one in the party decided to order anything.

I give it 3 stars because I've been before, and thought their stuff  was good, not great. Churn is pretty damn adorable & local, so they get extra love for that. So, for now, until something better comes along it will just have to do.",0
"The Parlor is one of my go to favorites when I'm craving pizza, going on a first date or have friends and family in town. 

I always have a serious conflict between the margarita pizza v. the pesto pizza. They are both sooo good. Lately I've been going for the margarita with a side of marinara side. Usually pair it with caesar salad.",1
"I recently tried OHSO. Nice layout and design... modern and casual. Their menu features cheese and charcuterie plates, flatbreads, burgers, and other comfort-style dishes. I had the grilled cheese with a cup of tomato soup. The tomato soup reminded me of pepperoni pizza, which was strange at first but actually pretty good. It was the perfect order for a chilly, rainy day. The 48th Street Fizz (orange vodka, pineapple, lemon, st. germaine, and beer) was sweet, but tasty (love cocktails with carbonation). They have an extensive list of local and regional beers. Overall, it's a nice little neighborhood spot.",1
"Never. Again. *hork* 

I have been to this location a couple of times. My friends LOVE this place, and I really wanted to at least like it. But here I sit typing out my review and fighting the urge to double over the trash can at my desk. I can't remember the last time I felt so sick! 

A few things about last night's dinner stand out...as negative. But I'll start with the positive, which bumped the review up from 1 star to 2. 

POSITIVE: 

Our waitress was very friendly and chipper. 

NEGATIVE: 

But alas, it was not enough. We ordered edamame, 4 rolls and a couple of sake bombers...um...but the ""shot glass"" was too big to fit in the glass...so that no worky. 

The waitress asked if we wanted everything to come at once or if she should bring them out as they were prepared...we chose the latter... 

1) we never got our edamame, 

2) it took 30 minutes before the first roll came out (with no wasabi or ginger??), the next 2 rolls took an additional 30 minutes, and the 4th roll was about 5-10 minutes after that... 

3) the spicy yellowtail (roll #3) had obviously turned, it smelled like bad fish, which I unfortunately didn't realize until it had already made it's way into my mouth...I felt instantly sick and haven't been right since then, which means I didn't even get to enjoy a taste of the 4th roll because I didn't trust it anymore. 

POSITIVE: 

She took the yellowtail off our bill...which seems like it would be a no-brainer, but you never know these days. 

NEGATIVE: 

No apology for serving us bad fish, and no acknowledgment from the mgr on duty, which should be standard operating procedure at a restaurant. 

Also, the acoustics are not conducive to having any sort of conversation. The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. 

And finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid... 

POSITIVE: 

For the moment, I'm still alive (which feels like a negative right now, but I'm hoping that this current wave of nausea will be the last).",0
"The Arizona Science Center offers a series of programs called adult's night out  which are held the first Friday of every month. These lectures cover focused overviews on topics ranging from Genetics and Nanotechnology to Native American medicinal utilization of native plants found in the Southwest. 

There is always interesting science or engineering content but the value and interest of the talks is essentially the somewhat direct non-mass-media poisoned or dumbed down views of the individual speakers themselves. While I would attend the talks regardless I have found additional value in the evening because of the extended hours that the science center offers which allows you to catch an IMAX film and see the latest flavor of exhibit (Body Worlds, Titanic, etc.) after the lecture. 

I would have loved to have given the Science Center 4 stars but I am constantly annoyed by the science center's staff inability to get one of the three microphones set up correct for the speakers ahead of time causing a speaker to waste 5-10 minutes every month.

Beer and wine are available for purchase during the event. The adult's night out lectures are free, normal planetarium, IMAX, and special exhibit prices still apply.

"Fabulous place to get wine, beer, spirits.  It also has amazing keg selection.",1
"This hotel is in a good location for getting to the sports venues downtown, the convention center or to just be in the heart of the city. Granted, it is about a 7 block walk to most of those places, but the lower price and FREE parking definitely make it worthwhile. I usually stay in Scottsdale when i am here for spring training, but I was here for a conference and walked to the convention center each day with no problems. It made sense to be downtown instead of Scottsdale. The hotel is clean, the rooms are nice and big and the free breakfast is decent. I did not visit the pool, so I cannot comment on it. Someone mentioned the area being shady, i walked to and from here at least twice a day including late night and never felt it was a bad area. Also, the review about passing cars was not an issue for me. I was on the street side and I'm a light sleeper. Maybe their window was open?  i do agree that you can hear your neighbors in the bathroom, slightly annoying. In, summary - this hotel is a great choice and if the need arises, I'd stay again.",1
"I used to work near here and we got take out a lot. 

My favorites: spinach enchiladas, green corn tamale, chicken mini chimis ( they come with a green chile cream cheese dip, OMG). 

I loved their tex mex spin, not authentic Mexican, mind you, but tasty. 

I can't speak to the service, I rarely went in to pick up, even... I'm one of those crafty people who can get others to do that, lol. 

I liked it though.",1
Good food at a good price.,1
"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the food, or the view? I know, I'll share the best part about my amazing birthday dinner at Elements -- meeting Executive Chef Beau Macmillian. 

He didn't duck away when we made eye contact in the hallway, instead he broke away from his staff and came right up and introduced himself. He was so incredibly personable. He could have easily ignored us. I'm sure he's approached on a regular basis now that he's such a TV personality. But instead, he chatted us up and he talked about how he was so inspired by Asian food and how he wanted to bring that influence into his food and to Arizona. Before we knew it he was taking us in to see the latest renovations to Elements' kitchen! 

He proudly showed off the latest upgrades. Sure, there were new gadgets, but he even included skylights because his sous chefs said they hated never seeing the light of day. How cool is that?

And to be revealed next month is an expansion to the kitchen that includes a table for 12 INSIDE the kitchen. Not a new concept for restaurants, but something Chef Macmillian is so excited about. There's no doubt that the food that he cranks out can be intimidating, but his latest endeavor speaks to his desire of having his guests witness the artistry behind the kitchen doors. This new addition promises to give you a full sensory experience BEFORE the plate even reaches your table -  from seeing, smelling and hearing what's happening in the kitchen to finally tasting the finished product. Talk about mouth watering.    

Here's hoping that I will one day get to sit at that table.",1
"Wow, it must be a first-time mall experience for the reviewer before me.  Five stars for Arrowhead?  Are you kidding?

I find this mall to be average and boring with many middle of the road stores (Dillards, Sears, Gap, Tilly's, Forever 21) you can find elsewhere at other Westcor malls in the Valley.   

Nothing really strikes me as distinctive at this mall - other than the fact that it's the nicer of two indoor shopping malls on the Westside.  So for 500,000 people this is the only game in town unless they're willing to drive east.

The store mix and food court are pretty typical.  In fact, I rarely go here unless I am in the area, need socks or undershirts and/or I'm trying to avoid the lines of the other Arrowhead Paradise Bakery.",0
"Last night (Friday night) was the first time I had been back to Myst in years. The club is nice, but the promoter for Friday nights is urban... and not classy urban... like kinda hood urban.... BUT I must say that it's a fairly mixed crowd. Black... White... Hispanic... I was surprised to see all different types of hood folks out. Now, this usually wouldn't have been my crowd of choice, but my girlfriend and I were feeling adventurous. 

Long story short, the bartender was awesome and the wait for drinks wasn't too bad. They averaged about $10/cocktail. The cover was $15 and $35 for VIP (which allows you access to upstairs... not worth it. It's a recession and the dance floor is downstairs...) I'm not sure who the DJ was but he was really good. It was like all the best of Gucci Mane and all that Southern type club music... very good stuff. 

I gave a rating of 3 stars b/c while this isn't a place many of my friends would want to go to in the future on this particular night, it was a decent night IF this is the crowd you're looking for. Hey folks... I don't judge lol...",0
"What an awesome sushi place! I highly recommend How do You roll, if you want some sushi done quickly and freshly and without wait. what a novel idea. I want to thank the manager Amanda for taking good care of me, can't wait to come back again!",1
"Seriously soo good! Drove 60miles to come here about 5 times in the 3 months that I lived in AZ. 

I came here because of the triple D episode and it was soo worth it! Burgers, fries, onion rings, sweet potatoe fries and pizza are ALL GOOD! 
and check out their bathrooms.. its pretty cool too. 

Tried Joe's Real BBQ, which is their first restaurant but it was just OK. 
Joe's Farm grill is def. one of my fav places..",1
"Upon our overnight stay at Econolodge a few blocks down, the live lit sign along side of the street attracted me to try this restaurant.  I remember the menu vaguely, however did not forget the amazing breakfast special the other half and I ordered.  $6 for a plate of thick cut bacon, 2 eggs made your way, hash browns, and toast (white/wheat/rye, etc.)  Customer service was great, the hostess and waitress made us feel very comfortable!",1
"I do enjoy this coffee shop, though admittedly it has largely subscribed to bohemian bloodletting since emerging from the former Willo House. They still present photographs, paintings, sculptures and more throughout the cafe, most, if not all, for sale. The clientele has changed, as has the interior. Regardless, it's still a nice place for coffee. For those who haven't been, it's set in an old house on the southeast corner of 3rd Avenue and McDowell. Personally, one of my favorite activities is to start here for coffee and take a walking tour in the area. It's one of the few neighborhoods in Phoenix with historic homes from the 1920s, which seem to be untouched by the authoritarian overlords of homeowner's associations so popular in suburbs. I could be wrong, as I don't live in the area. But, to stay on topic, the menu is a bit pricey but Hob Nob's has retained the Willo House's cozy, neighborly feel, though yes, over a few short years it transitioned from hippie to yuppie.",1
"I love this arena...maybe I am biased since I am a diehard Suns fan and a downtown resident, but it really is a nice facility.  The Suns games are always well put together...great announcer, great dancers, great entertainment, and great concessions.

I attended the last game of the season in a suite Wednesday night and was impressed with the space and the food...actually quite good!",1
"I Love Lolo's Chicken and Waffles and you will too! 

Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolo's. I had heard about Lolo's and Mrs. White's for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations. When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food. 

The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent ""Forget about it"". But don't forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try. The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid. Yes I said Kool Aid. I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID. Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968. 

This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it. This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly. When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie. He did the song ""Just a Friend"" back in 1990.  

The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like. 

BOTTOM LINE, I LEFT FULL, HAPPY AND WITH A KOOL AID SMILE. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT",1
"This could possibly be 5 stars. Driving by you would never know this restaurant serves excellent Italian food. It is rather small and has a very different decor from other Scottsdale restaurants. I went on a Friday night and there were not many people there and I have walked by on other weekend nights and it was the same result. 

Regardless of that the food was outstanding. I ordered a special, lobster risotto and it was superb. There are many other things on the menu which I would like to try as well. It is rather expensive, but well worth it. The service was also very quick, and it should be when there are not many people dining.",1
"My daughter began taking classes at Encore 6 years ago.  At the time she had a bit of an attitude and didn't do too well with other girls.  She instantly fell in love with Regina and took numerous classes from hip hop (her first choice) to ballet, jazz, and lyrical.  I watched my daughter blossom into an amazing young woman as well as an amazing dancer.  Regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem.  My daughter has had the opportunity to travel to California and Las Vegas with the studio to participate in Nationals and Master Classes.  Encore is not JUST family owned, it is a family environment.  I checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants.  I couldn't recommend anything more than Encore and the skills that your child learns.  My daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now.  I am looking forward to another 6 years or more with the Encore family.",1
"I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest.",0
"This is was, WAY out of the way for me. But when I heard about That's Amore, I just had to try it. What can I say, I love gelato! Anyway, one afternoon I talked the kids into a Sunday drive with cool gelato as the reward.

While That's Amore gelateria is located in a strip mall (what in Arizona isn't?), the taste and style are pure Italian. Credit the fact that it is owned and operated by two sisters and their husbands who emigrated to Scottsdale from Italy. The murals of Italian cities on the back wall were even painted by their father, who they brought to the valley for just that purpose. How cool is that? It might not make the gelato taste better, but it almost made a ride to Pinnacle Peak feel like a trip to Napoli instead.",1
"Rokerij is worth the hype. We popped in last week for a late bite and left super happy. We scored a few seats at the bar, the place was SUPER crowded (which is a good sign on a Wednesday). I started with a beer called Banana Bread, which was awesome. Wifey had a glass of wine, but I can't remember what it was. We couldn't decide on what we wnated so we ended up splitting the entree of Blackened Salmon with Apple/Chipotle chutney and some potatoes. We also got three of the small Plates: mini reuben, crispy calamari and cilantro rubbed grilled shrimp. All the food was awesome. The salmon was cooked perfectly, although i think I would have liked the chutney on the side, but that's small fries. The calamari was cooked perfectly, the shrimp were awesome (although the bed of rice it came on was meh), and the mini reubens were great as well. I was super excited to try it, and it delivered. Can't wait to go back!",1
"Went there for two games back to back days. The first was a night game and they had the roof open. The temp. inside was great and made for a real enjoyable evening. During the game was able to watch a 747 fly overhead, very surreal. 

During the day game they had the roof closed to keep the AZ sun and heat out. I personally thought it was a little warm inside even though they announced it was about 74 degrees, not sure if that was accurate or not. I know AZ spend loads of money on the AC, but I wasn't impressed.

Overall the place is nice and all the amenities are very close by. I had sections 112 and 109 and both offered great views of the field and visitors bullpen. The service at the concession stands is great and the lines move by pretty quickly. 

Still not the #1 stadium in the MLB.",1
"I'm ashamed that I haven't left a review for this place yet. I've eaten here for a good while and I've never been disappointed with the food. Well, there was this one time, but it was because it was sold out. I'm okay with that, it tells me it was really popular that night. Anyway...

The prices are good, the teas are good, and it's just fun to sit in the pews while watching the candles melt. Every friend I've brought here has had a good time with an equally good meal. I'm a sucker for the royale with cheese and a side of thousand island.

You know what, look at the average review score. I really think that's the most telling part of this place. Really. Go. Eat. Enjoy.",1
We've been going here for years. Love the food (Happy Family is a favorite dish) and appreciate the community service outreach. Great to support locals who support the community ... and dish up great food along the way.,1
"I love Greek food, but I need to stop letting my friends drag me to this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and the place is comfortable, but for me the food is always a disappointment. I know I know, it's a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that I'm from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner.",0
"We held a meeting planner's luncheon inviting local clients to our hotel that host regular meetings.  Our theme was ""getting to the core of your meeting"" and the entire event had an apple theme.  Yuri's Popcorn created a special flavor green apple for our event and it was a nice compliment to our other offerings.  Our attendees absolutely loved it and were excited about all the creative and delicious offerings, including centerpieces with an arrangement of candies and popcorn beautifully arranged into a bouquet of yumminess.

Several months ago, we hosted a lemonade stand for a client serving glasses of flavored lemonade.  Yuri's created another fun flavor....lemon....that was well received by all.

They offer the perfect gifts for clients and everything is very affordable when you're on a tight budget.

Thank you!",1
"Monday Morning - take out

Room for improvement - 
- same curt, terse service
- too cramped to actually look around and appreciate their items for sale
- food was average, but not worth all the fuss this place requires.

+ I like the food for the most part and you can't go too wrong with a red velvet cupcake...can you?

This place is all fuss and hippity dippity so i surmise that is the situation with the crowds.    I am sure I will be dragged there again by another friend in that neigborhood so I will try to look with new eyes.

"This is my FAVORITE place to dine out in the greater Phoenix area. The food (I recommend the steaks) is almost as good as the view and the service is impeccable. My boyfriend took me here on a date a year ago, and it was definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have found in Phoenix yet. 

The prices are a little high ($25 - $40 per entree), but it's well worth it and you won't leave disappointed. If you like American or French food (who doesn't?) and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different, I highly recommend Different Pointe of View to everyone!",1
"I told myself not to buy clothes at Macy's since I did not have that much room in my carry-on luggage. Darn you Macy's!! Why did you have a bazillion racks of clothes that was on sale!!! NooOOo.. I could not resist the temptation and bought 4 shirts for $60. I wanted to buy more too!! 

I have a love-hate relationship with this Macy's.",1
"I am a harsh critic when it comes to Mexican Food.  My good buddy Paul talked me into coming to this place.  When I asked him what to expect, he was correct in saying: ""Don't worry dude, just get the green on green with a taco on the side and watch the hood life unfold.""  He was CORRECT!  This place is in the hood and they open at 10:30am for lunch.  The lines get long at about 11am.  They have a video game from the 80s while you wait. They serve drinks in THE CAN so I would suggest getting a 32oz thirstbuster beforehand.  If you go in the summer, you will be HOT in the summer heat as the only place to sit are at the picnic tables located OUTSIDE of course.  If you try to alter your order, you will be SCOWLED AT by the cashier.  However, if you treat her with respect, she will say something in spanish to the old heavy hispanic lady in the kitchen who stirs the chili and the fat lady will either NOD or shake her head.  All in all - a great place to eat!!",1
"These guys are great.  I had an old Craftsman mower, probably 8yo, that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years.  It coughed and wheezed, barely even turning over.  I brought it to them and now it works (and even looks) brand new!",1
"I see Jenny Strebe who cuts and Veronica Peebles who colors. They are AMAZING! I am so glad they opened Salon Stylush, it is the perfect size (not too huge and crazy) and it is so modern & cute! 

Jenny is an amazing hair stylist with the accolades to prove it (she styles hair for fashion shows, magazines, television, etc). Jenny has been cutting my hair for years and she is super sweet and super talented. I trust her with my hair, no question, and recommend her highly. Also, she has a talent for men's hair as well. She cuts my husband's hair and that is one of his best qualities (I'd say!). There are so many men out there with bad hair - Jenny knows how to make it work for men!

Veronica has colored my hair for years - and she is hands down one of the best in the industry. I never loved my color until I found Veronica. Now, I trust her completely and know she'll make my hair look great, and natural, which is important to me. She's also super sweet! I highly recommend Veronica as a stylist and colorist.",1
"I honestly wish I could give this place 0 stars just to keep people out of here- that's how much of a gem my bf and I think this place is. The not only have a more spacious theater, a bar, food beyond the typical nachos and sour patch kids (crappy, but it's there and basically just a bonus in my opinion) but they have 3 flavors of popcorn...3! Holy bajesus- we go for the Carmel popcorn alone. I don't even think we have had the regular or the cheese ever, maybe once. We go out of our way to go there just for that. This place is never that busy which I don't understand. Oh, and another plus, it's not the Tween's hangout on Friday nights. I will admit, we buy the living social or grouping every time we go there ($15 for 2 tix and 1 popcorn), but they already have our business.

You idiots who review a place after going to a highly publicized premier like the Hunger Games that you bought with a Groupon are just that...IDIOTS. No one wants to listen to your nitpicking, go to a useless site like Yahoo Local that no one reads so you don't have to make society dumber for listening to your complaining.",1
"When I say a certain food contains ingredients such as blue cheese and bacon, what comes to mind?
No, I'm not talking about a salad, I'm talking about an ice cream sundae!

Sweet Republic is an awesome little ice cream parlor located in a strip mall in Scottsdale, Arizona. This amazing place makes all their ice creams and sorbets in house. Sweet Republic makes some pretty creative flavors. These are just a few examples of what we sampled:

Basil Lime Sorbet
Salted Butter Caramel
Apple Pie
Dessert Honey
Maple Pecan
Almond Buttercrunch
Cashew Turtle

All of these flavors were wonderful but there was one more that really got me all hot and bothered, and that was their Honey Blue Cheese. That's right, Blue Cheese ice cream. When I first saw it, I did not know what to think but after my first lick I was hooked. It tasted just like a sweet vanilla / honey ice cream with blue cheese crumbles mixed into it. I know it sounds weird but this ice cream is phenomenal. It was sweet, tangy and somewhat salty, all at the same time. Instead of just enjoying this ice cream alone I decided to make my own blue cheese sundae. They have many toppings to choose from, including bacon brittle. When all was said and done my creation contained two scoops of their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream topped with a salted caramel sauce, bacon brittle and a homemade marshmallow that was toasted with a blow torch. This sundae was exploding with flavor. Every bite was crunchy, salty, sweet, tangy and delicious. 
My fiancé had a waffle cone sundae that contained Salted Butter Caramel ice cream, Almond Buttercrunch ice cream, salted caramel sauce, brownie bites and a homemade marshmallow. Hers was also amazing.

The service and prices here were both great. The girl working the night we visited allowed us to sample as many flavors as we wanted and was really friendly and patient with us. The prices here are similar to  Coldstone's. 

I'm absolutely in love with Sweet Republic and would seriously make a special trip to Scottsdale just to have their ice cream. I shouldn't be telling you all this, for fear that you all would think I'm a pig but I liked their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream so much that after I finished my sundae I ordered a Honey Blue Cheese milkshake to go. It was so yummy!",1
"The only thing I like about Fez are the pomegranate margaritas. 
Food could be better...",0
Amazing Mexican food and the drinks are knock you on your ass good.  Have the guacamole and a madre then come and talk to me.,1
"RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. It's not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that it's still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St.

The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street.

The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two.

There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup.

I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didn't overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected.

I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but I'm excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out.",1
"After stopping by Gallo Blanco for breakfast our second and last time, I have to wonder when the last time was that Doug Robson set foot in his establishment?  We have been going to Gallo Blanco since it opened on a regular basis and finally decided to try breakfast a couple of weeks ago.  We showed up about an hour after they opened, requested coffee and OJ, and were told that they had no OJ because ""no one worked last night, so no one made it.""  Uh, okay, what have you slackers been doing for the hour that you've been open this morning?  Fast forward to yesterday, when we decided to give it another go.  We showed up about 45 minutes after they opened, desperately wanting a Bloody Mary.  Guess what?  The bartender hadn't showed up yet...we were walking out to go elsewhere (we REALLY wanted a Bloody Mary--don't judge) when she did arrive and we popped over and ask if she could make them--then we would have sat back down and had breakfast.  Nope, she said, she needed 15 minutes to get set up.  It wasn't the 15 minute wait that made us leave--we had to drive somewhere else, after all--but her response sent us to the door.  F you, Gallo Blanco, for hiring a parade of unsupervised, couldn't-care-less-hipsters that are slowly ruining the excellent reputation Robson worked so hard to earn.",0
"We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in. I had the cream of leek soup, my mother had the sausage salad, and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed. We took a bangers and mash pasty to go, but we are so full, that it'll be awhile before we can try it. The service was a little slow, but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience.",1
"I LOVE THIS PLACE I JUST CAN'T NOT GET ENOUGH OF NCOUNTER!
the vibe is young clean and fresh. 
the good is so delish.. I keep telling all my friends to go here for brunch (:",1
"It's not that I don't like this place, it's just that it's very run of the mill. Bison Witches does the standard sports bar cum college drinking hole thing. That's all that can really be said about this place. You can't really hate this place for that because it is what it is. A milquetoast spot at its most average..",0
"Summary: not impressed.

Arrived early afternoon, ironically maybe that was the problem - there wasn't enough going on, place was dead. I would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a Friday night rush - standards are standards, you either have them or you don't.

Waitress was pleasant but not attentive - with a total of 3 occupied tables had to get up and get her attention for more chips. Chips though were very good; needed hotter salsa.

My friend had the steak fajitas; tasted OK but just luke warm. Fajitas are supposed to be sizzling hot; duh.

I had a so-so tamale and chicken enchilada. Enchilada was just warm, mostly a flat layer of cheese. Tamale filling was tasty shredded meat (as it should be) but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked. Refried beans weren't warm enough to even melt the grated cheese sprinkled on top, which consequently then pulled off in a single congealed mass when I took a bite. 

Finally, the Cadillac margaritas were just average at best. 

$50 plus tip for two meals plus two margaritas; not worth it.

The place looked promising and has a cute patio area but we won't be back - someone's not watching the store. I'm trying to be generous with the two stars as some other Yelpers seem to like this place; maybe things can get better.",0
"Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!

Here's how my experience went ... 

Me: ""May I have a Carmel Latte?"" 
Employee: ""No""
.... dead air ...
Me: ""Ummm why not?""
Employee: ""We don't have carmel""
Me: ""Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then""
Employee: ""Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino""
Me: ""Okay"" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).

So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).

This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.

Complete FAIL. 

For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees. 

And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.

---- 
please read ""owners comment"" below ... here's my response ... 
----
Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to ""promote good coffee in Arizona"" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ... 

By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!",0
"It's called ""Babeway"" for a reason people...


But I go here for the Deli, they have the best panini. I like to stop in for the 3 cheese panini with mustard and tomato. It's also a good choice to pair up with the Italian wedding soup.",1
"Anytime I locate a Subway with BOOTHS, I put it on my list to go!  Yeah booths!  Ok, so today after my haircut at (4 Star) Great Clips here in the center, I hopped on in here.  

The ""SUButopian"":

*  Staff a little drifty.  There was no soup on the menu sign, so I asked Mr. Drifty I, the cashier, what kinds they had today, & the price.  He said, ""We don't have soup here"".  Ok, so I asked him what was in the two kettles three feet behind him.  ""Oh.  I guess we DO have soup, but I don't know what it is, or how much.""

Miss Nondrifty appears out of nowhere, & I ask her about it.  She agrees with me that it's not on the menu, & says they have Vegetable Soup & Broccoli Cheese Soup.  Fine, but I'm a meatie!  (Ok, the Broccoli Cheese is good, but I at least wanted Chicken Noodle which almost all Subways have every day.)

After receiving my sandwich (& skipping the soup), I put my cup under the ice dispenser & it was empty!  I gripe & in a few minutes Mr. Drifty III appears & pours a bag of ice into the soda dispenser.  We're at 2 Stars right now, including a boost for the clean, comfortable cafe atmosphere & nice booth to sit in.

Ok, the good:

Backtracking to just after the no soup/soup/no soup minute, & placing my order...   The place is a little busy, but it's not too long a wait for Mr. Drifty II to go to work on my sandwich.  I order a ""Subway Melt"" which comes with ham, turkey, bacon, your choice of cheese, & whatever veggies you want on it.  

I get it on their Honey Oat bread, & have him not toast it, but just nuke the four long slices of raw bacon.  The bread gets a thin coating of mustard on one side & mayonnaise on the other.  For cheese, it gets Pepper Jack (of several good choices), then a little lettuce, lots of tomato, some onion, Greek Pepper slices, & a squirt of Ranch Dressing.

OMG, it was terrific!!  ...and the October Special is ANY foot long sub  (except 2) for only $5!

SO, while this Subway doesn't come up to the 5 Star one down the street at 5130 W. Baseline, the great sandwich & value propelled this one up to 4 Stars (& I didn't need the soup anyway)!     :-))",1

"I was so excited to find this place, less than a minute down the street from home! Because I'm not a big panda express fan, but I love Chinese food. Sadly, I was disappointed. 

The orange chicken was very stringy and tasteless. The sweet and sour sauce was runny and mostly sour. The wontons were the only decent thing we ate there. 

If you want good, cheap chinese avoid this place and try Li's Bowl on 35th ave.",0
"""Are you kidding me Laura?!?!""
""OMG we are going to get shot!!""
""Dude this is a fucking double wide.""

This is what I heard upon entering the parking lot. 

""Hell yes we are eating here I don't care what you say!!""

I like it no matter if Veronica R (my sister) did not like their green chili. Its a taco place order the tacos!! Yes the rice was overcooked and a bit crunchy hopefully its not like that all the time. The beans were FANTASTICO they tasted like the ones my Abuelita used to make. The salsa was not for the weak its nice and spicy just how I like it. I had the shrimp tacos as my entree see pics, they were delicious I cleaned my plate!!

Cheapest beer ever I had a Bohemia for $2.50 they are $6 anywhere else!! We also took some Horchata and a Mansanita glass bottle to go mmmm. This place was clean and reminded me of Mexico inside, if I am in the area I would not hesitate to stop in here for a bite.

Shout out to Danny S for recommending! TY!!",1
"Ask to sit outside, if you can! The patio is wide, clean, and fresh air goes great with a Grand Slam. Very kind manager working the day we called to see if we could bring our dog with us before we had to run off to her dog training. She said they don't normally allow pets out there, but since there was nobody outside, she would allow it unless someone complained. We got there, passed the pup over the gate, and had brinner like champs while watching the traffic. The manager came by to check on us and even brought out a bowl of water for Tatum. Like everyone says, it's Denny's food... what do you expect? But I think the hospitality makes all the difference.",1
"Going to keep this review short and to the point...

Service: Most of the time horrible. Typical waiting forever at the bar for a drink, if I can even get thru to the bar... Bartenders seem to be oblivious to serving patrons in a fair first-come-first serve fashion...Major dislike

Atmosphere: Trendy and hip. Except for the excessive desperate looking cougars trying to cash in on fake rich or really young ripped Jersey Shore looking guys. The cougars are just minor annoyances, they don't get in the way too much. The majority of the people seem to be pretty cool though.

Pricing: A little steep, but it's Scottsdale. The place could offer a better happy hour. Sunday's bottomless bubbles (champagne) is a great value. 

Food: Portions are pretty small, but are decently priced.

Decor: Outstanding! Job well-done in decorating and furnishing the place. It's really distinctive and luxurious. However, the rough plastic-feeling purple couches do not feel pleasant to the touch. They look like velvet, but are vinyl. Major fail on this! This requires immediate attention.

Patio: Great views and plenty of seating. However, hated how many stupid old smelly cigar smokers were out there clogging up the air. I'm not sure what can be done about these disgusting people, but overall the patio set up is one of the best around...",1
"Sacks is a great little place.  One issue and I know this wouldn't seem like a bad thing (at least if you are the owner) but it is a bit too busy for me.  I can never find a parking place or a seat.  The sandwiches are good and I like them, but I will admit that sometimes I don't go just because of the crowds.  

The food is good.  I like that they have a variety of sandwhiches and they put a lot of things on the sandwiches which can easily be taken off for the picky folks like me unlike other places where things are mixed in and not removable.  If you are looking for a good tastey sandwhich, this is a great place to check out.  If you are looking for a nice relaxing lunch where you can find a seat, move along.",0
"If it would be closer to my area, I could give it one more star. 

Their special of $4 burgers is a good way to call your attention. The best was the service, the lady that took care of us was really friendly and nice. Another time I'll have to try their food.",0
They are wonderful!,1
"I went to Khai Hoan yesterday and ordered the rare beef pho.  Now, this is the first time I have had pho before and I would say it is much like a glorified bowl of Ramen Noodles.  That said, it was good.  To me, not great, just good.  We got the combination appetizer plate.  The spring roll was amazing.  The crab was great.  I didn't like the ""egg roll"" as much as I thought I would, but it was definitely fresh.  I had fresh coconut juice to drink and it was delightful.  I would go back again for sure, but I would be ordering something other than the pho.",1
"Second to worst dining experience of all time.

Our waitress was a little timid, which is fine, but it we shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes just to order our food.  Our food took 45+ minutes to arrive, and while our friend's steak came out hot, our Hibachi Steak and Potatoes were room temperature.  Sent it back to be warmed, they offered to pay for it, which is great.  Both managers came and said hi and apologized for the slow cook staff, and made sure everything was great. 

That was the last we saw of them for the next half hour.  We finished our meals, and 10 minutes later, had to flag down a different waitress to go and find our waiter, and to bring us cheesecake menus.  We always get the Dulce de Leche, but they brought us terrimisu or some junk.  I gave it back to the waiter (after walking the restaurant to hunt him down) and said ""no thanks, I'll just pass on the cheesecake.""  He looked surprised, and later said we didn't have to pay for that cheesecake.  Well I'd sure hope not!

Two hours of my life are gone.  I usually like this restaurant, but tonight's service disaster will prevent me from EVER going to this location again, free food or not.",0
"The night was dark and hazy, a midwinter's eve that started with promise. A quick trip to the Yelp site quickly revealed the #1 restaurant in Tempe to be, in fact, a brewery. This delighted my boyfriend, a beer connoisseur, and me too, being a fan of highly rated restaurants and anything that makes my man happy. So we headed to the Four Peaks with high expectations and high spirits. Alas, our hopes were dashed almost from the beginning. 
The hostesses greeted us from the curb. They were extremely young and scantily clad in low, low, LOW slung jeans that did not cover their clearly illegal behinds. The place was crowded so we took a beacon and hit the bar for our first round. The bartender, despite a packed house, noticed us almost immediately and took our orders... the only quick service we received all night. The beers, well, the Kilt Lifter was a fine example of a 80 shilling Scottish ale... but the Raj IPA was heavy in diacetyls and but otherwise a reasonable attempt at an English IPA. Hopknot IPA was above average IPA with pleasing grapefruit aroma.
By the time we were seated we were happily woozy from the beers. Unfortunately, it took the bitch waitress nearly 20 minutes to take our orders and another 20 before our meals arrived. Food was decent, although side orders were botched... we DID notice the very nice disposable napkins, which were durable yet soft. Some of the nicest napkins I've ever seen of a disposable nature. 
Overall, a good people watching experience, very loud and crowded, with terrible service, adequate beer, and generic yet palatable cuisine. Would we go back? Not unless invited by good friends. Overrated.",0
"A group of friends and I decided to check out Vincent's Saturday Market this past weekend after a beautiful morning hike had worked up our appetites.  When we got there, the place was packed (but still had space to accomodate our group of 6).  It was the perfect outdoor market feel, with fresh vegetables from the garden available for purchase, next to organic lotions and soaps, and all sorts of food stands to whet any appetite (crepes, tacos, paninis, etc).  There was even a mimosa stand, where for $20 you could purchase a bottle of champagne, a glass of OJ, and as many plastic cups as needed.  This is definitely going to be added to my list of favorite places to enjoy a beverage while observing some extremely entertaining people watching!  I loved it, and hope to go again soon!",1
"Your typical Tempe boozatorium.

It has a generic and unmemorable name likely because the name describes everything about this place.

Absolutely delicious food at reasonable prices. Only complaint is that they only sell cans of soda. This kind of meal requires a big old drink,1
"A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a table.  When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long.

We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80.

Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there.  Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full bar, so if you're going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck.",1

"I've been going to Lake Pleasant Dentistry for 2-3 years now and Dr. Sharon Bader is hands-down the best dentist I've ever had.  I've traditionally had bad experiences with dentists and am always wary of any dental procedure, but I've never felt more comfortable than with Dr. Bader.

She is very accommodating, puts you at ease, explains all the options and does GREAT work and will stand behind it.  She did a pretty complex crown for me when the tooth was borderline whether it could be saved and it worked out great.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone.",1
"I went to Sutra to attend the mixer where Yelp was being featured. After soaking in the cool ""sceney"" vibe, I decided that I was hungry. I asked the waitress for a menu. When she came back she told me that the right hand side of the menu was half off and made a couple suggestions. I love the names of the rolls that Sutra has. There were selections like ""Cougar"" and ""30k millionaire"". I had one of each. As if the rolls were made to live up to their namesakes, they didn't impress me; they merely annoyed me. The lack of freshness and flavor were the biggest factors in Sutra's failure. I ended up leaving plenty of sushi on my plate, but I was relieved that they were half off, otherwise I would have returned them upon first bite. 

I would not eat at Sutra again if I had a choice. I would advise you to eat elsewhere and come to Sutra to see and be ""scene""!",0
"I've been to this location several times but I'd rather be more positive than nit-picky.  The service has always been a bit slow and less informative.  I've come in and on several occasions lost out on the specials till the very end when the server mentions ""next time you should do the...."" well I wish I would've known that earlier because I could've enjoyed more awesomeness!  Otherwise I love the atmosphere and the seating.  The space is really good, outdoor seating during this time of the year is jam and ambience are spot on for a group or a more datish type situation.  I've tried a few of the dishes and the food is pretty good but nothing yet that I've built up a craving for.

"You have no idea how happy I was when this place opened - and turned out to be good! I was really tired of driving into Scottsdale to get my hair cut. I lucked out when I booked an appointment and by luck of the draw wound up being styled by Maira. She's great at what she does, sweet as can be, and always remembers little details of my life that even I forgot I told her!

I really like that they don't even try to push product on you, unlike many other salons, and they give you a mini-massage before your shampoo.

I took a star away because of a bad experience I had with one of their aestheticians about 2 years ago. She put Retinol on my eyelids, which is a no-no. Lots of itching and pain for a few days afterwards. She also made like she was giving me a product for free, but wound up charging me for it. Like I said, that was 2 years ago and I don't think that aesthetician is still working there, but I haven't gone in for anything other than a haircut since. If you want a facial, Blu-Sol is just a couple of doors down.

A shampoo, cut and style runs me $32 plus tip. Much better than driving to Scottsdale and paying twice as much for the same service!",1
"This is quite literally the best burger I have ever eaten. The rocket bacon cheeseburger with 3 patties of meat on a 10 in. sesame sub roll and is nothing short of amazing. It could easily be shared. The cheese fries and onion rings are homemade. We love the casual environment and the huge selection of glass bottled soda. To top it off the prices are amazing! This is our first time here but we are hooked. We would love to see this place on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, DDDinfo@mac.com, so if you love it here, nominate it!",1
"Tasty standard bar food.
Great bar service.
Sweet servers (90% of the time).
Huge awesome patio.

The cherry on top is that it is NOT on mill ave!

Best spot to be at on a beautiful spring afternoon in Arizona.

What else could you possibly need?",1
Another lovely mom and pop with fabulous authentic thai.  The prices are very reasonable and I've never had a problem with the service.,1
"Thank God that The Vig wasn't open when I lived just down the street!  I would've lived there!  I was back in town in the fall and after brunch across the street at Dick's we needed MORE post-brunch champers.  Over to The Vig we went.  

How darn cute!  When I lived in Phoenix, this was a BofA training center and my standard ATM spot.  I like it better as The Vig.  We enjoyed many, many of the $5 mimosas with your choice of fresh juices (orange, grapefruit, strawberry or watermelon).  Yummy!  We stayed so long and drank so many mimosas that we had to order nachos.  They were really tasty.

Sitting out on the patio in late October in short sleeves with friends and champagne was delightful for this Chicagoan.",1
"A ski-lodgey pizzeria. This says it all. Well, almost. While the decor may be a bit ""weird"" and ""puzzling,"" make no bones about it, the beer selection is great.

Let's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?

DINNER:

Arrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered ""All Day Happy Hour,"" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their ""Half and Half."" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time. 

My family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that. 

Overall, the food is average ""bar style"" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options. 

JUST DRINKS:

Now we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)

As for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap! 

Sure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle. 

SO WHY GO? 
Uhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)

If you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!",1
"We found Ippei happhazardly through United Airline's dining points program and were instantly hooked.  We now frequent the place at least once or twice a week.

A great atmosphere with a very warm and welcoming host, Michael.  It has all of the ambiance of a very chic place, without the attitude and pompous feel.  The wait staff are all very attentive and pleasant.  The drinks are creative.  And if you're lucky, the owner may join you in a sake bomb, though he insists this is not authentic Japanese tradition.

I'm not a huge sushi person and was mainly brought along by my friends, so I can't comment on all the finer touches on the sushi and whatnot.  I can say, however, that if you ask really nicely you may be able to try a roll that the chefs are working on that is not yet on the menu, including a rib-eye roll that is absolutely delicious and friendly to those of us that shy away from sushi because of the whole raw fish deal.

Prices are very reasonable.  This is an up-and-coming spot that is still fairly quiet, but not for long.  Come now before you have to worry about getting a reservation a week ahead of time.  As it is now, you can just walk in.

Great place to bring a date - low lighting, great service, great food, lots of fun.",1
"Some pretty decent mexican food, and quiet cheap as well. $5 for a burrito, though it's not as big as the $6/$7 burritos or taste as good as the ones in San Jose, CA, it was still good. if I was from here, I'd probably come here a lot.. maybe a little too much though. I tried an Arizona Burrito, which was potatoes, cheese, and steak burrito. Pretty good, though the potatoes seemed a little too hard, but it was whatever. Just tasty greasy food, my brother said it's the perfect hangover food, and they are open late so :).",1
"Okay, it's a nice place but I'm not sure I would drive out of my way to go here. I was in town on business staying nearby and thought I'd give them a try. The food was good, but not great. The shredded beef taco was typical and the shredded pork burrito tasted more like beef. The red chili sauce had an okay flavor but the heat level seemed to simply over power everything (and I like hot). The restaurant is very nice inside, very upscale. I guess if you wanted to spend alot for a Mexican dinner in a very nice setting this would be the place. Service was so so, maybe it was because I was a party of one. Whatever the reason, it wasn't a happening thing. Hey, at least the salsa was tasty.",0
"Descent food, of course it's not autentico. Free chips, salsa, & wifi though.",0
"If you love BBQ, this place is for you.  

Nostalgic feel with a farm tactor sitting in the dining room.  Good selection of sides and the rootbeer is home made.  

Like Joe's Farm Grill, this place can draw a crowd and you'll be in for a long wait for service but timing is everything.

Can be a bit pricey is you load up but the quality of the food is top notch!

I'll definately be back.",1
"Taberna and Ninfa's are owned by the same restaurant group out of Houston.  Is it a coincidence that the FTR for Taberna is by someone who has only reviewed both of these spots and gave each five stars?  I think not.

Here's my objective review:

Taberna is in the Scottsdale Seville where Roy's used to be.  They have a large outside patio that will be great when the weather is nice.

I ate lunch at the bar and enjoyed chatting with the friendly bartender.  The menu is upscale Mexican food.  

I liked the basket of chips they brought out to start.  It came mixed with chips and plantains and two nice salsas.

I also ordered the al carbon steak enchiladas.  They were good and spicy served with what I believe was a mole sauce.

Overall the quality of the food was good but a little expensive.  I would come back, but it's not at the top of my list.",0
"It's brand new so it doesn't smell fishy yet.   It will soon just like all other Asian markets.

Looks like they will have another place to eat inside but it's still under construction from what I can tell.

They have Durian, I really want to try one because they are supposed to be so gross and stink to high heaven.

Banana blossoms?  How would I cook those things.

Food is divided into ""Regions"" so if you want Japanese noodles you go to one isle, Korean noodles in another isle etc.  It's a bit confusing but fun to look at all the different stuff.",1
"Big fan of this store - the owner tries very hard to create an inviting atmosphere for all levels of gamers. Further, the store provides for a host of niches, including euro-games, Ameritrash, role playing, and miniature wargaming. Good amount of supplies (both GW and P3, among others). Lots of tables for miniature gaming, board games, CCGs, and painting in the back (and a fridge with soda). They've started carrying MTG over the last few months, and that collection has grown. Always something going on here, but nothing intimidating. 

The owner is very, very helpful: willing to answer questions about painting, games, and to make special orders (even trips over to Gilbert at Battlefoam when necessary). Yep, big fan.",1
"My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.

She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.

They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.

I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).

Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!

I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!

So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis.",0
Been a loyal customer since they opened ten years ago.  Quality cut and great people. These are professional barbers who have been doing this for years.  No froo froo!  Russian not spoken there!,1
"my husband and I started going to Keegan's on Sunday's for their brunch, which is pretty decent. If you get there after 10am, the bar is open, which is a plus in my book. 
We've eaten lunch and dinner there a few times as well. They have a really good french onion soup, another soup I think was chicken pepper jack and the cobb sandwich is good. Their chicken fried steak is pretty good as well. They give you two decent sized steaks covered in mashed potatoes and gravy.
The bar is good as they have a great selection of beers. 
I also love their ice tea, it always hits the spot.",1
"We have been here several times and each time has been excellent. Our first time was in Hawaii and we were happy to see one in phoenix. 
        Me and my Fiancee had a four course Valentine's day dinner here. Dinner was great.  Food was timed right and our server was on top of it.   Our server sent us a personal handwritten post card thanking us.  Dinner came to be a little over $200 with drinks, so yes its pricey, but my fiancee and I loved it so it was worth it.",1
"I've learned to expect very little from airport restaurants.  Now I've been ruined - I went to Blanco and my paltry expectations were blown out of the water. Prompt and attentive service, flavorful and delicious food, and a delightful assortment of drink options.  I'll have to connect through Phoenix for the rest of my life. 

I had the grilled shrimp salad, which was fresh, flavorful, and filling. I also had the sangria, which was pretty good. My friends had tacos (fish and carnitas); they practically licked their plates clean.  Try the rice - it is a rich and delectable treat. 

An added bonus: They were patient as we sat for three hours waiting for our connecting flight. If I ever find myself in this airport again, you can be sure I'll make my way here.",1
"I give Riva's 4 stars because of the secret top burrito in town which is the California burrito and have them put a chilli relleno in the burrito which is the best of all worlds.  So basically this burrito consists of carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo, cheese and a chilli relleno all wrapped up in a delicious tortilla.  Once you add some hot sauce to that it equals one of the best burritos in town.  I learned of this only because of one of the employees telling me to get it this way because all the people that work there eat it this way.  You have to try it!",1
"Fruity Pebbles! YAY!

They don't have a sign up yet, but we were walking by and noticed they were open and there were happy people inside so they must be, oh yes it was true, giving away free frozen yogurt! 

They were offering original (vanilla) and pomegranate flavors to choose from, I chose pomegranate. They have fruity pebbles as a topping which made me very happy, since that was my favorite cereal as a kid.",1
"They have plenty of equipment so there should never be a wait for anything. They offer great classes, although they tend to get too full sometimes. It would be nice if there was a restroom up front so you don't have to walk through the entire shower/locker room if all you need to do is pee!",1
"I get a call on Thursday: ""Dude, I just got fired from UOP, we have to celebrate!"" If it was from anyone else but Ryan, I would have been shocked. However, he hated his job and we love Yard House, so I was definitely down to have some ""FU UOP"" drinks up at Desert Ridge.

Yard House has been one of our main spots for years. Right off the bat, the Happy Hour is fantastic; 100+ beers on tap, including some of AZ's finest and a couple amazing international brews. The servers usually do a great job of suggesting drinks as well. Traditionally I ""cleanse the palate"" with a Warsteiner Pilsner and roll from there. Friday night, I tipped back a few Kiltlifters as well, all brought in well frosted pint glasses.

The food has been pretty fantastic across the board. Personally, you can't go wrong with Firecracker Wings (sweet and very spicy wings) and the Spinach Dip. Their seared ahi appetizer and Caesar salad are both fantastic, with the ahi always perfectly cooked. The Southern Fried Chicken Breast is likely the best meal, though my pal is a huge fan of the Cuban Dip.

The one potential drawback is the service isn't always fast. Honestly, if you are going to relax and enjoy time with your friends, it's great. Beer glasses don't stay empty too long, waters get refilled (we only sit on the patio), and the food usually comes out before you get too hungry. Just understand that the joint gets busy for happy hour and you will enjoy the experience. Give me a call if you ever want to share some FU beers!",1
There are definitely better places to go to in Old Town. Overall Martini Ranch is usually pretty slow and charge a cover to get into an empty place. Last time I went there my friend and I got our cover back because it was so dead. They do have good martinis though.,0
"The Montelucia Resort is home to Crave Cafe, and the fact that I was blown away by how beautiful the resort is has nothing to do with how impressed I was with Crave.

What are you craving at the moment?  Perhaps a cup of coffee?  a scoop of gelato?  an empanada? gourmet pastry?  homemade tomato soup?  perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey, cheese,  grilled eggplant, and cranberry compote? red wine? magazine? fresh fruit? Diet Coke?

Whatever your 'crave-ing' - Crave has it all!

In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain.

After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!  I am sure I'll be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon, and when I do, I'm sure I'll pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time.",1
"This is a fun POOL party club in Scottsdale next to everyone's favorite, American Junkie. I have never eaten here, other than a dessert that I don't remember. ;) It can also be a fun place for after dinner drinks or dance. The ambiance of relaxing and drinking next to a pool always brings about a good time. The music is LOUD and the bartenders are nice. Their bathrooms are clean and pretty. 

Spanish Fly rages during the daytime summer weekends, and is a great place to hang out when you still want to enjoy the outdoors and it's blazing hot outside. I will be going back - glad to have you in Scottsdale, Spanish Fly.",1
"Jeremiah is great! He is very friendly, patient, and knows what he's doing! 

We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread, it's ok. Not something I would want again. Nothing wrong with it, just not my taste. 

For lunch, I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, along with a house salad. The sandwich is great. Loved it. 
The house salad... I mean, I could not stop eating it. I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it, but it was AMAZING. I am craving it just thinking about it. 

The interior is very clean, roomy, very casual. I heard they have great happy hour, so I will be back again.",1
"Wish I could review this place on service but I wasn't able to get one.  Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi, was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.  I get it, I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.  You know your salon, you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away  

The place in general was dirty, nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy.",0
"Great gluten free Italian place! Tell all you gluten free friends, they will love you for it!",1
"EXCELLENT!  What a fun time we had.  Hubby and I went out for my bday celebration and were so glad that we did.  What a fun and comfortable experience.  We walked in and were greeted right away.  We had made reservations but there was absolutely no reason to.  It was a Monday night and really @ 7:30 there wasn't a whole lot going on.  

Alec was our server.  We opted to sit in the bar area.  Same menu available.  We started off with the Haas Guac and the Green Chile Stew.  We initially made the mistake thinking that the stew was going to be like the kind @ Roaring Fork.  It's not.  They would do themselves a favor if they called it hash.  I suppose hash is not as appealing as stew.  Nonetheless it was good.  The little fry breads that they give were not my favorite but it was good with the chips that came with the guac.  I had the pork tenderloin and hubs had the mac and cheese with chicken.  Both good.  Really good.  

It would have been a five star review but there was something weird tasting in my diet coke.  Like soap or something.  Hubby thought maybe it was because they probably didn't sell a whole lot of soda product. I dunno.  Could have been the straw, the glass, syrup ratio to C02. 

And by far which is probably the best part of the restaurant.  THE BEST CHAIRS in the world.  So comfy.  So plush.  You could sit there for hours and never leave.  IF you had them in your home you would never leave.  EVER!!!!",1
"Out of all of the Flo's locations, this is the one I've frequented the most over the past 3 years of living in the Valley.  I've seen the menu change here and there, but I have to say, I've never had a bad meal at Flo's.

I met my friend Melanie H for dinner this evening and we really enjoyed our meal... we had great service - our waters stayed filled throughout the time we were there, and our food was served promptly. Our server checked on us several times as well.  We started with vegetable pot stickers and requested that they come steamed.  They were delicious! Next, we shared 'Indian Curry Vegetables' (I ordered it with shrimp) and Indian Vindaloo Chicken.  Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies, chicken, and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice.  The curry vegetable dish came with broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and long beans.  The chicken dish had tomatoes and onions. We also had steamed white rice.

Note to Flo: We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari. One more thing - the chicken corn soup that you serve at the DC Ranch location should be offered at the others as well - I love that soup!

Fortune cookies came along with the check and we both were happy with our fortunes.  The bill didn't break the bank either.  See you again soon, Flo!",1
"I am a HUGE fan of micro breweries. Gordon Biersch is cool... a little ""chain-like"", but the ambiance is great.  I felt like I was under dressed.

I had the seafood cobb, which was awesome. They use REAL crab here... thank god.

Hubs had a large burger... he loved it and loved the garlic fries. 

I had the Hefeweizen and hubs had a couple Schwarzbiers. Not bad at all.",0
"Our hotel was awesome enough to have beach cruisers you could borrow to ride around downtown. This is the only reason why my friend and I got all the way to Old Town on our one and a half hour break until dinner. It is such a cute little area. I loved all the little shops they had. It felt like we were walking around in an old cowboy town and I couldn't help but yell ""YEE HAW!"" I just had to get it off my chest.",1
"My fiancee and I found this place on-line when we were looking fot sushi in the Central Phoenix area. Neither of us had heard of it but we decided to give it a go. We got there around 8:30 and the place was kindof empty so we were a little nervous. We walked in and were seated at a table by the window. We were seated with dinner menus but not a sushi menu. Ther server said they only give those out at the sushi bar. I thought that was a little wierd but the server was nice and the decor was hip and modern (it was metrosexual according to my fiancee) so we went with it. 

We ordered lots and lots of sushi - ika salad, hamachi sashimi ($9), spicy tuna roll ($7), shrimp tempura roll ($7), and the sunshine roll ($11) (spicy salmon with lemon on top). We could not complain about anything! It was all very very good. It tasted fresh, yummy, and hit the spot. The total bill was $47.00 which sounded about right considering how much food we ordered! 

We liked the decor, the service, and the food. I noticed they had a lunch menu so I will be taking my co-workers back with me next time!",1
"One word: PISTACHIO...
in all its glory...
no need to say more.",1
"While in the area we wanted something for lunch but knew we'd be having dinner out that same evening. Not wanting to fill up too much we ordered an appetizer and entree to share. 
The lettuce wraps with shrimp were so good! Fresh and crispy veggies accompanied seasoned shrimp all wrapped in butter lettuce leaves. It was light and tasty. For our entree we ordered the Hawaiian mahi mahi which came with a pineapple, red pepper and onion mixture over a bed of rice. The fish was a little overcooked but still tasted pretty good. Star for the water glass test!",1
"We've been here several times with our kids and grandkids.  It's a good family spot, but the service is just okay.  We love the fresh chips, and the wings are good.  Salads are 'meh'.  We'll come again because it's a good spot for the kids, but we'll come expecting not great service.",0
"I just went here for lunch and mmm, mmm, mmm, this place is sooooo good!  I had the shrimp and veggie pho and the broth was VERY well-seasoned and so delicious going down my tummy!  We also had the shrimp spring rolls, which were also delicious and very refreshing.  

My only complaint, and the reason I couldn't give 5 stars, is that only 1 out of 3 air conditioners was working in the restaurant.  And on a day in Phoenix when it's109 degrees outside, plus the heat from the pho, we were burning up in there!  We had to go get some froyo afterwards just to bring our body temps back down to a normal level!  I look forward to going back when the temps cool down.",1
"A couple of us came here Friday and had a good time. I liked the off-the beaten path location and the fact that there was no cover. They have 2-4-1 drinks 8-10pm, too. I thought the music was good and drinks weren't too expensive. The thing that almost ruined my time was constantly being bumped by people. It is hard to get into the groove when you are being shoved and pushed by people who think they have an entire dance floor to themselves. But isn't that every place, though?",1
"Wildflower really is a fantastic place and I feel a bit bad giving them only 4 stars. 

Let me say up front that this is a place that I go frequently and I love. However, they have some great food and some...not so great food. 

If you like soup, try the Potato Cream Cheese.....even my husband, who's definitely not a soup fan, loved it. It's even better when you get it with the sourdough bread....it's comfort food, what can I say? Their sandwiches are mostly good. There's a few duds in there that I can't stand. I'm not a huge fan of the vegetarian one, it just tasted off to me and was a bit of a different combination of ingredients. Also, their Brie and Ham Frittata? I ended up searching around in it for the bits of ham and egg...I love brie, I just figured out I don't love it in a frittata. 

All in all, it really is a great place to go. My husband lives for the braised beef sandwich when they have it and their desserts are fantastic - you can't go wrong with anything in the magic glass case up front!

Plus, the Tempe location is right beside Changing Hands - it's like a two for one deal! :-)",1
Really good prices but I would stray from the wings. It is very greasy so beware!,0
"Met a few friends here for happy hour.  They had $5 martinis, but that's not what I ended up getting.  They have a drink special everyday.  That day they had the Walter Crankite, I think!  It was like an appletini with cranberry juice.  We didn't order anything else.  The service was great.  Our servere was very attentive.",0
"Awesome awesome awesome!!! Our table all ordered a 5 course tasting  and it was amazing!! The flavors pop in your mouth!! Very creative chef. I don't think there was one course we were disappointed in. By the end of the 3 hour dinner we had a total of 21 courses. Each one full of flavor making you want more. The staff was excellent, always there when you need them but not hovering. I would definitely go again. Pricey but so worth it!!",1
"So, this will not be my best review, especially when I expected so much more from this place.

Lets get this out of the way and on the table first, this ws not a bad place to go, but, it wasnt my favorite by any means.  I went in expecting to pay a lot for the meal, and rightfully expected the best food I have ever had, and that was just NOT the case.  From the high prices to the limited menu, I would expect this place to specialize in the particular menu items, and would hope to have my taste buds dancing while I shout for more.  I didnt.

We started the meal with burratta forno cotto mozzarella.  it consists of oven baked burrata mozzarella served with grilled ciabatta, fried eggplant, lemon-truffle vinaigrette and parsley.  There were only two tiny ciabatta slices which was not the first complaint.  the second complaint would be that the fried eggplant could have used a bit more flavor.  (perhaps a little lemon pepper in the batter would have done some good) Lastly, the dish could have satisfied by just having a bit more cheese.  This dish was not bad by any means, just expected a bit more with the $12 price of two miniature slices of ciabatta and two thinly sliced pieces of eggplant.

on to the salad.  I dont know about you, but, when I order a salad, I expect a salad.  this was a salad, just not with any lettuce or salad look.  we ordered the caprese di pomodoro.  this dish is made with heirloom tomatoes, preserved lemon, herbs, fresh burrata mozzarella and extra virgin olive oil.  from the description, i assumed, dont ever assume, that this was going to have some spring mix as a salad base, then have the tomatoes witih cheese and basil, and then the lemon with olive oil as a dressing.  WRONG.  it was nothing more than what the description said.  it was two tomatoes cut in half, with a small amount of cheese and a few basil leaves and then the lemon preserve mixed with the olive oil on top.  dont get me wrong, this ws absolutely AMAZING, and I would love to have it again.  It is just not what I expected, so, it would have been nice to know what exactly I was ordering for $10.

To make matters worse, our so called salad took about 30 minutes to make its way to the table after putting in the order.  it took so long that the chef actually apologized and told management that he was going to send out a soup for us for the wait.  we were fine and in no rush, but, when we were already having our food take forever and told we were going to get soup, we expected it.  the soup never came.

finally, after waiting for and hour and a half for our main entree, we got our food.  it was good, but, nothing to write home about.  my pollo portofino was bland to say the least, and was actually a little dry.  the potatoes were decent, but again, a bit bland.

my date got the ravioli di mozzarella con salsa all'arrabbiata.  the ravioli pasta was so thick that you really couldnt taste the filling, and the sauce was to sweet in my and my date's opinion.

we however did order a side of the risotto parmigiano, and this was just amazing.  I am very happy that the recipe was on a poast card that came with the bill.  I will be making this at home in the coming week.

for dessert, we ordered pistachio gelato.  it was the best gelato I have ever had.

when it comes to a decision of returning to Alto, it will not be high on my list due to being over priced for what you get and all around, just not the best first experience.  I will however think of stopping in to get some risotto or gelato to go.

when it comes to good Italian, I think I will be sticking with Italian Gratto or Pane e Vino.",0
"I have no idea whether there is a Japanese community in this part of town, but New Tokyo would suit one well.  It's rather small, but they have a wide selection of Japanese, snacks, beverages (including my new fave beer, Asahi Black), refrigerated items, staples, etc.  

This is not an Asian market, it's specifically Japanese, so don't expect more than a few crossover items like kimchi.  That being said, sometimes it's good to specialize.  It lets them carry more variety of Japanese products.

The cashier was very friendly when I finally stopped loading my basket long enough to check out.  Like the first reviewer, I loaded up with snacks for the hotel room...along with a six-pack of Asahi Black, of course.  Oh, one more important factor...the prices were quite reasonable, in line with most ethnic market imports...maybe even a bit cheaper than usual.",1
"I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch! 

The service was kind of slow..not sure if it was on purpose so I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious! Got the chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia and would def recommend it. Everything tasted really fresh! A perfect lunch spot :)",1
"Took my fiance' there for Valentine's day/ Birthday.  I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley, and this one really caught my eye.  Immediately after walking through the door, you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.  Seating is a bit tight, but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.  We began with an appetizer called ""Table side guacamole"" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said ""Happy Valentine's Day!"" and ""Happy Birthday!"" to my fiance', which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!",1
Nice Plaza.  Very well located.  Clean store.  Friendly staff.   All you could want,1
"Coming from a place where there is mexican food on every couple streets, I have truly missed an authentic mexican restaurant or joint. This place is legit! Good tacos, good burritos, real good non-taco bell mexican! 
If you want some real Mexican food, try this place out!",1
"Great location.  Nice decor.  The food was adequate, but $13 for the turkey pastrami sandwich was a little high for a lunch.  I guess those chandeliers are expensive and rent at the Waterfront cannot be cheap.  Our server was poorly trained.  She placed the food in front of me instead of the lady first. I asked for water and the server brought only one glass of water and didn't bother to ask about the lady's needs.  This venue is not for those who appreciate fine or even appropriate service.  Sam needs to educate his young servers on the finer points of courtesy.  Our server was also extremely bored with her job, her life, and her existence.  That's the impression we received.",0
"My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch. I suggested Mexican so then we were thinking which Mexican restaurant sounded good. (Living in AZ, you know there's MANY to choose from) So my mom suggested going to Blue Adobe so all of us headed there. 

My mom, my dad, my sister, my nephew, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas. One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada. It was SO delicious! The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other. My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it. My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those. And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were. And my 5 year old nephew loved his kids cheese enchilada. Our server was named Travis and he was great as well. Phenomenal service. Even if Travis had been sub-par, I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is.",1
"Went here for a work function today. What can I say, this place is awesome! A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum!

Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon.

Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm.

Simply awesome stuff! Taking the wife when I can.",1
"Don't bother with this place.  I had never been here, my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home.  We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba.  When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.  Never going back, such a complete disappointment.",0
"Not terrible.  I got the drunken noodles and pad thai.  Not the best, but not the worst.  Maybe I'll try them again and update my review...",0
"Lets just set the record straight here. Zoe's serves Mediterranean just like Qdoba serves Mexican.

When I say just like the Q, I mean the entire experience. Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoe's food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, they're my favorite Medi in CenPho so far. 

The staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, the food was in no way ""bad"", per se. I just can't shake the feeling of ""I've had better"" when thinking about my experience.

If you're looking to fill your belly with food just because it's time to eat, this might just be the place for you. If you're interested in a great Mediterranean meal, I implore you to please try something new. I likely won't be returning, we do live in the city of a million restaurants, go out and choose one! (but don't take me at my word on that just made up fact).

Happy Yelping Phoenix, now where's my hummus?",0
"If I've come to your Starbucks over 30x within 5 months and you still don't bother learning how to pronounce my name correctly then I don't know what to say. I always order the same drink: quad espresso with 3 pumps of white mocha and 80% of the time they don't get my order right! The baristas always ask if I want water or milk with it.. Seriously? I ordered a damn espresso for a reason. If I wanted water or milk then I would've ordered something else and NOT an espresso! And my drink is one of the simplest drinks to make too!! Just brew 4 shots, mix in white mocha syrup and add ice.. But they always somehow mess up by asking me stupid questions. If it weren't  for this sb being the closest to school, I would definitely frequent the Thunderbird location!",0
"Kristi's review said, ""Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me."" Well, that's good enough for me. And before the Yelp paparazzi shows up to muckrack... no I didn't take Kristi to Cheuvront's. I know better than that - I only hang with Kristi at dive bars. 

So I did take my lovely date to Cheuvronts. The decor and ambiance - think wide open and urban and dark without being too dark. It really set a mood. We ordered a bottle of wine from a fantastic list, along with a cheese plate and a pate plate. We had them select the cheeses to pair with the wine we had chosen with a few instructions as to cheese preferences. They have a selection of pates as well, and we had them choose similarly.

The cheese plate contained three cheeses, all superb. It was served with (good!) bread, some nuts, and some dried cranberries. The two pate plate was similarly served with bread and dark, delicious mustard. The pates were fantastic - the cheese plate and pate plate seemed destined to be served together. 

The food and drink were great, the service a little spotty especially since there weren't that many people in there. I'm guessing the waitress just didn't want use to feel like she was bothering us. After taking our time to enjoy the wine, cheese, and pate, we were both feeling full with no room for even dessert. 

Overall, a great meal, my date thought it was one of the best places she had ever been to, and I'm clearly going to have to pay more attention to Kristi's reviews.",1
"I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me.",0
"For what Pei Wei is...I love this place.  Casual fast dining with great food at a great value.  If you've ever been to P.F. Chang's, this place is owned by the same company and offers similar fare.  

Be prepared to wait during peak hours as this place always does a steady business (at all their locations).  I often call ahead and order take out.  I've had nearly everything on the menu.  The Vietnamese Salad rolls are really light and yummy.  Can't go wrong with the orange peel chicken.  Oh, and the honey seared shrimp is great too...however that one needs to be eaten at the restaurant...it's like an In & Out burger & fries...best eaten ASAP.",1
"Over Hyped ??... Yeah a little but its definitely worth checking out !
The pizzas are freshly baked and very minimalistic but extremely tasty ! I particularly loved the ROSA -  Red Onion, Rosemary, Pistachios sprinkled with just the right amount of Parmigiano Reggiano on a thin crisp crust ! 

The classy brick wall and the gorgeous brick oven give a rustic feel to the décor and you feel transported to another time.",1
I love this place: look for the specials and the different events they always have going on. It's a great spot in the Valley.,1
"Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call.",1
"I'm pretty sure that Palee's Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to. The service is always great, and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there.
The food is so amazing, I have never tried something that I disliked at all. I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys. I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave. I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks, and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream. Don't make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what you're eating, just try it.
The prices are good and if you're not sure what to try, stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct, and very spicy.",1
"I recently tried vietnamese food, maybe 3 years ago.  I especially like the pho soup and spring rolls.  Since then, I have been trying every place I can that serves pho.  Out of every place that I have been so far, this place is always the one I come back to.  It's a little hole in the wall type place.  The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you weren't looking for it.  The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion.  It's about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found.  It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts, basil, mint, lime, and jalapeno.  The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.  The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.  He told me himself that this is probably the best place he has found to eat pho at, and based on the fact that it is usually packed with asian people during lunch time, I am very inclined to believe him.",1
"I use to LOVE Kazimierz so I am trying to be fair in giving it 3 stars.  Most of my experiences have been 4 stars but the last two visits here have been a 1 or 2 star so...

Kazimierz is a hidden, fantastic wine bar in Scottsdale, which use to be very intimate and was a great spot to cozy up to a date.  Lately though they have been packing people in to this awesome bar which has so much potential.  It's elbow to elbow now, with pretty bad service but still a great wine selection.  

I'll still come here whenever I'm visiting the area because I have a soft spot for it, and I am hoping it returns back to the awesome, secret cozy wine get away it use to be, and I know in the area, there isn't really any other spot, no matter how bad the service, that compares to it.",0
"This local restaurant is a gem. This is located down the street from the Hilton at Squaw Peak and probably the best restaurant in the area that is filled with a lot of chain type restaurants. I had heard about the Rokerij small plates menu from office workers and I thought I would give it a try. My girlfriend and I did not have any reservations, so we went downstairs in their bar area and ate the bar. You can order the Mew Mexican specialities or the Rokerij side of the menu. There was so much to choose from so we decided to eat off of the small plates menu. We chose the 3 small plates for $25. I was thinking the plates were going to be small and that we would not be filled. I appreciated that on the menu they told you how many ""pieces"" you were going to get of each item. The tenderloin on toast with triple cream brie was delicious. The amount of tenderloin was just right and the cream brie made it taste over the top. The scallops were cooked perfectly as well. Thoroughly enjoyed the taco sampler. Everything is fresh and the service was great. The couple next to us ordered off of the New Mexican cuisine side. The servings were ample and looked very tasty. I have heard the menu for brunch is equally fanstastic, can't wait to go back!",1
"Amazing greek food! Definitely try the greek fries!  I always try to come here every time I am in Phoenix.  Staff is also always very friendly!

Also try the greek calamari.  Unusually delicious!",1
"In short... great view, really expensive food.",0
Same menu as Phil's Grill but you can reserve a table on this side. Food is wonderful and service is great. Love the daily soup special. Try the wings but ask for them to be a little on the crispy side. The ribs are wonderful and they give you a lot. If you order the fries as an order be prepared to share with everyone in the restaurant. They give you enough for an army. Sunday night is half price wine and $5.00 burgers. Get there early as they pack them in.,1
"This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix. I've never had better pho than here. I usually order the ""spicy beef sate"" pho, which is miles above the rare beef pho. My family and I also order the pork ""spicy treats"" which is a roll-your-own spring roll. It's delicious and fun! One order feeds all five of us. 

The owner is also extremely nice. They also offer discounts to ASU students! Have to love that.",1
"My boyfriend and I decided to drive around Scottsdale and find a place for dinner on a Saturday night. Our initial impression of the place was that it was going to be too rich for our blood; however, we figured we would give it a shot. The decor reminded my boyfriend of nightclub scene from Scarface. 

When they sat us down initially we were right next to the kitchen which wasn't too pleasant. So we asked to be moved to another location and the hostess moved us into their private dinning room which we loved. 

Our server was very friendly and informative, yet also gave us space. We ordered crab cakes to start things off. They were excellent but slightly over priced given the portion size. Then we ordered a bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced and to our liking for $24 - a nice Argentinian Malbec. We decided on this bottle after our server brought us several other tastes. I ordered the soup of the day and my boyfriend got a caesar salad. Both were solid. For entrees I got a salmon with asparagus and my boyfriend ordered seared ahi tuna. Both were cooked to perfection.

Overall, being in the private dining room was perfect, noise level wise, and all of the staff made sure everything was up to par without being too over zealous. I would highly recommend this place.",1
"I love the story time program here! I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat. The staff here is amazing! It is a 30 minute session of singing, dancing, stories and bubbles. We look forward to this every week now. My daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet. The first thing she does is come home and color it. I am so thankful for this free program.",1
"Been to the Rose and Crown a couple of times now and have sampled some food. They have an extensive beer selection, including Sessions. It's an American lager. Very tasty! They also have Carlsberg, which I am told is the Bud Light of Europe. I still love it! The french fries are the TITS! They are so good I was unashamedly eating them off of someone else's plate without asking. I have had the Reuben and was uninspired. The corned beef was good, but overall just lacking. I guess that is what I get for getting a Jew sandwich at an Irish pub. 

The decor is cool! There are futbol kits and scarves along the walls. Ya know soccer? Wonder if they show games there on the weekends? Do they have TVs? Oh well. The place is a little small, but quaint. They do have a nice patio that has ample space. Cool place to hang out on a spring night. I think they had live music too.",1
"I met a friend for lunch yesterday. 

Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. 

Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of ""Dusk Till Dawn"". 

We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? 
We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. 

Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) 
There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.

For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. 
There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. 

My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.

I'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things.",0
"Really solid lunch deals and pretty close to Tex-Mex which I still get cravings for from time to time. I had the spinach chicken enchiladas and they were nice. It was a ton of food (of course) so we definitely needed boxes for leftovers. If you're in the neighborhood, it's a solid deal and I'd stop in again. My only wish is that they did a green sauce with the spinach chicken enchiladas. That would be heaven.",0
"Finally tried this place after passing it weekly for the last year or so. Atmosphere is pretty cool, but food lacked any special quality. Large glass of orange juice was nearly $6.00...WITHOUT the vodka (lol)! Hash browns were kind of burned, and small portion to boot. Probably won't go back, as there are so many other breakfast places nearby that are much better.",0
"This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.

It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. 

The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes.",1
Chef Bianco does it again! The homemade pasta is unreal. You can actually taste the freshness of all of the ingredients. The pasta is thick (like homemade pasta is supposed to be...) but not heavy at all. I also loved the casual vibe and the staff was very friendly and nice. You really feel like a guest sitting in the kitchen in a home somewhere in Italy.,1
"I have been to Lux a few times now and it has completely won me over with its delicious coffee and mouth watering chocolate croissants . There always seems to be a line but it moves fast. Among the numerous coffee shops in the area, Lux definitely stands out.",1
"The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.

They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.

If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.",1
I like it better then Denny's so I stop on by to get some breakfast. It's okay not the best place in the world but if your having a hard time picking between after hours with Dennys and Waffle house I would pick waffle house for sure.,0
"Ok, I have been coming to Wong's Place for a number of years now. I found this little gem when I was wandering about Tempe (No I am not homeless, nor do I wander off when I drink) ;)

Anyhow, the majority of the time that I order the food to go, it is really good. I have had only a few issues with the rice for the sizzling rice soup being overcooked but I will say that the soup is awesome and tastes awesome (Three flavor). Wong-Jo chicken is good with egg fried rice, egg foo yung, house deluxe chow mein, imprerial three delights, mongolian beef (not a huge portion, but tasty), and random other tastyness!! 

They have not updated the decor and everytime that I come in to get my order, I converse with the guy that always takes my order. He is not The Mr. Wong, but he is like his right hand man. He recently told me that they have not fired any of their workers because everyone has been working there for over 10 years. Even in this economy when business is OK at best, they take care of their people. 
I hope this place never closes down or I will be sad for them, and hard pressed to find anyone who can mirror the sizzling rice soup and wong-jo chicken. 

It is a typical chinese restaurant but I think the food is better than most chinese knock-off restaurants. I think that if you can enjoy the authentic atmosphere and the food (pink menu if you are scared of authentic chinese), then you should be satisfied with your meal. Personally, I get mine to go 99% of the time because I will take it home and not feel bad when I load my plate up with everything and go back for seconds!!",1
"Fat fries are good, but that's probably it. I had a turkey burger that didn't taste much better than something I could make in my microwave. I had ""everything"" but still could barely taste anything. 3 stars is because my brother had an L and it was really L. His also looked much better than mine did. All in all, it is better than most fast food, but really isn't worth it for the price you pay. Your wallet would thank you for hopping across the street to In 'n' Out, and your tastebuds would thank you for driving several miles east to 5 guys.",0
"This is one the best venues in Phoenix in my opinion for live music. Wonderfully low-lit, divey atmopshere, Great drink prices and down-to-earth crowd with no pretense or attitude. The bouncer/doorman was ALL pimped out and welcomed me with a handshake. This is really a great alternative from hitting a bar or a club. A true gem in The Valley. Only downside is parking. The neighbors don't like it if you park in front of their house-my friend was yelled at by one of them. And they ""punished"" me by positioning their trash cans in front of and in back of my car.  If said neighbor is reading this review, know this: Next time, I'm going to take out your stupid trash cans. I understand it sucks to have people park in front of your house, but I was not loud, nor did I puke or urinate or your lawn, so chill!",1
"Been a patron since this eatery first opened.  This is honestly one restaurant that has not been hurt by the economy.  The food is that fabulous!  My absolute favorite salad is the Turkey Waldorf.  My children always get the side Caesar with Potato Cream Cheese Soup.  The husband always gets either a Cranberry Scone and Onion Bagel slathered with cream cheese OR a Pretzel and some sort of sandwich.  

The only downside to this eatery is their lack of seating space during the lunch rush hour.  Get there by 11am if you actually want to sit inside, otherwise on a windy and cold winter day you might find yourself outside sitting on the patio (as I have done in the past.)

Even with the lack of seating during rush hour lunch....I'm giving this place five stars and making sure I'm there before the rush hour.  :-)  Happy Eats!",1
"In 'n' Out, I don't know how to tell you this, but . . . I've found someone else.  No, no, it's not like that, it was nothing you did!  Your burgers with their fresh toppings are delicious... but sometimes I just need a little change of pace, maybe something with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and bacon... mmm... bacon.  Oh, sorry.  You want to know the name?  I don't see why that...  You insist?  Okay... it's Five Guys.

Oh!  You're upset!  YOU'RE upset!  Well let me tell you what - Five Guys' fries are delicious, whether they come in Cajun OR regular!  And I NEVER liked your fries, In 'n' Out!  I just pretended to like them, but they're skinny, kind of limp, never flavorful, and you don't get very many.  Five Guys cuts 'em thick, salts them up, and pours an extra scoop into the bag, how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything!

What?  No... you're right, Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  That's true, it is over $10 for a burger, fries, and drink, as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant, they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!  Oh, that's right, you have surface parking, but don't try to pretend that's a feature with the temperature hitting 100!  You're ridiculous.

What's that?  Does Five Guys have milkshakes?  Uh... hm.  Milkshakes.  I never thought about that.  They don't.  Would you mind if I got my burger and fries from there and then came to you for the shake?  No?  Fine.  You're so overprotective and hyper-traditional sometimes.  Live a little.

I hope we can still be friends, In 'n' Out, but I just think I need to see other burgers.  Please don't pelt me with limp fries when I turn my back.",1
"So, if I rated The Grind based solely on the Sweet and Spicy Burger, I would give it a  Woohoo, five star rating, but, I'm not , just thought you should know, you need to get that burger if you come here.

I was a little surprised to see how small this restaurant is when my mom and I decided to come here for lunch (she was wanting burgers). This place reminds me of a narrow cave that happens to have a long bar with about 18 stools, six larger booths that can fit five patrons comfortably, four table tops, and three double occupancy booths. The bar is pretty cool, its lined with red lights and has eight rather large flat screen TVs you can see from the stools and the larger booths that we were seated at. I opted for the Sweet and Spicy burger ($12), thanks to Yelp, and my mom went with a plain ole cheeseburger ($11). Knowing that the burgers do not come with anything, we decided to order the sweet potato fries ($5) and both got iced teas ($2.5 each). My burger was delicious and was everything the title said it would be...sweet and spicy thanks to the sweet glazed jalapenos. I also enjoyed the crunchy, deep fried ratatouille, yum. My mom wasn't impressed with her simple cheeseburger and said she would order mine if she were to come back and we both enjoyed sharing the sweet potato fries.

Brent, our server, did a great job with suggestions and service. As lunch time got more busy and he got more tables he was always checking in with us and even put our iced teas in to-go cups. This place was, as the default Yelp display states, a-ok.  I'm glad I tried The Grind, but probably wouldn't suggest this place for lunch, but wouldn't hesitate to come back here if it is suggested by friends.

Breakdown:

one star for being a narrow cave
one star for the Sweet and Spicy Burger   -and-
one star for Brent, our awesome waiter.",0
"Should be called house of deliciousness!

I could go on and on about this item, that item, blah blah blah but I dont really waznt to. This is good food, done creatively, and in my mind presented in a casual yet sophisticated manner without any pretensiousness. The chef here creates inspirational dishes that seem to meld asian and southwestern flavors seemlessly. Ok so now I realize this are not all real words but after eating here and developing a drunken state of mind who really cares anyhow?

The lowdown is the food is good and priced fair for what you get. Our service was great and on top of everything we truly had an amazing time on a rainy Saturday evening. Next time hopefully we can enjoy the killer outdoor bar and patio seating.
I cant wait to go back and eat our way through the new menu.

The custom cocktails were delightful and the wine list is pretty spot on.",1
Jesse and I had a lovely evening out- we had great dishes and the owner was our server as well. He belts out a lovely Italian birthday song while playing the guitar. Very nice,1
"I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars because it was a typical hotel restaurant.  Didn't actually sit at the restaurant area but the bar lounge.  Service was very slow at best and on one night the waitress all but ignored us as she was chit chatting with other tables.  The food was ok, I'd have to rate it on the same level as Chilis although more ""upscale"" selections.  Only had the appetizers but based on those didn't want dinner.  My friend had the breakfast one morning and said it was very average.  I usually give better reviews on restaurants then what others give on Yelp but on this one, I beg to differ.",0
"Oooohhhh baby I loooove your way...everyday...yeeeaaaahhh.

I wanna be with you night and day....

Went back to the swizzle last night and fell in love again.

With pool.
With dives.
With football.
With beer.
With diversity.
With the random atrium.
With the jukebox.
With life.

How can you beat pool and beer, combined with an awesome location, a diverse crowd, and a room full of people screaming at the TV because football is on? Then top that with the weird quirkiness that makes me warm and fuzzy on the inside...the atrium, a lovely bathroom and random bumper stickers at the bar. 

The End.",1
"This is a really fun place to grab some cocktails or beers before an event or game. My friends and I have a tradition of drinking here before DBACKS games and we always love it. Drinks are reasonable, especially if you ask the specials, and way cheaper than beers at BOB. 

As for food they have an awesome menu, but the food came off a bit cheap in quality to me so I don't think it's worth ten dollars a plate. But if your hungry it will get the job done! Although...one of the days I want to try and eat one of those One Pound hot dogs they have. It is a personal goal. 

I recommend:
Fox Sports Marg
Beers
Grape Bombers",0
"I read the two good reviews here on Yelp, so I was looking forward to a good Italian dinner.  Unfortunately, it must have been an off night.  The waitress didn't want to be bothered and the meatballs and the tomato sauce on the spaghetti didn't have much flavor.  That's the test of a good Italian restaurant for me.  If the sauce is good, they usually get thumbs up.  This sauce wasn't ""bad,"" but it was bland and watery.  Even the bowl of spaghetti wasn't drained properly so there was a dripping, runny mess at the bottom of the paltry bowl of pasta.  This place is right around the corner from my house and Dominic is my brother's name!  So I was really disappointed.",0
"I had not planned on being a Mac owner.  My family - oh so very sick of me constantly complaining of Vista -  on first an HP, then a Dell, packed me off to the Apple store a month ago and well, now I have a MacBook.  The sales associate helping me pick out the perfect Mac was good enough, even with two perfectly good (except for the Vista) PCs at home, to convince me I needed this computer.

Do I love it? Not yet.  I like it, like it a lot.  I'm especially loving not having Vista issues that I had been having.  

I'm enjoying taking the one on one classes  to teach me how to use my Mac.  Each time I take a class - I've had 4 now, I have a different teacher and each one bringing a different spin to my classes.  They are nice, friendly, patient, highly knowledgeable.  They are teaching me so many cool features and applications that I can do on my Mac.  My fave so far is the translator.  I do some business in Mexico - my Spanish is limited - so in just one short month the translator has just been a god send.

The store here at the Biltmore is consistently packed with people, visiting the genius bar, taking group classes or the one on one class and making expensive purchases. I am amazed in this economy just how very busy the store is.  

I'm not totally convinced a Mac is the only way to go (almost though) but this store has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced.",1
"This place has good fast food, it's always clean, and the staff is super nice. SUPER nice. 

My kids love the play area and it's a lot cleaner than any other fast food play area for sure. We love this place.",1
"This is more of a pizza joint for people who have young kids. They have kid games and it gets pretty noisy in here. The pizza is not too bad . If I was craving pizza, this place would not be high on my list but, it was an 'interesting' experience nonetheless. I suppose If I had kids or I was a kid I would probably enjoy coming here.",0
"We were in Phoenix this past weekend for a wedding and wanted a low key, fun, yummy mexican feast before heading for a night out on the town.

Los Sombreros was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and it was great!  We sat on the adorable, sparkly light-lit patio and stayed warm with the help of two heaters.  The place was pretty busy but not too loud.  The margaritas were huge and strong as can be and made just the way we liked em!  We shared an order of guacamole - i was slightly disappointed since other yelpers RAVED about it - i thought it was pretty standard, a little better than ""just OK"".  Both of us ordrerd the chilaquiles (he shrimp, me chicken) and they were fantastic although it would have been great  if our server told us that each dish was a legit 10 lbs! We EASILY could have split!

we had such a fun time, the service was good, food was good and the patio was a great backdrop for a casual, albeit fairly romantic meal.",1
"The food is really good. I can recommend like 5 dishes that anyone would like. If not, try the soup and salad bar. My favorite dish is the Chesapeake Catch, but their Ultimate Chicken Sandwich and California Club Quesadilla are amazing also. The staff works well together and the managers know the value of loyal customers. The GM was GM of the Year before and he wants to make sure every customer who leaves is happy. The kitchen staff is also great.  Keep up the good work!",1
"The new Fry's in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when you're obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If you're in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway.",0
"I have been here 2x since moving down here from cali bay area. I am a coffee snob and I really fit in here. The staff is very cute and helpful.
The people in the shop remind me of the bay area.
I drink americanos and the beans being used are very robust and smooth.
The menu selection is nice for the food fair and I really enjoy the general atmosphere.

I strongly recommend this cafe!!!

"Recently I had the pleasure of eating at this great new Iron Chef Jose Garces restaurant. Pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and I were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us. We were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day, but thanks to the valet service the hotel & restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry! Now I must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant... It was spectacular!! The way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face! Also, it gives you a feel for Iron Chef Jose Garces personality which seems to be light and fun. The food is absolutely amazing!! We split the ""IGNACIO"" Nachos which have black beans, tomato, queso mixto, jalapeño, chile de arbol, and radish, and the Barbbacoa ""Costillas"" berkshire pork spare ribs, chipotle-cider mustard bbq they were tender, juicy, and delicious! We tried the House Margarita the ""Distrito"" and the white ""Mexican Sangria"" both were spectacular!! I have never heard of a white sangria before.. But WOW it was amazing! All of the employees we encountered were extremely nice, knowledgeable, and sincere. This restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list! Thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience!!!",1
"Great place! I've been coming here for quite some time now and every time I received excellent customer service. The servers are always friendly and attentive.

I LOVE the sushi there. They have a lot of fun, new rolls that are unique to Bamboo Grille. The spicy sauce they put on the rolls gives them a great kick too.

Recently I've noticed that the place has looked a little unfinished with random stuff here and there. Baffled, I asked a server and was informed that they are in the process of remodeling. Needless to say I'm excited for the newly designed Bamboo Grille!",1
"3.5 stars. Went to the Calo Flamenco show this past Sunday, brilliantly talented company of dancers and musicians.

The Center just completed a year-long renovation this May, completely refurbished all 1,500+ seats, added guardrails and orchestra level handicap-accessible seating, and enhanced their central A/C system. 

The Chandler Symphony offers free concerts on monthly basis. The Center's programming schedule can be found here:

"I love Sapporo.  They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc...

Their sushi is very good.  They have fun drinks.  

If you make a reservation for dinner you usually don't have to wait.

P.S.  They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!!",1
Pleasant restaurant with a variety of rooms. Farm fresh food is always better than frozen. Great place to relax and talk with your table mate.,1
Wow! Some of the best barbecue in the state!! The pulled pork and the BBQ Baked Beans are a must try!!!,1
"I've heard when better waitresses are there, service is better, but if you go on the night she isn't there, service sucks.",0
We went today after lunch. I got my usual of lime basil and real mint chip (which I love for the real mint leaves) and my hubby got chocolate guiness and four peaks hop knot. Best ice cream in Phoenix! The staff is always super nice. They give us ice bags to take our ice cream home :-)  Love this place,1
"Okay, eating Thai food in what seems to be an old diner is kinda weird.  But after getting off of long flights, my mother and I needed some kind of Asian food and quick.  The GPS was taking us to a sushi joint when we drove by this place and we immediately switched gears.

I give these guys major kudos for the portion size.  Seriously, I felt like I was still in Texas with such an enormous plate full of pad thai sitting in front of me.  And it was delicious--plenty of peanuts, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and they didn't skimp on the meat.  My mom's soup had to be improvised since they'd run out of octopus.  They asked her if she wanted to change her order or just double up on the shrimp and she chose the latter.  Sure, it was tasty, but she was really disappointed.  The fried spring rolls were okay, but they were tiny and not piping hot.

This was a nice way for us to start our trip and the food hit the spot.  It came out quickly and the service was quite friendly (though not quite professional).  I'm all about supporting the mom-and-pop shops and when the kids are working for the parents, I feel for them even more (been there, done that).  With a better parking lot and some remodeling to get rid of the weird diner feel, this place will continue to attract more and more clients.",1
"A short review is in order here because after all we are talking about freakin donuts.  However, in AZ there are no good donut shops for the most part.  We had three donuts - glazed, chocolate long john, and a chocolate old fashioned/sour cream.  The last was a bit stale.  The first two were great.  We will go back.  Nice little place and it's open 24 hours.",1
"It's an upscale casual restaurant with nice decor- 4 star, a quick meal before or after shopping. A quick meal means only if you get good sever plus quick service.

We went to have brunch on Sunday and it was pretty packed in there. After looked at their simple brunch menu, we decided to get Grilled Hanger Steak with Scrambled Eggs, and Cinnamon French Toast with Fruit Compote & Syrup($8.50). 

It wasn't too impressive, the food was just ok- 3 Star. I think you pay more for the ambiance than the dishes. The service was alright- 3 Star.

It felt like you are in the market with chit chat and bargain noise, which i thought it was kinda annoying.",0
"This is my love note:

Yours beers are so delicious, your food is absolutely scrumptious.  I wish I could spend forever and always with you.  If I could just never work and sit inside of you all day eating and drinking, why, I think I would be the happiest gal on this side of the Mississippi River.  You are great, don't change, and please, stay with me forever and always.

I love you to the moon and the stars Handlebar,

Katlan",1
"Friendly atmosphere, cool decor, good iced tea and iced chai, great bagels and tasty cupcakes!  I had some trouble logging onto their WiFi, but my computer tends to be petulant.",1
Great breakfast!  The rest of the menu however is average.,0
Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.,0
"We went here for my wife's birthday, and it's a rare 5-star review for me. They scored on food, presentation, service and atmosphere. We sat indoors - it's a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed. They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors. The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared. And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough. They serve it ""lazy style"" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly. A special birthday souffle topped the evening off. Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion.",1
"I'm not sure how I've missed trying this place, after over a decade of living in the Valley, partly as an ASU student in need of a good hang-over recovery joint. I can't believe I relied exclusively on the IHOP on Apache Blvd, all those years in Tempe. Dammit!

It was packed on the New Year's Day morning I came here with a friend. The service was a bit slow but on par with my expectations for a jam-packed popular breakfast joint on New Year's Day. I ordered a calorie-laden Cajun skillet with scrambled eggs. I'm knocking off a star because the chicken pieces were too dry for my taste. But the rest of the skillet was very good. The service was friendly and professional. Wildcats beware, lots of ASU students within.",1
"5 words....

HAPPY HOUR ON A SATURDAY!!!

Yes, every day actually! from 3-7pm and a late night happy hour too starting at 10pm!! How can that be true??? Well I guess in Arizona they know how to party! $11 pitchers and $3 pints, yes it could be a little cheaper, but hey it is a happy hour every day of the week! And their beer is really good! AND they will give you FREE samples of all of their beer too!!! This is like brewery heaven!!!

To top it off, a group of people came here in Crank or Drank shirts on their first ever biking and drinking tours and this was on their tour for good reason! Their Hefe is awesome, complete with lemon wedges of course, and their Sunbru was so so refreshing on that hot day in AZ! Adriana and I definitely had our fair share of pitchers, along with an order of their beer battered fries and their specialty ice cream cake! Well, that was actually roopas, and just an FYI, oreo crumb crust and Hefe don't really mix......so save the cake for when you are done drinking ha ha

But the waiters here (the ones that don't look like they are 15!!!!!) are helpful and friendly and nice, and you will definitely get carded here, even though literally I actually felt old here since all the girls look so young! Some of them must have had workers permits I swear!

That aside, as long as they can bring me good beer on happy hour prices, I am sold.",1
"Its pretty expensive..  Everything's about 4 dollars minimum but the food is quality.  The flavors aren't very new and exciting, but you can tell the ingredients are quality and they don't skimp.  The texture is good quality.  Love the whole almonds in the rocky road!  :D",1
"i just finished licking my fingers clean and almost ate the dressing-drenched paper that held my very first, and surely not last, lucky boy international burger.

crispy bun, tons of dressing, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions, and a perfectly tender, smokey burger. thick, perfectly salted, crunchy on the outside and soft and burning hot on the inside fries. thick and deliciously sweet chocolate and peanut butter shake.

gone. in less than 5 minutes.

place closes early, so unfortunately there will be no drunk trips through the dangerously narrow drive thru.",1
"I got to stay here for work and had the best time! They have so many pools. I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself. It was great! They let me send free postcards which was fun, too. My room was beautiful. It was large and had great amenities. 

Food was disgusting though. I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week. Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL!

I thought customer service was fine--not great, just adequate.",1
"I don't drink, so my review will not be intoxicated by anything except the building.  I gave it two stars for the building.  They did a beautiful job with the remodel (I'm a mid-century and Haver fan.)  The food wasn't anything to write home about.  I have to admit that I'm particularly tough on restaurants filled with...I don't know what to call them...scenesters, I guess.  Service was ok.  Its not BAD, mind you, its just that I don't get it.  I guess if you're paying with credit cards all the time, you don't care how much mediocre food costs, as long as it makes you feel cool about eating there.",0
"Durant's has that old, musty, dark, Mafia feel. Love the atmosphere and allure. We mainly sit at the bar, but have dined in. The happy hour specials are good, and we have tossed a few back here having great talks and enjoying the ambiance.
Now for the bad: The food is overpriced for it's quality. The steaks look fatty, the salads wilted, and flavor pretty bland. It would probably be okay if we weren't looking at 20 plus dollars per entree. Back in the day, Durant's was very high end and elite, so I could see the pricing from that perspective. However, if they want to stay in the game, they need to keep the food up to par as well. 
5 stars plus for ambiance, relaxation, a throw back feel, and great drinks! 1 star for food and food prices. 
However, a major landmark in Phoenix, so please check it out! We never know how long these staples will be around. I would just recommend going for drinks and maybe split an appetizer. It does ignite the ""romantic mood"" and will leave you reflecting on those ""good old days"".",0
"Run by the Mormons, they keep it really well stocked and organized. I got a couple of cool chairs there, a pair of fake leather cowboy boots, 3 belted pencil skirts, 4 or 5 pairs of chunky 80's earrings, a man's plaid shirt that fits me perfectly, countless other things. It is a thrift store, so there are the usual things that would take away from the experience, but the prices are reasonable and not fixed by item, like Goodwill. I've seen some really nice living room couches, sets, even, but never had a need. At one point, they had 40 or 50 framed prints of the same 5 paintings, one is a Van Gogh floral still life with a green background. I'd never seen it, my mom picked one up, though. 

I am a masochist, so I love to peruse the ""As-Is"" and the yard where they keep a lot of bigger, crappier stuff.",1
Outstanding and fantastalistic comes to mind. Real good.,1
"The food was good but, for the price, there are a lot better steak houses.  For this price point, I would suggest Donovan's or Mastro's.",0
"I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. 

The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say ""sacrificed or as important"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). 

The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, ""don't wear pants,"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly ""cooler"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? 

The answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. 

Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.",0
"Cold, under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I don't think this even meets health code. 

Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called ""fandito."" I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights. 

I like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad.",0
"I've been to this place three times and have enjoyed it every time.  The service has been good.  No complaints.

We really like the thin crust pizza's.  And the salads have been big and tasty.  Spliting one small pizza and a salad with my wife if plenty for us.

We've also had the lunch special of a large slice of pizza and a salad.  Just the right amount of food and tasty.

My wife and I think the prices seem fair for the good quality of the food.

This is now our first choice for Pizza, since we aren't going to drive all the way downtown and wait two hours at Chris Biancos every time we want pizza.",1
"Yes I do rock the hipster joints.  I dig this place.  A little bit of a scene, but the food is solid and the service is great. Hard not like it.  All in all a great spot.  I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602.",1
"This place is a little more fancy than I expected....decor and atmosphere-wise...I thought it would be plain and simple like Red Lobster but actually the place has a very southern homey feeling to it.....although a seafood place they had like deer heads hanging and other sorts of weird decor. 
 
Came here for dinner yesterday night with my bf and his apartment-mate...we got a table right away but even for a weekday they were still half a full house. The first thing I saw on their menu was the Crispy Alligator appetizer. ALLIGATOR! ooooh but then I wanted to try their oyster appetizers cause they sound good too....ahhhhhh their menu is full of yummy choices! It was difficult deciding what I wanted to get...but after much debate....my bf and I decided to order the Oyster Duo appetizer and share the Pappadeaux Platter -- which is an amazing sample platter of all the fried variety they offer on the fried seafood section of their menu. 

So the Oysters Duo -- comes with 3 oysters on half shell baked with a parmesan romano cheese sauce and 3 oysters on half shell topped with crabmeat, spinach and drizzled with Hollandaise sauce. -- oooh they were both delicious however I recommend the later one more just cause it's very unique to this restaurant. I got to also try a few pieces of the Crispy Fried Alligator from our friend's Appetizer Trio Platter - It was pretty good actually tastes like chicken...but surprisingly more tender - I was thinking alligator meat would be tough and rough but not at all....I wouldn't have known it's alligator meat if you didn't tell me. But now I can say I have had alligator meat!

The Pappadeaux Platter was pretty good - everything is well  -- fried! However I like the blue crab cake the most, the mini fried crawfish (kind of like popcorn shrimp) is second best however I have to say that the fried Tilapia was a disappointment because it was sadly bland and really dry...it was the only thing I didn't like on the platter. but everything else was good. - - I even tried their watermelon lemonade and it was super refreshing!

I was really excited for dessert cause I saw them carrying around a platter of sample of the desserts that they have...so when we were ready for dessert I was excited to see the dessert platter - unfortunately there was nothing on the dessert platter I wanted because they all looked really rich and sweet....such as their sweet potato pecan pie, key lime pie, praline cheesecake, praline bread pudding souffle or turtle fudge brownie was just too much even for the eyes..lol They were also massive in portions so I decided not to have any. 

The service was really good, our waitress was pretty quick and friendly. Overall I enjoyed the most of the food (except the fried tilapia) and the service is good so it earned it's four stars. :)",1
"Burritooooooo lunch special!!!!! awesome, tons of chips and salsa",1
"Yummy, fast, fairly priced, and great service! I'll be back!!",1
"This is my favorite public pool in the entire valley.  It's super cheap - 2.25 for adults, 1.00 for kids.  You can bring in drinks and snacks as long as they are not in a cooler (weird).  They have a snack bar. It's very clean.  Oh and the most important part, they have a lazy river, two big water slides, a whirlpool, toddler play area with more slides, basketball, lap pool, diving boards.... I think that's it.  It's quite a drive but it's worth it.",1
"This review will be short and sweet. I promise!

I was able to have breakfast here with the guys as our weekend was coming to an end and it was pretty darn good. I ordered the pancakes with scrambled eggs and extra crispy bacon. YUM! Dennis ordered the Mardi Gras omelet with fruit and I swear the is the second time this weekend he had mardi gras something. The first was mardi gras pasta over at pappadeaux. Hmm I see a theme lol. JD ordered eggs and chicken sausage and let me just say I have never heard the word sausage sound as naughty as it did with these two around. Even our server Steven was blushing by the time we left.

All in the the service was good, the food was good and the company was awesome.  I will have to come back and try lunch or dinner one day soon.",1
"Great beer selecton, and the white pizza is delicious!  Good hang out spot wit sports on the big screen and board games/darts if that's your thing.  

They also have a wide selection of exotic beer for sale.  This is a beer paradise!",1
"I went here last night with my wife to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary.  We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.

I made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.

The place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.

Our waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.

The Food:

* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.
* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.
* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good
* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.
* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.
* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.

All-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.",1
"Come here if you are 

1. a sun devil
2. too young or too old to go to be at the breakfast club
3. want to go to the breakfast club but are too drunk to drive, walk please.

its located downtown, its crowded, its youthful, its noisy, its got decent food, creativity is decent, food taste pretty good.  

u go up and order and pay, they bring the food to you.  the crew is energetic and would do their best to fight thru the crowd to bring your food to you, bring your sauces to you :)  U get your own drink, just be careful not to run over anyone thats hungover.

for old farts like me, this is quite a nice place because it captures some of the ASU campus spirit when you are here.  it kind of reminds U of the MU at lunch time (I am sure its still busy as hell now)

come here, order some coffee, eat an omelette, oh but bring a friend, so someone can watch the seats while the other go order.  its very crowded and mostly first come first serve.  try to limit your party to like 4 or 8 people or 12, u get the idea, the tables seat 4, so if worse come to worse, you can split up to 2-3 tables but still fit everyone in.",1
"Trendy, Current, and a young 20s crowd. You know its trendy when you see all the waitress' in black fish net tights and short black dresses. 

You dine while they play a great music selection with lights all over! Its like eating at a lounge right before the place turns into a night club. Very city-like. 

Come for Happy hour!! I came here with 3 other classmates: Angela, Julie, and Natalie. When they said happy hour for sushi, I was thinking a low key place that was A-OK. I was completely wrong. This place is trendy and hip, which is unlike the suburbia of Mesa. 

During happy hour, my friend and I split the Calamari, Calamari Sushi Roll, chicken wings (6 pieces) and a Margarita, and it came out to $22. Not bad! I like the ambiance, and its definitely something I will be coming back to!",1
"Grew up in San Antonio and Austin. Have traveled extensively and sampled BBQ all over the country. The term Texas-style means beef, first. Period. And good smoke, and that ain't mesquite. Oak is king. These guys have changed the face of Phoenician BBQ forever. It's a shame that the Scottsdale location was touched by ... well, Scottsdale. Friggin morons. If you have not been here, you need to go down to 24th and E. Roeser and try it. Hands down the best Q in the area, including Cave Creek. The guys are FROM Texas and they know the whats, wheres and hows of Bar-B-Que. 

And for those ""the meal in a carton on butcher paper"" snobs who think that such is declasse, please, do me a favor... Head on down to Austin or, better yet, Lockhart. Stand at the front of the line at Stubbs or Black's or Kruez Market and loudly proclaim your thoughts as a BBQ aficionado. Just let me know when you are heading down so I can hang out and watch the ensuing festivities. Freud said it best: BBQ and being horrifically anally-retentive is ALL about your unfulfilled dreams of your Auntie Ma. Or, shut up and grow up ya infantile gomers...",1
"Open 24 hours on week-ends, ample seating area (good for studying or hanging out and chatting), very welcoming clientele, and broad selection of coffee drinks, non-coffee drinks, and desserts, fruits, and random snacks.

The coffee isn't great but not terrible either. The Wi-Fi, while free, is fickle. 

One of my two favourite coffee places in Tempe (other is Cartel off University & Ash).",1
"I really love this gym. It is so nice and well maintained. There is always plenty of towels to grab before a workout.  The childcare is excellent and has the security part down. When you sign up as a member you and your child are given assigned wristbands to use during visits. The staff have always been good about ensuring the numbers on them match prior to releasing my child to me. You can even tune into the cameras to watch your child on the tv's that are on the cardio equipment. Childcare is also open 7 days a week and doesnt close for lunch like most gyms. There is also plenty of group classes throughout the day if you are into Zumba or cycling,etc. I recommend this gym to anyone especially parents needing quality childcare.",1
"This is my go-to pizza joint. I've been here numerous times and the pizza is always delicious. My favorite is the Barro's Special (Pepperoni, ham, onions, green pepper and mushrooms). It's a nice thick and hearty style pizza with a great tasting crust. They have a play area with a little kitchen, legos and TV playing Nickelodean for the kids which is great. They also have ESPN on so I can chill and watch some sports while the kids play.",1
"We've got another first timer here...!

I am just as shocked as the next person that after many years in Seattle, I had never had Bubble Tea.  Gasp!  You can get it almost as readily as Starbucks.  I learned it's also called Boba and maybe one other name.  It's all the same to me.  Same-same.

I had my first boba initiation at the recent Office Hours with Gabi.  I was completely overwhelmed by the options presented to me: what type of chewies (for the record, that term just doesn't seem right), base drink, optional flavorings, etc.  It was a lot for this gal to handle.  Luckily, Alica B. was at my side leading me down the boba path.  

She helped me pick out a concoction of Thai iced tea and regular boba.  Gotta start with the original boba, right?  She ended up with a coffee drink with coffee jellies.  I feel like I'm now ""in the know"" because she asked for the coffee jellies and even though they weren't on the menu, they indeed had them.  That's a little insider's tip from me to you.  Wink wink.  She was so excited I thought she was going to consider this woman the Patron Saint of Boba and commence worship on the spot.

I was surprised to find how incredibly filling boba is.  I wasn't hungry for hours!  Overall, it was good.  I don't see myself craving boba, but if someone wants to go, then I'm in.  I'll check out the jellies in my next go round.  If the craving is boba, I would definitely recommend this place!",1
"I dig this place.  I have only ever eaten here for lunch, but I have been here a kabillion times, and I love it.  The only 2 negatives are the parking and the SEMI-cash-only situation.  Meaning, this place DOES take credit cards if your order is over $25!

A lot of other Yelpers have complained that the male owner is a little rude, and his wife (I think?) is the other owner, and she has always been okay.  I guess I am from the east coast, so they seem totally fine to me, but I can see where AZ people think they're a little gruff.  Whatever... I am not paying them to be nice-- I am paying them to cook me some awesome grub.

The best sandwich, to me, is the Italiano because it's the best prosciutto I have ever had.  The texture and quality makes it melt in your mouth.  Also, you can have this sandwich on focaccia (my friends usually choose this option) or the homemade Italian bread, which is my choice.  It's soft and that dusting of flour just makes me all Italo-happy.  It's served with uber-fresh basil as well.  There is a balsamic dressing that is usally served on top, but I ask for it on the side, as I don't like my bread to get mushy.  Finally, the sandwich is pretty big, so it's worth the $10.  (It's gotta be $10 worth of primo prosciutto alone!)

The other key choice is the pizza.  I departed from my beloved Italiano one day (but only because I had already eaten it 2 days before) and ventured toward the pizza.  I am suprised to say that it's really great!  The crust is perfect, and it's just the right amount of doughy.

My advice is to try it.  Get there at 11:30am or 1:00pm for lunch.  Carpool.  Bring cash.  Smell the air when you walk in.  Order the pizza.  Make plans to go back and try the Italiano.  ;)",1
"Can't go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte, hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife. :)",1
"When I saw this place pop up along the everyday path home, I had such great hopes.  I was counting the days until I was able to hit this place for a nice weekday lunch.

With an such and ostentatious name as ""The Scottsdale Salad Company"", I was oh so stoked about a genuine alternative...  I envisioned crazy vegan vigilance, staunch environmental activism and a ridiculous gargantuan AYCE salad buffet teaming with fresh usuals and exotic fare.  I would stuff myself into lunch coma with all manner of crazy nosh all while maintaining some personal self-image of ""health"" under the guise of a ""salad bar"".  Glorious.

Alas, I was so, so disappointed.

It's basically a shell of a quick-serve Chinese restaurant very slightly skinned to be a basic eatery.  The place was virtually empty at high-noon on a Tuesday.  I ordered the large Parisian Salad and a soda.  I was expecting a freshly tossed salad piled high on a plate with a flourish deserving of the name ""The Scottsdale Salad Co.""!!  Rather, I got a pre-packed romaine lettuce and cabbage bomb in a plastic clamshell.  Oh, my soda was a nice styrofoam cup I filled on the fountain machine.  All for about $10.  Food cost couldn't have been more than $2 even if purchased from Costco next door.  I certainly wasn't paying for the ambiance.  Lame.

A couple people there got a wrap, which appeared to be emaciated and a general poor excuse for a wrap which I'd like to pay money for at a restaurant.  I could make the same lame roll at home for about $1.

As is, this place is simply another ticking timebomb of another indy resturant failure.  If the owners take a risk and venture to be more than service station food, they might have a prayer...",0
"I went out last night in search of a restaurant with good soup, but instead decided to try Texas Roadhouse. As soon as you walk in, you feel welcomed and right at home. The staff are all smiling and welcoming you, and just the atmosphere of the place was great! Roasted peanuts await you at your table, along with some delicious bread! I had a bacon cheese burger, which I could only finish half, while my husband had a steak that he actually enjoyed! Our waitress kept up with the drinks and checked up on us enough, but not to much to where she was bothering. All in all the service and food was great! I will definitely recommend it to others, and be back myself!",1
"Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to 5 stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley. It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good. And they're local. Can't beat it!",1
"Decided to stop by for breakfast by myself one Sunday morning.  The reviews on Yelp were enticing, so I gave it a shot.  I ordered the Sonora Potato and Sausage Hash (Eggs, Potatoes, Hot Links, Chipotle, Garlic, Onions, Peppers) w/side of Sourdough Toast, $8.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nEyREad5GZd3RiEZA-Irpw?select=TKoW6UY1opAaH4wFxLkFpg

I couldn't wait to take a bite of my dish as I love Hot Links and have never seen it in a Breakfast item before....it didn't disappoint, it was very good.  The Hot Link was actually spicy, which is often not the case.  The Potatoes were very tasty as well.  My only complaint was that it was kind of a small portion...I was left wanting more.

My server was very friendly and welcoming.  She asked how I found the joint and addressed me by name when I left....very cool.

Return Factor - 98%",1
"This review is for food-  

On recommendation from the waitress my dinning partner ordered the nutter sandwich, I went for the grilled cheese and we started with the wings.  The wings were not what I expected nor wanted, the sauce killed it for me.  The grill cheese was just ""okay"" and the nutter sandwich that received raved ratings from our server was a huge let down.  We added the marshmallow and bacon (as recommend) but the marshmallow was no where to be found and the bacon with the natural (non sweet) peanut butter with super sweet jam was just.........not good.

But! i do enjoy the space and the selection of beer.  I have had friends who have gone since and rather enjoyed their spam sliders.",0
"I've never eaten at this location; both times I've had it was to-go. The first time I had a pulled pork sandwich, and a side of the beans. The pork was extremely dry and tasteless without the sauce. The sauce I found was overly seasoned. And the beans had way too much pepper. 

The second time I had HB's was a work lunch that we had this delivered. Once again, the pork was completely dry, but not as dry as the pulled chicken, which my coworkers complained about. 

I prefer Hap's BBQ over this place for sure.",0
"My wife and I were having a lousy day and we needed somewhere to eat. We happened to drive past Stax and decided to give it a try. Once we sat down, our moods immediately improved. Our waiter was friendly, funny and attentive, without being overbearing or annoying. I was happy to see a decent selection of beers with a healthy dose of local brews. I immediately ordered an Oak Creek Nut Brown.

Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and glasses of water with cucumber slices. The cucumber added a nice cooling touch on a hot summer day.

We ordered the sweet potato fries and I ordered a seafood burger, which on that particular day was shrimp. The sweet potato fries were excellent, fried just right and lightly seasoned with kosher salt. Even without the homemade ketchup, the fries were a delight.

My burger was tasty, with the shrimp lightly breaded and seasoned with a kicky teriyaki sauce and served on the bun with lettuce and thin strips of carrots. Also, the bun was very soft and tasty.

The only issue with Stax is the price. The burgers are more like tapas, in that they're small (3 oz). But, each burger ranges from $4 to $7, depending on the type of meat. A hungry person could easily eat three burgers, so plan to spend a decent amount of money if you want a large meal here.

Overall, a fun place to grab a lighter bite to eat.",1
"Check this out...I JUST HAD A RUBEN FOR BREAKFAST!!!!! 
I saw the article about this place in the Tempe newspaper. We were already heading to the Healing Field at Tempe Town Lake9/11/10 and wanted to stop for breakfast. We had the dogs with us so choices were limited. My boyfriend went into Stan's and they let us sit on the patio with the pups. 
They serve their entire menu all day. I'm not a huge eggs and bacon kind of person so I love having something a little different in the morning. 
I ordered the Ruben and allowed Kelly the waitress (who was fabulous) to choose the side. 
The food took a little while to arrive. 
When it did...Holy Cow!!! 
My sandwich was huge and she brought all three sides so we could taste them all. That is great customer service! My favorite was the slaw, then potato salad. 
The food was fabulous and the staff was more than accommodating. The owner stopped by our table and chatted awhile. 

I will no doubt be back. Thank you so much Stan's for the wonderful start to my day!",1

"If you like Houston's, this is like Houston's creepy cousin that isn't quite right.  It's Bizzaro Houstons.  The food is just gross.  I didn't like anything about it.  You do get a TON of food...but none of it is good.  I got the pork tenderloin...it was gross.  I ended up sending the meat back and just ate the mashed potatoes with the sauce...that's all I could stomach.  (The prices are about the same as Houston's, however.)  I couldn't believe how packed this place was...no one at our table liked their food.  A few of my coworkers went there as well and there were no good comments about it.",0
I didn't try any food hear but this place seems like it has a split personality. Tons of tvs showing sports so sports bar. At the same time there's a dj blasting club music. There weren't that many people dancing. We went here because the place next door had a huge line. One plus is that theres a second bar near the patio that we stuck by. This place to me was...meh.,0
"Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants!

A friend and I went to lunch there last week and it was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews.  The menu is EXTREMELY extensive.  The b-fast all day long is a plus, but I wasn't in the mood for that this time so I stuck to the lunch menu.  I ended up ordering the half sandwich and soup of the day and my friend and I split a side order of sweet potato fries.  The eggplant and roasted veggie sandwich was really good, but huge and messy!  I ended up eating a lot of bread and then eating the insides that fell out with a fork after wards.  Delicious nonetheless.  The homemade chicken noodle soup was outstanding!  It had lots of other bits of veggies that are not traditionally in the soup (red pepper, green pepper, corn, etc.) and it added to the soup quite nicely.  Did I forget to mention it's a GIGANTIC bowl of soup?  There's no little cup o' soup here - come hungry!  The fries were delicious although we didn't even need them since our meals were ""Hungry Man"" sized.

Some side notes:

1.  Parking is awful for lunch.  If you don't mind creepily stalking folks in the parking lot and possibly engaging in an altercation with another patron attempting to park, go ahead and give it the good ol' college try.

2.  I ordered a water with lemon.  I received a water with no lemon.  When I asked for some lemons for my water, they brought me out a small plate with SIX (yes, I really did say six) overgrown lemon wedges.  I tried to come up with a scenario where one person would possibly have a need for one entire lemon on steroids.  I couldn't come up with one.  There is no reason for one person to be in possession of that much lemon.  Period.

3.  We walked in and staff #1 seated us.  Staff #2 took our order.  Staff #3 brought our drinks and later the pile of lemons.  Staff #4 brought our meal.  Staff #5 cleared our plates.  Staff #6 brought our check.  Staff #3 took our check and brought the receipts/change back.  Did it really take 6 people to get us through a weekday lunch?  I was mostly entertained by it - it almost became a game of ""who will show up next and what is their task?""  It was still a little ridiculous.

4.  Being a semi-health conscious diner, I loved that they had fat free dressings, made tuna salad with low fat mayo, and just had many, many more healthy options than the average restaurant.  I appreciate places that can fix a good meal without drenching it in calories and fat.  There are plenty of places to go for that sort of meal when you're in need.  No shortage there.  It's nice to have those options beyond the standard no dressing, burger wrapped in lettuce, or vegetable medley consisting of zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  A big up for Taylor's.

5.  For a half sandwich with soup, half of the fries, tax, and tip I paid about $16.  It's not the cheapest lunch in town, but it's worth what you pay for.  Just remember that the portions are gargantuan so no need to order a lot of extras to fill you up.

I will definitely be back again.  Enjoy!",1
"Of all the Chipotle's I really like this one.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and I don't think I've ever been in the place, and I've""ve been a lot, where they weren't meticulously cleaning the restaurant with soapy suds.",1
"Lavelle's just opened the end of April. So far I've been twice once for lunch and once for ice cream. Both times I waited about 15 minutes. Understandable considering their new. I wanted to make my own type of sandwich and the older women said they don't do that. Okay. So I wanted to get the arizona sandwich with a different bread, she says the bread change is 1.00. Really?! Sandwich also had no mayo/mustard. All in all it's good to have new restaurants out here, but this one is just okay.

**Update: I have went in on 2 different dates to get ice cream. Only to find out the 2 flavors I want are gone. Should get back-ups of their items.",0
"The only thing that this Krispy Kreme location has going for it is convenient location and a drive through. You will not see any dough-nuts being made here which is sort of part of what the Krispy Kreme experience should be. Seeing them being made; ordering them as they come out so they are still warm for your first bite.

Now then let's consider this review then as if this was a regular dough-nut shop and it also does not stand up. The mom-and-pop  shop I have closer to me makes better tasting ones, but it is probably because they make them right then and there.

I am assuming that they are hauling the ones they do sell here from a different location or a centralized place where they make them, which completely explains why the glazes, etc. taste as if they have been sitting for a while. They are still ok dough-nuts.

The other thing that this place lacks is in the coffee. I ordered a coffee and the person had one of those Super-sized Shamrock farms half-and-half containers and asked us if I'd like some in my coffee and to tell her when to stop. I am sorry but, who puts anything on their coffee without even tasting it first. Not me that's for sure. Worst experience getting coffee here.

Bottom line: The dough-nuts here will not be what you would expect from Krispy Kreme and forget about ordering coffee that will be to your liking.",0
"The cookies and breakfast pastries are to die for.  Just for those two items they deserve four stars.  Everything else, however, is just OK.  The rest of their foods are good but not great.  If you've ever been to Wildflower, I think their food is better there but dang, I can go to Paradise and just pig-out on their cookies!",1
"Recently ate at Macaroni Grill at Desert Ridge, went with friends and drank wine and ate light, just grilled veggie platter with rosemary bread. It was so delicious. The veggies were grilled perfectly, very flavorful, the bread was perfect dipped in olive oil with pepper. We drank the family wine which is the house Chianti you pour yourself. Had a perfect evening, stayed almost 3 hours. Service was excellent!",1
"Located next to T-Mobile on the Southeast corner, the parking is terrible because of the ""always busy"" Paradise Bakery. 

Good prices (about $1-2 less than most other places), quick service, good manicure and decent arm/hand massage, clean place.

I plan to come back try out their pedicure soon.",1
"Things that might happen at Bikini Lounge:

You might watch your friends dance with a bum in front of the juke box.

You might drink far too many pitchers of PBR.

You might throw a fit when you realize it is cash only.

The Bikini Lounge is quite possibly the crappiest place known to man. I mean it's in a shitty neighborhood where you might die, doesn't take credit cards, and has only bags of chips for food. So why do I keep going back? because eventful things happen here. Don't go if you want to have a quiet night with a couple of friends and go home and go to bed. Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes, order pitchers of PBR until you and your friends are all sick, then go outside and forget where you are and turn left down Grand Avenue only to find out you are nowhere near home when you get to the burned down church on 5th ave and monroe and a bum asks you for money. After that, you'll get in a bike taxi/rikshaw and tell the guy you can only pay him in cigarettes and then when he agrees, have him take you to another bar, instead of home, and then you will be further than you were to begin with. When you finally do get home thanks to a caring homeless guy that actually does have money (you find this out because he has a car) and gives you a ride home. You wake up the next morning wondering why all of your cash is gone, how much you drank, and where your friends are.

If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!",0
"I love the layout of this outdoor bar. However, the price of drinks here and the lack of well options is a huge turn off. It's also going to be interesting to see if people are into the idea of an outdoor ""dance club"" once summer comes back around. 

The view is awesome. I'm always up for supporting independent downtown businesses, this place just needs to make some changes to make me want to come back.",0
"Open Range offers some damn-good home cooking. My family eats here often and has never had a bad meal. Not to mention that the portions are huge. 

I usually order the cobb salad. From a typical deli, I'd normally expect iceberg lettuce, a handful of shaved carrots, some egg, and a little bit of bacon. But if that were the case, I wouldn't be ordering the salad again and again. The field greens and romaine lettuce are served with avocado (I'm pretty sure they use at least 1/2 an avocado for each salad), artichoke hearts, tomatoes, bacon (no bacon bits here!), radishes, blue cheese, egg, cucumbers  and I'm sure i'm forgetting something else, but it is GOOD. Sometimes, if I'm really hungry, I order it with a side of their twice baked casserole (twice baked potato in a cup, basically. It's unbelievable.) I'd also recommend the Arizona caviar (black bean salad) or southwest coleslaw.

My dad loves their BBQ sandwiches (with choice of homemade barbecue sauce - each one better than the last), my mom usually orders one of their other great salads with a side of potato pancakes (better than grandma's), and grandpa loves whatever is on special. Even my picky-eater brother loves food at Open Range - and that's saying something!

Bethany and Tom are the owners; Bethany does most of the kitchen cooking and Tom says that he's in charge of most of the barbecuein'. (He once gave my family a taste of some of their freshly smoked pecans and WHOA, they were GOOD.) The restaurant (as the name suggests) has a full service deli too, in case you need a pound of freshly sliced ham as well as a meal.

In the past, the service has been slow, but it has improved dramatically over the past year. The restaurant has a killer view of the Superstition Mountains, and is within 10 - 20 minutes of countless hiking trails. 

To make this long review short: if you're looking for a tastes-like-home (or tastes-better-than-home) cooked meal and you're in the far east valley, make sure to stop in for lunch or dinner. You'll probably see my family and me chowing down too.",1

"Busy right after school which is to be expected...Wasn't very clean which is disappointing, especially for an ice cream parlor. We stopped in to try the new soft serve ice cream with sprinkles that turn the ice cream a new color. Don't know if the boy behind the counter was stingy or what, but the kids got only a couple of sprinkles that didn't even cover the ice cream which was disappointing considering they charge for them. All in all wouldn't visit this location again. We prefer the one closer to home :)",0

"Simply put, this place rocks. CleanFreak has a TON of vacuums, a debugging station, and a fast, very efficient car wash. Best of all, for a mere $17 you can have UNLIMITED car washes. If you have windows, you have probably noticed that it is monsoon season, and monsoons hate clean cars as much as terrorists hate freedom. While I cannot explain why we call monsoons 'haboobs' I can tell you CleanFreak is a great place to wash your car.

CleanFreak has some perks I have never seen at other self car washes. For starters, the employees are outstanding. Somehow they are smiling and seem happy- even in the hot summer heat. They great you and explain how things work, and you get an armor all towel, to clean your interior. As you pull around and queue up for a wash, you are then given your choice of air freshener! Where else does that happen at this price?

I highly recommend checking out the unlimited wash VIP fast pass. There is actually a separate line for people with the fast pass, and how it works is a bar-code sticker is placed on your windshield, and you pull up to the fast pass line, and it scans your pass- and you're in- just like that. This 
saves time, and waiting in line, which is good stuff.

The one thing CleanFreak can do a bit better, is communicating how things are supposed to go. On my second visit, I was getting ready to start through the wash, and I asked an employee for an air freshener. He asked me where my receipt was, and I didn't know what he meant. I asked him what receipt and he told me that if you have a Fastpass, you need to bring the recipt that the machine spits out. I had no idea about that, and explained that to him, and he was cool I think it would save some headaches to either have some more signage, or give people a flyer with an overview of what/how to do things. Otherwise, CleanFreak will take care of you, and for the price of one wash somewhere else, you will have a month of unlimited washes.

Bring it on monsoons!",1
I love this place! My girlfriend and I go here to celebrate special occasions and the staff is so friendly. We sat at the bar last time and the bartender Jesse was so great.

We had made reservations for a Sat night, and when we arrived, we were immediately seated.  Our server guy was friendly, quick and did a great job of attending to our large party.

The ambiance was more relaxed (and less pretentious) than I had expected (considering you're in Old Town Scottsdale), so I appreciated that.  Parking was easy.. not sure how we lucked out on great parking spots on a Sat night in the area, but we did!

The food:
My sister's coconut fish was very tasty.. addictive probably because of the creamy coconut milk and the sugar they obviously added.. still delicious.
My pork lettuce wraps were tasty and I had the option of getting them with red/purple leaf cabbage, which was a nice change.  The meat was savory and seasoned well and my portion was so big, there was no finishing it.
My bro's seafood curry was a hefty portion (as were all the rest of the dishes in our party) but I wasn't a big fan of the flavor.
My hubby's spare ribs were overly-flavored (yes, that does exist) and I didn't enjoy the bite I had.

Im not sure how authentic this Thai food is, but it was tasty... Thai food is quite healthy (yes, I do believe coconut fats are healthy), but all the sugar added for flavor enhancement of the currys is not very Thai.. nor appealing to me.  For a once-in-a-while occasion, I'd go.. but it's not really on my ""must go back"" list, sadly.",0

"Before all of you band together to burn me at the stake, let me explain.  I have a reason for wanting to review a chain such as Del Taco!

I went here the other day and was shocked.  The staff is nice.  And I'm not just talking fake friendly.  They were genuinely kind and seemed happy to be at work.  In fact, the guy at the counter asked me how my weekend was, so in return, I asked about his.  You know what he said?  ""Perfect.""  He said his weekend was perfect.  I can't remember the last time I had a perfect weekend.  Lucky him.

The food is pretty good too and I especially enjoy their spicy jack quesadilla.  My nachos did not come with any cheese though- not sure if that was a mistake or not.  Just chips.  False advertising. 

Anyways, everyone who works there was exceptionally nice.  Why?  This has never happened to me before.  Was I their first customer of the day or are they really just nice people happy with their jobs?  They must pay well there... Is the secret to being happy in life working at Del Taco??",1
"I can't say enough good things about this place. 

Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.

But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my ""recent discovery"" is ""spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze."" That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.

The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it. If you're feeling less risky, you can't go wrong with their mojito.",1
"I decided to give this place a whirl yesterday on my lunch about 5pm from work  the space was nice open airy the staff from front of the house to The wait staff all were very friendly linens on the tables as well as linen napkins the only thing was the menu was a little lack luster the appetizer selection was fair. Hummus,tzatziki  , served w/flat bread ,selection of olives a couple of pork belly selections I had the lamb burger I ordered medium it was served a more rare but was still good the did offer some higher priced entrees and there were other selections of burgers and sandwiches thus the name gastro pub  they had some good beers on tap",0
"This hotel is amazing! The staff is very friendly, it's very  clean and it has wide space for a hotel room, nice swimming pool with a heated pool. They have free breakfast and free dinner:) and it's pretty much near with everything you need: mall, restaurants and bars:)",1
best in the valley,1
"A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch.",1
"I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.

Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.

Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.

Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) 

The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.

They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.

But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. 

So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had.",0
Stopped in looking for some break from the heat after a couple hours shopping.  They have a happy hour menu that we tried several dishes from and all were very good.  Menu also has a good selection of alcoholic drinks nut we stuck to H2O hydration instead.  Staff and management were very attentive.  Would definitely recommend.,1
"I almost moved up to three stars because Nicole, the pianist, makes dining here such an amazing experience, but the food just never is up to par, so 2 stars it is.

I was here with the Downtown Friday Nights (aka #dtfn) crew, and started out with a glass of AZ Stronghold Mangus, which was a delight.

We were noshing along, so I ordered the spinach dip, which was so salty that I couldn't even eat it. Yuck. I asked the waiter to take it back , and he said ""yeah, we've been hearing that a lot tonight""

News flash, if you are getting a lot of complaints, maybe you should stop serving it for the night.

I'm glad I had a friend's cheese plate to snack on...it is hard to mess up brought-in bread and cheeses.

My Florist is all atmosphere and no substance. The space is great, the piano is awesome (she will even take requests by text message, while she's playing)

**Correction....the GM sent me a message pointing out that all of their bread is not, in fact, brought in, but is baked fresh daily. Duly noted**",0
"If you own a car that is older and you want it to look and smell new - this is the place.  Our 3 year old truck looks brand spanking new after these guys got done with it.  We also had them tint it and it turned out amazing ... again ... I say again because this is the second vehicle I have taken to them.  That is the main reason I went back - I could not believe how good both my vehicles turned out.  I had the window tint on the other one for about 3 years before I sold it and still to the day I sold it ... the tint was perfect.  They use only the top quality film, and do quality work.  I will keep going back and sing their praises all day long!  If you are looking for a detail job, or window tint, this is the ONLY place you should be looking!  Check out some pictures I took of my vehicles after they got done..",1
"I would just like to start off by saying that I love egg salad sandwiches. I have probably tried an egg salad sandwich anywhere that serves egg salad. Sacks is BY FAR, the BEST egg salad sandwich (entitled ""The Dali"") I have ever had in my life. I live in North Phoenix and I will literally drive many miles just to eat at Sacks. On top of the wonderful menu, whenever you order a sandwich from them, the meal comes with a little chocolate chip cookie, which is amazing all in itself. If you like their cookies, you can purchase the cookie dough. They also make other delicious dessert bars and salads that are for sale as well. I have been eating here for at least 14 years, and I hope they NEVER go away!",1
Very interesting sweet and sour had kind of a spice to it but good. The pork itself wasn't my favorite but it was good. The rice was very sticky. Unfortunately I had to get it to go so  I missed out on a lot that the great food specials have to offer. But I would def go again.,1
"It's an airport, and what exactly does one look for/expect from such an establishment? Currently I want free wi-fi most. Free wi-fi at Sky Harbor... Check. Secondly, convenient economy parking is a must. Convenient economy parking at Sky Harbor... Check. Not to mention the shuttle drivers are always friendly and small talk-ready.

The TSA folks here also seem to smile and playfully banter with travelers more readily than at other airports. Perhaps this is due in part to Sky Harbor's ""America's Friendliest Airport"" marketing ploy, but in any case it's certainly something to remark about.

I doubt Phoenix will turn into any sort of true travel hub in the near future, but more non-stop international flights would certainly be welcomed. But until the demand is clearly defined we'll have to be content with a few flights to Europe, Canada, Mexico, and the lone wolf to Costa Rica.

I am very excited to see the Sky Train completed and operational with Stage One scheduled to be up and running in 2013. This will allow connections from the light rail and offer a new mode of transportation from the east economy lot to terminal 4.

I've seen previous reviews complaining about having to go back through security when changing terminals, which is actually the case in many airports throughout the world. The terminal is the secure area so whenever you leave it you naturally have to be screened again. There are a few exceptions, but the easiest way to circumvent this is to fly the same airline from point A all the way to point B. If you're connecting at Sky Harbor you should only be flying US Airways/United or Southwest so as to avoid a terminal change. If you're not flying these carriers then you're over-complicating things for yourself and you should look for different routing.

The central location of Sky Harbor makes it extremely accessible for people living in most parts of the valley, which is a huge plus considering the location of other airports outside of their corresponding metropolitan areas. All in all, there's really nothing significant to complain about Sky Harbor.

P.S. The Fox Sports Grill at Sky Harbor is a true embarrassment, not that one should expect a great deal from airport restaurants, but if Kraft Mac-N-Cheese (this is probably a poor example as KMNC provides a perfect vehicle for some truly delicious creations) is far superior to what you're serving, then you should just end it all. Fact.",1
"I have to give major kudos to our server here. We rolled up at 9p per the Yelp listing happy hour times. Come to find out that 9 is the weekday happy hour and Fri/Sat's happy hour doesn't start until 10. We we're okay with this but our server spoke to the manager without us even complaining or asking him to and honored the 9p happy hour because of the Yelp listing. 

Now to the food and drink. 
If you love cheese, their cheese menu was very large. We got several of the cheeses, the Tres Freres was my favorite (non-happy hour item though). The pork empanadas are a must and the happy hour drinks were very good as well. The strawberry sunset martini was very yummy. 

I'd say the happy hour items are where it's at overall. The food was great the drinks were good. Really given their menu and atmosphere I was really surprised that it wasn't more busy. It's kind of sad to see many of the Phoenix area restaurants kind of dead at 9pm on a Friday night. I'm guessing if it were located in Scottsdale that would be a different story.",1
"This is a delicious neighborhood restaurant!

I can't speak to their sushi much because I have become such a fan of other items on the menu. The handful plus times I have had sashimi here it has always been good.

Now on to my favorites! The Asian nachos are a must get. Instead of tortilla chips they use wonton chips. Topped with a yummy cheese sauce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Their guacamole is a mix of avocado and edamame. Yum! Add some chicken and these are super yummy and great for sharing.

During my most recent visit here I discovered they have a new edamame. Bun Bo Edamame. It's very spicy. Too spicy for my tongue but the friend I was with loved it.

Saved the best for last - the Mojo dessert. I am not a big dessert person, but I almost always order dessert here. It looks like a sushi roll. You get rice krispy treats, rolled up with Nutella, ice cream and a brownie in the middle. Delicious!!!",1
"Just a quick update - this KFC shut down just a few weeks ago. 

There still might be someone in line tho...",0
"This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there, so here goes...

Baiz market reminds me of Chicago. There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didn't know of many. If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs, then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs. And, with Al Hana (check out my review for that too) right inside to satiate your hunger, Baiz is numero uno in my book! 

This place is fantastic, the food is fantastic, the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich, is pretty okay too! =)",1
"If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.  Fry's ""dining style"" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best.",0
"I just had a pretty unfortunate experience at Bison Witches in Tempe.  I remember liking this place when I went to ASU but not anymore!  It literally (no exaggeration) took 1.5 hours for our lunch, which was 3 people eating soups and sandwiches.  Our order took 45 minutes to arrive at our table (again, soup and sandwiches!), and several tables around us that had come in AFTER us, got food before us.  I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this, but the server and a guy that appeared to be a manager/owner didn't even acknowledge the long wait time, no apology, nothing.  They weren't even that busy!  Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table, and acted like we were inconveniencing her.  I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave.  What kind of service is that!?  I wish I could say the food was any saving grace, but it wasn't.  Mediocre soup in a bread bowl, less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich.  I will NOT be going back, there's no point!  Save your time and money and hit up another one of the tasty places on Mill Ave.  Trust me, you'll be better off!",0
"Went for dinner on a Sat. night. I made reservations 1 week in advance and when my friend and I arrived to check in for our table, we were handed a pager and told we could go STAND in the bar area seeing as how there was no place to sit and have a cocktail. Not real sure why I bothered to make the reservation. About 40 min later we were taken to our table where there was NO ONE else seated at first for the Teppan cooking.Kind of a bummer. About another half and hour and more people were seated. It's only about 10 pm now and my friend is literally starving. The bar area is a joke. Maybe I just don't go to Scottsdale often enough but are these people serious?? There were maybe 4 guys under 25. The rest were in their mid to late 40's. The women were about the same age probably but wore outfits like they thought we wouldn't know how old they were if we just focused on the sparkly sequined shirt and puffy skirts. Or as my friend said, are these ladies re-living prom night or what?? Anyway, food OF COURSE is so over priced and where you think you might get 4 of an appetizer, you get 2. Nothing real special about this place. Once you look beyond the decor and focus on the ""scene"", service and food-Thanks, I will go to Hon Machi!!",0
"Went here with some friends and the pizza was pretty good. The ricotta cheese and tomato toppings were fresh and clean and very tasty. However, what I remember is a peachy-vanilla-martini which definitely got me a little tipsy, even before I finished it! But I'm also a lightweight. 

The atmosphere was pretty casual and very well-lit. I loved their ceiling-high windows. Their service was attentive and pretty quick. 4 stars.",1
If you are going out for beer than Papago Brewing in the same strip mall is a much better choice. But if you are looking for a true bar with liquor and beer than the British Open certainly qualifies.  Not a huge fan of the food with the exception of the fried pickles. Typical greasy pub fare. Darts and pool tables and a good juke box. Service is usually pretty good every time I've been in there.  Very dark and very much a neighborhood bar.,0
Love this place. Every time I come here its like a high school reunion. There's wonderful people and a perfect atmosphere for drinking.,1
"Service - 5 stars (which is so rare). Food 2.5 stars. 
My husband and I are a little picky when it comes to steaks (we eat Morton's and Mastro's) but we wanted to try a new steakplace while visiting Phoenix and Durant's had great reviews. 
When you get to the restaurant, you walk through the kitchen (pretty cool to see everything) then you're greeted by the host. We came for a pretty early dinner and literally every single person - host, kitchen staff, waiter/waitresses greeted us. The decor is pretty cool - kind of burlesque-ish, all walls are a deep red, there are huge vases of roses everywhere.
Our waiter Fred was awesome!! Very friendly and professional.  I had their vegetable beef soup (good but salty) and my husband had house salad. I ordered the trout with lemon caper sauce which was very bland. My husband had rib-eye and it was also bland which was surprising. Their dessert - trio creme brulee - was the best part of the meal! So from this meal we decided if we want steak, we're sticking with our usual Morton's.",0
"Like they even need another review - they have a solid 5 stars as it is!

Just got back from my first visit to Adobe, and I am beyond impressed. My German Shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays, so I decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side. I knew he didn't have an obstruction or other emergency issue, but I was concerned about parasites.

The receptionist, Hilary, was super sweet on the phone and in person. She was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered, and how much it would run me (and it wasn't an arm and a leg; the office call was only $56). I was very happy they'd be able to see me the next morning, but then she called back not 20 minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in. Even better! 

The tech was very good with Nately's 40 pounds of squirming, and loved on him the whole time. I was also happy they let me help hold him - I've been to vets that called in a 2nd tech, like the owners aren't capable of safely holding their own dog. Okay, maybe some aren't, but I am, and I appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child.

Dr. Newland was AWESOME.

The difference between him and some other vets I've been to?
- Other vets: ""Oh my God, we need to run $500 worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications"", general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated ER clinic, eagerness to run the bill up, very few questions about anything, etc... 
-Dr. Newland:  Super calm and personable. He spent 20 minutes going over everything (Nately's last few days of activity and stomach issues, diet, contact with other dogs, where I take him in public, anything he could think of really), felt his abdomen thoroughly, and said ""Honestly, he's a puppy, they eat funny things, and something probably just irritated his stomach. He's plainly feeling pretty good, so just feed him a bland diet, give him this medication to settle his stomach, and bring a stool sample just in case, so you know for sure he's parasite-free"".  He also dispensed advice for Nately's general care, as long as we were there, about heartworm prevention and  necessary vaccines, etc. I even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in AZ's climate (turns out, not many). I really appreciated that he didn't try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases, and that he is so on his game and scientific/logical about things.

I am very impressed and will be making Adobe my regular vet for as long as possible. If only they treated birds too!",1
"I went out here tonight with a couple of clients.  I had heard some good things about it, and they were from back East, so I thought to myself, ""why not?""  I must admit I was not that impressed with it all.

We came here for dinner.  Started out with some apps, and ordered the Monster Platter.  Complete with ""sliders"" on it that rivaled a Jumbo Jack for shear size, this could easily feed a family of four for a week.  Thank God there were 10 of us.  Most everyone ordered steak for dinner, and most were impressed.  I, on the other hand, was not that impressed.  All I could taste on my steak was butter, not meat.  I almost had to reach for the A1 Sauce, a cardinal sin in my mind with steak, just to make it edible.

Since we all had a round of golf in the morning, none of us opted for the giant 3-liter beer option they had.  But the booze selection, including wine, was quite impressive.  Service all around was very attentive.  And for those of you that love your barely-18 and barely-100lbs servers that Scottsdale is serving up on a daily basis, this is a great place for you.

There were a few people in our group that opted for the bull ride, a nice little touch that gave this place that little something extra to set it apart from the other Old Town places.  All things considered, I don't think I'd head back here.  I can get a better steak at a Chili's-type place, and the atmosphere (comprised mainly of your younger Scottsdale-types) didn't really do all that much for me.

A couple other things of note:  their happy hour only goes until 6:30 (boo!!) but they do have a daily brunch that, strictly reading off the menu, did not look half bad.  I may have to check that out some day.",0
"It's really easy to write reviews about places like D'licious Dishes.  This was my second visit since Petite Fromage sadly closed.  This time, I was with my mother and wife.  We each ordered a sandwich and a side salad for about $7.00 per person.  Everything was really very good.  I honestly think I would have been satisfied with only half of the cuban sandwich that I ordered, but it was so good, I had to finish it right then and there.  My wife and I are moving into a house in the Medlock Historic District, directly behind D'licious Dishes, and we have decided to make this our standing Saturday lunch spot.  I was too full to indulge in their beautiful selection of sweets, but I will be sure to dive into that area on my next visit.",1
Gallo Blanco has the most delicious ceviche I've ever tasted in AZ. Portion size is plentiful and the chips are quality. I love the indie music selection it really adds to the vibe of Gallo Blanco. If I'm in the area I make it a point to visit.,1
"We went there for dinner in April 2011. The dishes are hit and miss, and all are over priced. My wife ordered pad thai, and it was horrible. Instead of the traditional, flavorful dish with peanut and bean sprout, this dish at Flo's is just a salty, chicken noodle. My wife and I both took a bite, we had to send it back. It was not edible. Too salty. Only chicken and rice noodle. There was no peanut, no bean sprout, no pepper, no egg, no ..... Basically, it was NOT a pad thai at all. 

On the upside, my son ordered a sweet&sour chicken, and it was better than most places. They used fresh pineapples.

Based on food quality, ambience, and dinner prices, I say there are tons of other places that are better.",0
"The place was pretty busy when my husband and I visited one night. 
The decor was ok but very kitschy.
My husband and I split the pear salad although the pears were the ones out of a can. 
The special that night was beef cheeks which if you are familiar and like them, they can be amazing. But I could barely find them on the plate because they were drowned in a heavy overpowering sauce.
My husband had the lasagna which was decent and I honestly had more of that then my entree.
For what we had, it was totally overpriced. I could imagine Olive Garden would be just as good.",0
"mmmmm - wine 
mmmmmm - beer 
mmmmmm - well yes, I am a lush and this is lush heaven!  Thanks Bevmo.

Only one not great experience here and it was customer service orientated, let's just say there is a lot to know about wine and just because someone is in flip-flops doesn't mean they want a $5 bottle...",1
"Vegetarian/Vegan south Indian buffet!  Guilt free conscience! What more could a girl want? I am in LOVE with the dosas.  I always wish I had a larger tummy to accommodate all the delicious food. Udupi is proof that being vegan/vegetarian can be tasty and cruelty-free. Humble ambiance, no fancy decorations.",1
"What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.

It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona. 

The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it. 

The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing.",1
"I could see myself giving the Tavern a single star or two, but let me explain. It has a front and back patio, complete with misters. There's a full bar with Blue Moon on tap. The large size costs $4 until 9, I think. 

The reason for 4 stars is that they're dog friendly; a bouncer explained to me how the owner loves canines so you'll see them around often. It gets a bit crazy on weekends. So usually if there's a long line, I'll keep walking.",1
"I have just relocated to Scottsdale and eager to find a great wine bar and/or restaurant with a great wine list...and 5th and Wine was the one place that everyone recommended, so I was eager to check it out!

I decided to check it out one night after work, and asked a few co-workers for some delish food choices to try...the bruschetta was the one to try!

I loved the ambiance, very social atmosphere, nice bar scene and small tables, but they also had another room for tables further away from the bar which was more chill and quiet atmosphere.  I was quickly seated at a nice table in the more quiet area, and could scope out the scene. 

I started with a delish glass of Charles LaFitte - Brut France sparking...which for $9 was a deal and refreshing!

I quickly scanned the menu for the bruschetta and my mouth started to water with the selections.  I opted for the prosciutto/fig/marscapone bruschetta and the standard mozzarella/tomato/basil bruschetta!  Both were totally delicious!  The bread was lightly toasted and a bit soft...not like your typical ""crunchy"" bread bruschetta...which I actually enjoyed more than I thought I would.  

I ordered the Beef Bourguignon Julia Childs' ""Beef, Wine, Bacon, Mushroom Stew"" over egg noodles...for $16.96...again, a total deal and totally tasty!  The beef melted in my mouth and the mushroom and sauce was hearty and flavorful!

All in all, the meal was wonderful, and the service was great - very attentive staff - Jonathan, my waiter, was super personable. I also met Scott Yanni, one of the owners, who came over to see how my meal was...and he was very gracious when I told him that I just relocated here and was very happy to find his restaurant as one of my new favorites!

I will definitely be back for more of their great menu and tasty libations!",1
Went to this place with family for a birthday party and tried various items from the menu.  Wasn't impressed with the food and the quality of the items.  I've had better and will not be back since there are better places to dine at in the valley.  Sorry for being kind of harsh but I am only being real.,0
"I grew up on Empanadas in Panama and I have been hard pressed to find anything close to them in the U.S.. today I found them! 

A perfectly crunchy crust and the beef was beautifully spiced. Usually Empanadas are bland and soggy. They did a great job on these.

I usually don't like rice, but the rice and black beans were wonderful. 

Service was great! I'll be back!",1
"I enjoy ""the BOP"" as my friend calls it on the same level that I enjoy pizza.  It's good, but it's not my desert island bar.  I go here to meet up with friends.  I've never been there on my own because let's face it.  I'm not likely to be caught dead trolling Scottsdale (even non-Scottsdale Scottsdale) by my lonesome.  The atmosphere is cozy and inviting.  Which kinda turns me off. I like my bars a bit seedier.  But if that's your thing then I'm cool with it.  I hear the food is pretty good for English fare, but hey who wants to waste time eating when you could be drinking?",0
"i've been a mojo fan since... well, since mojo first became mojo. when yogurtology opened right up the street from my house, i arched a skeptical brow and decided to give the mojo-wannabe a try. 

*long sigh*

my newfound love of yogurtology has me feeling a little guilty, as if i've replaced an old love with a new one. such is life, i suppose.

the facts:

yogurtology has a wide range of excellent flavors of frozen yogurt that seem to rotate daily. i've seen chocolate mint, oreo, cupcake batter, red velvet, chocolate peanut butter, mango, blackberry, oatmeal cookie and vanilla bean, to name a few. each and every one delish. they also seem to always have at least one non-dairy option available...

the toppings are plentiful and varied. choose from fresh fruit, chopped candy bars, m&ms, nuts, baklava, brownies, truffles, cheesecake, sprinkles galore, ginormous marshmallows and gummy candy... i've never seen so many topping options in one place.

staff are very friendly and attentive. a little TOO attentive for my taste, but hey, i'm the kind of person who likes to be left alone unless i ask for help...overall, they rock!

loyalty punch-card? you betcha. so eat and eat and eat and score yourself some free yogurtology before starting the tasty process all over again.

lick a spoon and feed your grin.

"Love this place!  Been going to this location for years.  The food is always great and the price isn't too bad either.  The only thing I would say is a con is the service.  You never know what kind of mood the server will be in or if they will be attentive or not.  This place is delicious if you're looking for steak, or seafood, burgers, etc.",1
"Love the DJ here! Good music & vibe. The servers are excellent! I love the decor and the lighting of the restaurant. However, food was... presentable but taste wise nothing special.

Love their twist with cucumber water instead of lemon water! Two thumbs up for this!",0

"I was really looking forward to eating here because I had read good reviews. Maybe we went on a bad day. They were very slow but it took way too long to get our food and they screwed up my friends order. I got a chicken, carne asada and fish taco. The Chicken was the best. I didn't care for the carne asada or the fish. Guedos fish tacos are far superior. I don't think that we will return to Elmer's with all the great Mexican food choices in the area. Sorry.",0
"Rude, rude, rude. I will *never* go back to this place. I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night, I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks). When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket, or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes, the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me ""we have signs everywhere."" The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say. Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on, like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY). I went to an ATM and pulled out cash, it wasn't that big of a deal, but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever. I won't ever go there again. Steer clear.",0
"Nice restaurant and hookah lounge.  The service is...as it is in every Middle Eastern restaurant I've been to-t's not bad, but not good; if you ask for something they take care of you, but otherwise they do the bare minimum.  Nice people, though.  I had the best falafel EVER the other day when I ate some late lunch at the restaurant.  The market has a nice selection of hookahs, shisha, and accessories.  I'll be back, for sure.",1
"This place has some great food. I haven't yet found anything on the menu that I don't like instantly. The pizza, the sandwiches, the appetizers, the desserts... all good. Despite this, my favorite item on the menu is definitely the Berry Burst Cider. I haven't yet found any other decent cider in the valley.

Atmosphere: good
Service: good

My only beef: I did once have the jambalaya and that simply left me wanting authentic Cajun.",1
"One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.  Our server ""DK"" was outright rude and horrible, and outright ignored us when she wasn't making us uncomfortable.   As a former waitress of 14 years, I have the utmost respect, patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.  BAD DK!  Otherwise, our Teppiniyaki (sp?) chef was wonderful, the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!   DK needs a different job, more suited to her personallity, like euthanizing kittens or something.",0
"My awesome musician lovergirl wanted to bring me here specifically to see Nicole so we could have some kind of pianist bonding session. Unfortunately, she wasn't playing when we went, but I am thoroughly convinced that she is extraordinary. 

I ordered the sirloin steak salad and mushroom-brie soup. Our server was exceedingly friendly and helpful, and service was prompt. And the food! The soup was worth the visit in itself. It was creamy and mushroomy, and oh so delicious. The steak on my salad came out a little rarer than I would have preferred, but I still enjoyed it, and it was a huge portion at that. I love that my salad wasn't over-dressed, and I was definitely a fan of the candied walnut-blue cheese thing going on up in that sucker. So good.

Besides the fact that they serve great bougey food, have incredibly witty and awesome wait staff, and sometimes have half-off bottles of wine, I totally fell for My Florist Cafe's atmosphere. We had a late dinner here, and the whole place was lit in cool blue. It felt very accessibly hip. This is a place I'd definitely come back to. You know... the next time I'm in Arizona. I'm actually very much inclined to visit the Ventura location, which is only about one hour from my home plate--as opposed to five.",1
"I give this place NO stars. They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY! The rest of the bar is typical with darts, pool and poker. The food SUCKS! don't bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long. I know that is harsh but the co-host really is nasty.",0
"Atmosphere good.  Food...not so much.  I recently ate here for the first time and, unfortunately, I can't say anything good about the food.  I ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich and expected a hot middle eastern sandwich filled with flavorful chicken sauteed with onions and spices and accompanied with crisp fresh veggies.  What I got was FAR from what I expected.  The pita bread was your typical crappy faux Wendy's style doughy flat bread 'pita', not a regular pita pocket.  Inside was some flavorless, cold, unseasoned chicken (and when I say flavorless I mean indistinguisable from a mouthful of cardboard).  They didn't even bother to put basic salt and pepper on this sorry meat.  The remainder of the sandwich consisted of raw zuchinni (WTF?!), chopped tomatoes, 3 leaves of romaine lettuce, and some bits of red onion.  None of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned.  Oh, there was also some hummus/tahini 'sauce' mixed in there (presumably for flavor), but I have never tasted anything so flavorless.  I imagine that wall spackle has more flavor and pizazz than this 'sauce'.  Come on Paisley, does your cook even TASTE what comes out of the kitchen?  Add some flavor to your food.  You could start with salt, fresh lemon juice, garlic, pepper, and high quality olive oil.  It's really not that hard.",0
"This place is a nice little change-up from the usual mall/Target/splash pad destinations that summer requires.  We have an 18 month old son that loves the noodle forest and the tricycle area.  The place has so much going on it is easy to focus on different things even if we go once per week.  The price is high if you don't get a membership, it pays for itself just in summer visits and then the rest of the time is icing on top.  I admit to enjoying climbing around in the big maze in the center of the museum, that made me feel like a kid again.",1
"This place is great! I really appreciate the extreme friendliness and kindness of the employees. Best customer service. Also, the variety of favors is fantastic!",1
"Ok, they should be happy that I am understanding of the flying bug that landed in my dessert and died before it was served.  Yes, I found it as I was eating the dessert, grossed me out, but not necessarily their fault.  The manager came over and apologized and took the dessert off the bill and offered me another one.  Anyway, the rest of the meal was great.  My party and I had the scallops with green beans and capers.  Yummy!  I do like Pappadeaux's overall and this is the first time I didn't have a great experience.",0
"It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately. 

The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.

Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive.",0
"There is nothing special about this place to speak of, hardly a place I'd seek out to go to again. It's in the heart of Old Town, but doesn't feel Scottsdalian at all.

 I guess it's an OK place to hang out, they have a patio and a cozy interior, (like TT Roadhouse's decor but bigger, and not as cool)  I thought the choice of beer was lacking, the service slow and obnoxious. I fell like I was bothering the bartender by ordering drinks. I really haven't had that experience too often in Phoenix, in Boston every bartender is annoyed to serve you, so I am used to it, but this is Phoenix damn it!  One guy in particular just stood behind the bar with his arms folded, I am not sure of his ""role"" in the whole bar tending process. He didn't even pick up a glass, just stood in defiance of the customers. 

Overall, this place is decent, but I wouldn't choose to go again, I met some friends here and we proceeded to go elsewhere after.It seems as if the Coach House is meant to be a place you meet up have a drink, then bounce to someplace else. I kept wondering, where are all the fine leather couches, and handbags...LOL! ;)",0
"I really like this place... they have great wine... try the tasting... it is 10 bucks and you get 5 tastes... they make almost all of the wine in house (i know the almond champagne is not made there)... i have not found any wine that i don't like... my favorite is their porto and chocolate port.

the other thing you can do is have a bottling party.  i recently purchased 30 bottles (at a great price!!!  cheaper then the wine stores).  they make the batch for you and then you have a party to bottle and label it.  this is a great and fun different party for you are your friends.  

despite it location it is a great place for a date...",1
"Had lunch with my Husband here today, we sat outside, it was gorgeous weather, the food is really Great, good variety, of ethnic foods !!!  Not bad for the price !!!",1
"I went to this place with a family member upon their recommendation.  

The salad was amazing!  I forget exactly what it is called (cowboy chopped salad I think?) .  Firstly it's gorgeous (comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors; arugula, tomatoes, pepitas, dried currents, chicken, asiago cheese, and dried corn for some crunch)  Then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress (a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it), and it all gets mixed together.  

I believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it. 

The rest of the menu looked amazing too, but I'm not sure I could go there and not get the salad.  So I suggest going with multiple people, splitting the salad and then splitting another entree.  

The decor of the place could probably use a little sprucing up and it's a bit on the cheesy side.  

Service wise was unfortunately not the greatest experience.  It was a slow time and we had a hard time getting our bill or being asked if we needed anything else.  Thus the deduction of a star.  But I would still give it another try just for the food.",1
"Known as ""The Jewel of the Desert"" and the ""Grand Dame,"" this beautiful hotel is the only one in the world with a Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced design.  The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright.  Hence, the main restaurant's name is ""Frank and Albert's.""

Celebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history.  Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.

When visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly.  A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance.  For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet.  The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless.  I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.

So, my first experience was our dinner at ""Frank and Albert's"", formerly known as the ""Biltmore Grill.""  Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes.  From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner's Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference.  The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods.  The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their ""bloody rose"" cocktail.  I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail.  However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices.  Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.  

Next, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla.  The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property.  It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge.  

Although our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies.  We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.

The room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well.  The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern.  The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins.  Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in.  A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7.  Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar.  I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner.  The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets.  Silky soft...

We enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.

The next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge.  Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day.  We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool.  We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.

Recommendations:
go to biltmore's website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.

if you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.

About Ocatilla:
basically an upgrade with your stay. For an additional $75-$100/day, these are the following amenities you will receive:
complimentary beverages, wine, beer, breakfast, light evening fare, and desserts in the lounge
business center (computers, internet, printers)
Wii rentals 
pressing service and shoe shine
therapeutic turn down bath
neck and shoulder massages every thursday

"Sauce is my kind of place.  Great, inexpensive food, casual yet trendy atmosphere, perfect location.  

Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.  

If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well.",1
"I can't help but feel the same sentiment as Nathan S. - I sort of feel bad giving this place only 3 stars with all the other rave reviews.
 
Let me start with the positives - 
 
I love love that the place is so small and intimate.  Especially in comparison to most Valley restaurants that are just cavernous.  And with the European-style seating you have to get friendly with your neighbors.  Both of these things make this feel like a good NY restaurant.
 
I also love the atmosphere and decor in general.  Very authentic Spanish, very laid back, not all hip and modern like most restaurants try to be these days.
 
The service was extremely friendly, from the hostess to all of the waiters and waitresses and bus boys that came by.
 
My husband really liked the Sangria (Tinto) - he said it wasn't very strong but tasted great.
 
Indeed, all of the food tasted very good.  Our two favorite dishes happened to be the daily specials - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard dessert.  But the Tortilla Patatas and the Gambas and the Spinach with Garbanzos were all great as well.
 
Now to the negatives - 
 
Firstly, selection was dreadful all around.  The wine list was very minimal, and the very limited bar didn't help.  And there were only about 8 dishes to choose from.  When I go for Tapas, the whole point is having a wide variety of small plates to choose from!
 
Every dish was DROWNED in oil.  Literally, bowls of oil.  The food just sat in my stomach afterwards, and I felt like I needed to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease.
 
The sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent.  I know it's tapas, and I love me some tapas, but generally at tapas places I find you could likely split each dish three ways.  The Gambas and the Spinach were both huge piles that could have been split up to 4 ways.  But then the Tortilla Patatas was barely large enough to split two ways, and then our two favorite dishes - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard - were both smaller than a deck of cards and splitting them just two ways left us each with a single forkful of food.  There was a party of 4 next to us that put in 1 order of the Pork Tenderloin and the waitress said, ""You should really get 2 or 3 orders of that so everyone can try some.""  3 orders for 4 people to try it?!
 
Then, right along with the food size is the price.  $90 (incl tip) for the 4 tapas mentioned above, plus a glass of sangria, 2 glasses of wine, the dessert, and an espresso.  2 of the tapas were one bite per person.  Yikes.
 
The food, while good, was nothing outstanding.  There was no dish that made me stop and say ""wow, now that is well done.""  They were solid but not amazing.  (As opposed to the Lomo Embuchado at Cobras y Matadors in LA that I was ready to marry and make babies with).

So all in all, I'd say a 3.5 star experience, rounded down because it just wasn't a 4 for me.  I can't help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley, Sol y Sombra in the DC Ranch, where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine (and a full bar) and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price.",0
"Saw a show here last night. Stage is raised to a proper height, acoustics are pretty decent and the sound system is adequate for live acts. Three trapezoidal speakers flown above the stage provide good coverage and nice clarity. There's a couple of subs tucked beneath the stage. They have some moving lights(mirrors move not heads), and some LED par cans. Monitors are on the stage floor, and are JBLs so they seem decent. If it were up to me, I'd toss about 12 more cans on the front wash and add some side wash. They have the trussing to do it .

Staff is attractive, and friendly. Knowledgeable about the area and eateries too. There's a patio where you can smoke outside, and they have heaters so you don't freeze your *** off. Drinks are reasonably priced for Scottsdale - and they had some good specials last night which ranged from beer to cinnamon whiskey to vodka - so your bases should be covered.

I'd go back. Go early, or good luck parking. Also - note that last night was Christmas week, so even though it was Wednesday tons of cops were out and about, pulling over all kinds of people as they left Old Town Scottsdale. So word to the wise - Don't Drink and Drive.",0
"Food Truck Fav right here!

I've been wanting to try Pizza People's Pizza for a while now.  I found out they were setting up at 180 Degree's Automotive and I figured if Bogi was hosting them then I needed to check them out!  I finally caught up with them at Local Fest.

Bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was $8 but she assured me it was yummy!  First of all $8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal!  Secondly, Bogi said they were her some of her best friends in the world...and I trust her implicitly....so I ponied up my dollars and waited about six minutes.  I ordered my pie with pepperoni and fresh tomato.  I took it back to my table to share with my Mama (who is also gluten free) and we both said at about the same time: "" Oh, my gosh this is really good!""   Something I've only said about twice since eating gf pizza!

The sauce is fresh, the dough was the best gf dough I've had to date and the toppings were just divine.  I need to put a GPS tracking unit on this truck so I can track it daily! (Oh, wait.........I can just check their facebook page!)  Yeah, I'd eat it daily!  It's that good!",1
"I'm so sad I didn't discover the Herb Box sooner. I went for a girl's lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter. I can't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me. The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly! They're amazing and you'll get tons of them. The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in. 

If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms, give Herb Box a whirl. It's got the same feel, but more modern. Love love love it.",1
"I went here on a pub crawl after being turned away from an overcrowed Majerles during one of the Cardinal's game. I was surprised to find the place nearly empty when just down the road Majerles had people falling out the door, but after ordering a few round of drinks I soon found out why the place was empty. The bar tender and manager were annoyed by the size of our group. When most empty bars would probably embrace 25 people walking in the door wanting to order drinks, the Stoudemire's staff seemed overwhelmed and annoyed.  The restaurant is nice and clean, and the drinks were good yet overpriced.  I would defnitely not reccomend it for large groups.  For people looking for a good sports bar downtown head to Majerles because the patrons there seemed to be enjoying themselves and the staff seemed to enjoy having business.",0
Brie and Apple with Fig bruschetta....I dont need to say anything else!!!!  (except $5 glasses of wine til 5 all week and $5 mimosas til 5 on the weekends)  Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon,1
"Very friendly staff, cute decor! Small, but don't let that fool you, best sandwiches ever!! The egg salad sandwich was so good, it reminded me of the egg salad I enjoyed as a kid! Their potato salad is made there and soo yummy!! Talked to the owner and she was very nice.",1
"Fantastic find for delicious, healthy food and good service!! 

A local friend said that they'd heard good things but hadn't been yet. They asked us to check it out., so we went for a late lunch mid-week and it was still jam packed (30 minute wait) at 1:30 p.m.. We sat at the bar and received terrific service. The fish tacos, steak tacos, bison burger and desserts were all delicious.

It is an open-air style restaurant where you can see into the kitchen. All ingredients are super fresh and the culinary quality is extremely high given that they can make even the healthiest things taste wonderful. I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a healthy food alternative.",1
"With regard to AMber W.'s points

1. I'm rating the food not the containers or the owners
2. If it makes you feel better eating subpar food because of the American Spirit so be it. Others of us are more concerned with the food itself.
3. I'm not downgrading it because it's not a sit down restaurant. Even among non-sit down restaurants or ""fast food"" style Indian themed eateries, this place is subpar. I've eaten at quick Indian eateries and they are much better than this.
4. My review is for people who understand and can appreciate good Indian food. It's not for people who value text service, nice containers and chatty owners.
5. I want to support mom and pop and locally owned restaurants but I also want to support good ones and not encourage bad ones to emerge simply because there is no competition for Indian themed restaurants here.",0
"I adore all of Joe's restaurants. That being said, I think this one is my least favorite..(which means it's still better than most of the restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in the greater Phoenix area.) 
I got the chicken sandwich and it was okay. I think I could have found something on the menu that I would have enjoyed more, but for some reason I wanted to try it. I think I'll have to try the pizza next time, because it looked amazing. The service and atmosphere were great, as per all the Joe's establishments. 
I wasn't completely fond of standing in line for awhile to get a table and order my food. Sometimes I just want to sit down at a table and have the server come to me after a long day.
That being said, I would love to try this place again...especially for breakfast!",0
"I don't eat a lot of pasta and I don't come here all the time.  However, I think the salad with pesto dressing and the garlic Mizithra (spaghetti with bacon, mushrooms, brown butter and cheese) are very good.  I have heard that the other stuff is good, too.  I have only been here for lunch, so I don't know what dinner is like. 

Sit in the trolley car -- you can ring the bell!

It is located conveniently off the light rail stop at Central and McDowell, near the Phoenix Main Library.",0
"I do love Chinese food, and for such a big city I find that Phoenix (or at least Scottsdale) lacks in options, either because they aren't the most welcoming of places, or simply because there aren't that many (compared to sushi restaurants for example. I've been to this location maybe 3 times since moving to Phoenix (8 years ago) and must say that I usually go because a friend as a ""Pei Wei"" craving. I found the food to be ok, but I'm typically one who doesn't like spicy food as I find it takes away instead of enhances the flavor. I wasn't too hungry and decided to take the chicken fried rice. I have to say that my favorite chicken fried rice is the one from Tottie's in Scottsdale that not only is delicious but always gives me left overs for lunch the next day. Portion was ok though the fried rice was a little sweet and the person I was dining with had the chicken lettuce wrap which wasn't too bad either. Service was disappointing as our food took about 10 minutes to come, but I must say the staff was helpful when I was asked where to get takeaway boxes as well as a takeaway cup. I'd give it 4 stars if after a handful of experiences I had Pei-Wei on my ""must have"" list but with Pita Jungle, Sack's , Subway, Rubio's, etc. nearby, the competition for ""fast casual"" is stiff and Pei Wei just doesn't cut it for me unless I really had a craving for Asian food that day.",0
"Sprouts is great, they have a wonderful selection of fruits and veggies and their sausage is made in house and really wonderful on the grill!  The grab and go meals are perfect for a quick dinner and the sandwiches and soups are spot on for lunch.  Very friendly and helpful staff.",1
"I've been here a number of times and the food is always good.  They have a fantastic selection of cheese and it's a great place to try boutique cheeses.  

The current rating is due to the service we received last night.  The hostess was very friendly but our waitress was sorely lacking.  After our food arrived and two in our party still needed silverware, we informed her and she never returned with silverware.  We ended up stealing it from a neighboring table.  She made a bleak attempt at humor telling us that one of the cheeses was a water-based calorie-free cheese when we're pretty sure it's a triple cream.  If she'd had an iota of personality, the joke might have flown.  But, it fell flat and left us confused wondering if we'd really just ordered calorie free cheese.  

We enjoyed our evening anyway.  The service could just use a little work.",0
"I don't see what the big deal is. When I went the soda machine was broken, and the food was bland. Didn't really think the fries were anything to care about. Very sub-par, and more over, just because they give you all you can eat, free peanuts, doesn't mean you should pay so much for a burger or hot dog. Not worth the money, not worth the trip in my opinion. Wouldn't return, wouldn't recommend.",0
great place to go and the pizza ia great too,1
"Where else can you go in Chandler the will transport you to another country for free in a flash!!

I like to shop here and explore the foods of other countries.  This is not just an Oriental Supermarket, they are a World Market.  Each aisle jets you to a different culture or country.

I wish most of all their sake selection was better but oh well, they are bound by the limitations of their distributors.

I will be there again soon for a mini-staycation!!!!",1
"Seriously need a remodel, but totally worth the money due to the free 24hr shuttle in a 5 mile radius!! Nice staff. Clean. Just worn down a bit...",0
"A great place for group celebrations, Fajitas serves up its signature dish in 1/2 pound increments, including chicken, beef, pork, shrimp and vegetarian. Served with sides-- lettuce, salsa, cheese, pico, etc-- and warm tortillas, the fajitas always taste great. There's little reason to stray elsewhere on the menu, other than appetizers and additional sides.",1
"It usually takes a good word of mouth review from a friend for me to try a new Chinese restaurant. However, I was craving this cuisine and this restaurant is close by and tucked away in a small quiet strip mall. Wasn't busy at all on a Friday evening. We were greeted right away as we entered into the clean, open, no frills dining room. We ordered beef and broccoli, chicken fried rice and lo mien. As we waited our super friendly server offered bowls of egg drop soup on the house. The soup was a nice touch but nothing superb. I was satisfied with our meal but it was not the best I've tasted. Fried rice was a little bland. Beef and broccoli was delicious. Overall I'd say the service was way better than the food.",0
I'm usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.  Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly.  For the size and price - order multiples.  Love the salsa bar.  Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat.,1
"Gotta get the hot wings! They'll make sure you know what you're getting into, but even if you haven't had them before, just play along. They're worth it.",1
This Pei Wei is consistant with it's orders being correct & clean. My one wish is that the parking lot it shares with Starbucks & Sidebar were about 15 cars larger. I don't see that happening but a girl can wish can't she?,0
"I came out here Halloween to party, since everything place on Mill had a line we just picked this one place to party for the night. Drinks are cheap, I was shocked at how low the bill was at the end of the night after buying rounds of drinks until our party got their buzz on, but maybe its just me used to Hollywood prices. T_T Out in LA you get used to paying for parking, cover and then exorbitant prices for drinks.  

I love their signature cherry vodka drink, its tasty! Its kinda like a Shirley Temple?! Service at the bar was quick for the amount of people there. Plenty of room for dancing which is always a plus.",0
"As a previous reviewer stated:  ""This restaurant is like no other"".  We had a birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better place to eat.  

First of all, the service is second to none.  Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.

Now for the food - fantastic!  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful, although the portion was a bit on the small side.  But, in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.  For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry ""shooters"" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!

We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.  The total was $169, including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.  I can't wait until the next birthday celebration!",1
"Cherubini is a clean, comfortable coffee shop.  The employees are friendly, but  no more than every other coffee shop I've been to.

I had a decaf drip coffee, which was just o.k.  Nothing to complain about but not particularly noteworthy.

I sampled 4 donuts...raised with maple, cherry iced cake, blueberry cake, and sugar raised.  The donuts were about average or a little higher.  Better than Dunkin but nowhere close to BoSa.  The cherry iced cake was the best, but all the donuts seemed a little too sweet.  I'm a donut fanatic, so I don't mind sweet...but these, just a little too much.

Kudos for keeping up a good appearance and free Wi-Fi, but I won't go out of my way to visit Cherubini again.",0
"I heard about this little gem earlier in the week, and after looking at the menu online and reading some reviews from fellow yelpers, I decided I would try it out. The restaurant was very clean and I enjoyed the music playing, but I think it could use a little more color in the dining room. I was greeted upon entering and was asked if I had been here before. The waiter was very friendly and took the time to explain some of the dishes to me. I asked about the pof pof and he explained that they are like donuts, but better. I passed on them. I ordered the jerk steak over jolof rice, a meat patty, and plantains. First came out the meat patty. The pastry tasted like cornmeal to me, and not flakey like I had hoped. The filling was quite good and just enough spice without going overboard. The steak was very tender and flavorful, with a little bit of heat. For the price, you get your money's worth and I'll have enough left-overs for tomorrow's lunch. Before leaving, the waiter gave me a complimentary pof pof, and in my opinion, it was better than a donut.

I'll definitely be going there again.

"It's the place to be. 

I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle. Having heard great reviews about the place, it's food and the vibe... I had to try it.

Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.

My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal. 

We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had, which I believe.

Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back.",1
"So the food at this place is good. Well the sliced turkey sud. But when it came to delivery and internet ordering. Oh my god the incompetence of these people. After and hour, 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.) I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25%. But the foods not ready yet, how long does it take to make 2 subs. So i pick up the goods and damned if i didn't check the bag they didn't give me the 2nd sub. Ugh they never checked the order. If you have online ordering  you need to follow though. So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat. The only good thing i got was a free lunch.  For that I give them a 1",0
"Great place for a ""home office"" morning. One of my favorite places - indoor & outdoor seating. Always busy - they offer breakfast & lunch, their food is awesome! Very generous portions.",1
"I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight. First time at Switch. Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto, marinated chicken breast, Mac n cheese. All delicious!  

Next my wife orders the blackened salmon. I looked at her with my wtf scowl. We don't even eat seafood. ""It looks interesting"" she says. Whatever. It gets to the table and it's the biggest hunk of salmon I've seen. We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top. 

We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night. 

I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod. Got home, plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert, danced with my dog and made me a latte.  Perfect night.  

Thank you Jason and Switch.",1
"I knew when I was heading to Papago Brewing that I was going to get some good beer. What I didn't expect was some pretty decent bar-style thin crust pizza as well. 

My table ordered the T-Rex, which is basically loaded with every pizza topping made from a pig. My friend was in from out of town, so I said F it, and ate plenty without worrying about it. The pizza was thin, crisp, greasy and delicious. It was everything bar-style pizza should be. As for the beer, I got to try a few of Papago's own brews that I hadn't tried before. Their beers are either very flowery or have a bold coffee bean kind of aftertaste. Good stuff all around, but go with some of the other beers on tap if you're looking for a classic tasting brew. 

Although the food and beer were good, the service kind of sucked. The server was helpful for sure, but he was all over the place and the food took a very long time to be served. I'm not sure if they were short-staffed the night I went, but if the service was more consistent, my experience would have been better. 

That being said, Papago is still a pretty great little spot. I'd definitely head over there again the next time I'm in the mood for some pizza and their beer.",1
"A friend of a friend recommended Lou/Autoplex and I couldn't be happier.  Lou provides honest, fast service and is a pleasure to deal with.  No runaround, no nonsense, honest auto service.  Extremely difficult to find these days... I went to him for a muffler/tailpipe and then later for a catalytic converter and was completely happy with the outcome.  Additionally, he pointed out other things that I should see my previous mechanic about that they needed to fix/finish.  :)",1
"Dined here for the first time tonight. The food was..A-OK! Certainly not authentic Mediterranean food but I don't think it is trying to be. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the loudness.  Way. Too. Damn. Loud. From an acoustician's standpoint, all the hard surfaces and the cavernous dining room make for a very loud joint. This is a big minus in my book.

On to the food!  We ordered the beef gyro sandwich.  Very average but tasty nonetheless. Checked out the lentils and rice salad served warm over a bed of lettuce and veggies with dressing. Sadly, this was a bit of a miss for me. The rice was quite mushy and just didn't stand up to the heft of the lentils. The taste itself was quite fine but I couldn't get past the texture. Also, if you order this dish, know that the grain/legume level far outweighs the veggies. A huge portion (which is great for the pocketbook) but beware if you're watching carbs. The salad below was actually refreshing but all in all, the dish just wasn't for me. 

Also had the dolmades which were quite nice served cold (albeit a little overstuffed for my liking).  Our server was very good, very accommodating with special requests.  Service was a bright spot for sure.

Without a doubt, while I didn't LOVE the food here, it was tasty enough for me to come back again and give it another try!",0
"My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant, certainly longer than I can remember, and at least for the adult portion of my life, which is why it pains me to write this review. 

For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but. 

The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait. 

Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days. 

I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me. That's shameful.",0
"Place is awsome.  Got the beef cheesesteak and everything was great.  The bread was possibly the best I have ever had.  Price was pretty good.  Just over 9 bucks for a whole sammich and soda.  While waiting I walked around and I plan on going back for some shopping.  Lots of pasta, sauces and just about anything you could want for Italian food.  5 stars all the way.",1
"Great spa... If you don't mind spending a few bucks, this is the place for you. Neat water fall room, roof top pool, and eucalyptus room! I've had multiple massages here & they were exceptional. Outstanding customer service too.",1

"MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  I've been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimi's in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimi's quality still existed, they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant.

Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on.

Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______.

I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with ""seasonal vegetables"" and ""homemade mashed potatoes"".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  That's a feat.  My ""homemade"" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress ""the problem"" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling.

After all this, they sincerely asked us if ""everything was all right"" and ""would we care to order dessert"".  At least they have a sense of humor.

Never again.",0
"Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  

Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.

Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( 

Entrees.

Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) 

Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. 

Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.

Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: 

Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)

1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.",0
"Ok... lets review this Walgreen. They sell drugs, and cigarettes. All they need to add is sex and rock 'n roll and they would have it all!  :)

I never really understood how a ""drug store"" (aka a place that one would think is interested in your well being) (they even have a health clinic in this particular location) could sell so much stuff that is really bad for you. 
 
Time to get off my soap box. 

I am not a overly big Walgreen's fan. I hate that they do not do the $4 generic prescriptions like many other large pharmacies do. 

There also ALWAYS seems to be a long line at this particular location when picking up medication. Nothing like standing in line in front of the ""health clinic' full of sick people waiting to be seen by a ""health care provider"" (aka nurse), waiting to pick up my 3 month supply of Viagra... and a six pack of Walgreen's Brand Beer for $1.99. What can I say... I am a cheap drunk!",0
"I have been to this Mojo fro yo location several times now and really enjoy their yogurts! The yogurt tastes great, is light and refreshing and somewhat healthy if you avoid all of the chocolately/candy toppings yet they offer tons of fruit options. Priced by weight, a great stop after retail therapy at Saks or dessert after Stingray Sushi or True Food at the Biltmore. A must try, plus they have punch cards for free fro yo after a couple of visits! :)",1
"I really wanted to like this place, but the service just ruined it. 

I went on a sunday afternoon, when it really wasn't that busy. I was sitting directly at the bar and still got poor service. The server walked by probably 5 times while my glass set empty before she made eye contact with me. It was a bit ridiculous. 

I feel like the yardhouse had just as many (if not more) taps, with the same prices and better service. 

Great decor though, very tall open ceilings and lots of TVs. Just don't expect good service.",0
"Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner, love Wildflower. For breakfast the stuffed french toast is awesome, lunch any of their sandwiches are good. I don't really care for the salads but I love the Potato cream cheese soup. The ice tea is so good and the desserts are wonderful. My favorite thing is the Salmon Alfredo, that they serve with yummy garlic toast. 

I like the order at the front and they bring it to you, very convenient and I don't have to tip!",1
"We have been taking our dogs to All-Star since they opened. The staff has always been great and remembers our girls by name, and the Vets are fantastic! Any Dr who will get down on the ground and love on my doggies is ok in my book. They have squeezed us in for emergency visits many times. We have also boarded our dogs here and they take awesome care of them. Just wish they were opened on the weekends",1
Ive eaten here twice and I dont think Ill ever eat here again. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible BO. It made me so nauseous I couldnt even eat it. The salad is decent but I still cant get over that smell!,0
"If you have to be some place on time, don't use them.  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner, and gave me his location.  Estrella called a couple more times to ""verify my address"".  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor.  As we pulled out of my neighborhood, we PASSED the cab. He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost. This is a TAXI service, they should know how to get around the valley!!  Don't these people use GPS, or MAPS at least?!?!?!?  End of story, I was still late for my class that I paid 250.00 bucks for. I was not allowed in, and the money is non refundable.  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money.  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER.",0
Outdoor shopping at its best... probably not the best if its hot outside- but great outdoor dining and misters... :-),1
"The service was excellent and the location was great in Old Scottsdale.  For the price, I was shocked at the small portions of food, although nicely presented.  I'm not a big eater, but after we ate an over-priced dinner, appetizer portions, we had to go elsewhere to eat.",0
This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.,0
"I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake. 

The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast.",0
"The first thing that sticks out in my mind was the service.  Our waitress was all smiles and incredibly adorable!


Edamame was perfectly steamed

Salmon Teriyaki was delicious

sake and kirin washed it all down

Older restrant but very good food,1
"As a pretty devoted Fry's shopper, I have to say this is one of my least favorite locations. Unfortunately, it's the closest one to me, so I end up there often. It's almost always crowded, the layout is less than intuitive, and I've gotten questionable produce on more than one occasion. The employees are friendly enough, but it's just no comparison to other locations.

By the looks of it outside, it seems like it would be pretty large, but once you get inside it's cramped and the selections seem limited. 

I suppose this is mostly things they can't change, but it's enough to make me drive a few miles out of my way to avoid it if I have the time.",0

"The Rosson House Museum is a restored home from the 1895's.  And it's also conveniently right next to the Teeter House Tea Room and across from Pizzeria Bianco.  

For under $5, you can take a guided tour of Rosson House and learn what life was like for its residents so long ago. It's a really cool activity to do, and since it's close to so many great restaurants, you can go for dinner and drinks after your tour. 

Walking through the home, it's easy to imagine the lady of the house sipping tea in a dainty cup with her lacy gloves on. 
Or maybe it's just me. 

Houses like this tend to creep me out. I half-expected to see a ghostly woman in a pinafore around every corner, but let me tell you, I'm glad I didn't. 

Either way, coming to Heritage Square and exploring the historic buildings in it is a great way to spend an afternoon.",1
"I love this place.

You might ask ""why does the free roving large land mammal love a place that makes him sweat so hard that he's puked, twice?""

And here's why: if you can get me to yack during a workout from pushing me hard and coming up with exercises I've not done before (which is hard with 4 years in the Army, 17 years of Rugby, and 30 years of riding a bike) then you're doing something RIGHT!

My special lady friend got me into the idea of this as a good way to dog stomp one another via a proxy named Jeff. Jeff is our trainer, and if you'll pardon my digression, allow me to share with you about Jeff.

We have this song in Rugby called ""The S&M Man."" Its a less than politically correct song about a special person, usually someone who trains us or who is a hell of a rugger him/herself, who is so sick, so wrong, that he makes pain fun and delightful. 

And I use the word ""pain"" in the best way. Pain, after all, is just weakness, and in my case old pizzas, leaving the body.

Jeff is amazing. He gets it done in 30 minutes to the point where I don't really want to do anything the next day. Its in and out, slam, bam, thank you ma'am with Jeff and Vitality. This is going to be a part of my training for the long term.",1
"Spa whore, I am! I work in the industry, live in the industry and have breathed the industry for the last 5 years so I know spas. After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My ""corner"", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.
Boy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. 
After anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.
After being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.
I chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.
I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!
I plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.",0
"A very unique restaurant in the old town section of Scottsdale.  Very interesting menu and unbelievably the largest wine list I have ever encountered.  A nice combination.  

Ordered several of the small dishes.  All were cooked to perfection. and tasted very good. 

Especially liked the chopped salad  and scallops were especially good. 

Nice setting.  Friendly greeter and server.  

The atmosphere is very casual with a touch of elegance. 

Recommended for sure.",1
"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....

Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  ""You can't do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners don't allow it.""  ""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.""  ""No.  You'll have to put it away.""

Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  

A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    

I'd kind of like the ""Restaurant Impossible"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over.",0
"Food was ok. Servers ok but cashier was horrible! Ok, some people are just not meant to work in the food industry. At least smile! 

Place had a very gross smell! At first we thought maybe because we were sitting kinda close to the restrooms but the farther we moved from there the worst the smell got! 

Maybe if I'm desperate enough I will go back!",0
"I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!  Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty.",1
"Drinking coffee from Cartel makes me want to get my own San Franciscan SF-25B Coffee Roaster, in much the same way I wanted my own pottery wheel after seeing the movie Ghost.

It's. That. Good.",1
"I came here on Friday with a dire craving for Soba Noodles. I have never had Soba Noodles, before and I have been yearning it since watching a rerun of Iron Chef Japan the other night. Upon glancing over the menu I decided to order Shrimp Tempura Soba, $6.95 a Squid Salad $3 and bought a soda. All of which came to $15 bucks with tip. Not a bad deal at all IMO. 
I began with the Squid Salad. A more than generous portion of Squid I thought for the price. It was cooked and marinated quite nicely. Next up, the main dish. The Tempura came on the side as 2 Shrimp Tempura and a piece of Carrot Tempura. The Tempura batter was actually quite nice, no complaints there. Now for the Soba. It came in a huge piping hot bowl. The broth was very clean, fresh, and enjoyable. The Soba Noodles tasted good I thought. I can't give a comparison to other Soba Noodles though, so I don't know if they were great of terrible as far as Soba is concerned, but I had no complaints. This is one of those things where I have to try numerous Soba Noodles to make a valid argument. But as far as I'm concerned it didn't disappoint. The one odd thing I thought though was that I did not see one Japanese employee in there. Kind of quirky, but oh well. This is a solid meal at a good value.",1
Unfortunately Out of Business.,1
"The service sucks at Matt's. Unfortunately for those of us that like good food AND good service the food is crave worthy- better than any breakfast I have ever had, so simple and so, so, yummy. That being said, I have never been to a restaurant that ran out of cream for coffee. Not only that but they made it seem like no big deal, no apologies. I had one too many bad experiences and have not been back since. I have been tempted many a time to go back and see if they have changed their evil ways, but I just can't bring myself to do it. We'll see- life is too short to hold grudges, especially when good food is involved, right?

UPDATE: Ok, we ventured back to Matt's to celebrate my birthday in April and I have to say that the service wasn't bad at all.... no more snotty waitresses, so I am adding 2 more stars. If they would make the effort to be really friendly they would get my 5th star... but I won't hold my breath, I think it is just not that kind of place. Now if you really are a thrill seeker I have a challenge for you... go to the bathroom at Matt's (go ahead and ask them where the bathroom is and you will see what I mean)... and if you want to have a good laugh imagine a nine months pregnant woman trying to go to the bathroom at Matt's... yeah, that was fun, luckily I escaped with little more than a pinch on the thigh from the toilet seat... but unless you have a death wish you should definitely empty your bladder BEFORE you go to Matt's...fair warning.",1
These guys are great!  They have helped me with bulbs needs for both my home and office.  Easy to work with and good prices.  Thanks!,1
Stop here every time I'm in town!,1
"In Phoenix on Spring break vacation, we found Baby Kay's by using the entertainment coupon book we bought to use while out there. They were in the front for fine dining, and had a great coupon deal, along with a sample menu. Everything on the sample menu sounded delish, and we very much like the spice of Cajun cooking. It was a little hard to find, although we were not at all familiar with the area. We had the wings as an app. and used the Louisiana gold hot sauce, something new to us that we are having trouble finding in Ohio since we fell in love with it there. The gumbo was outstanding, and even the alfredo pasta had a spice sprinkled on top for a Cajun style kick... it was unexpected, and awesome! Huge portions - that we both had plenty to take with us for a whole other left over meal. ... the prices were great, especially with the coupon (or actually the entertainment card that they punch for fine dining restaurants). Excellent staff- close to closing for the night, and welcomed us in, and didn't rush us at all - made sure we were happy with everything we ordered, very friendly! Definitely would recommend it for any one who likes a little Cajun kick, and something different from chain restaurants...",1
"This place was a disappointment.  

I'm a big fan of a good Italian Beef sandwich.  I was introduced to it when I lived in the Chicago area in 2001.  Since I've moved back to AZ, I am always in search of a good one.  Lately, on my way to Anaheim for a little family fun, I stop at Portillo's in Buena Park or Moreno Valley.  This is a must.  Needless to say this is what I compare Italian Beef sandwiches to.

The Italian Beef sandwich at Al's just did not compare.  Not only was the beef dry even though I got it wet, but it just tasted different.  It was definitely an unexpected taste for me.  The rest of the family agreed too.  The hype was there but did not deliver or meet my expectations for me.

To top it off, the service wasn't the best either.  It took a few times for the cashier to get the order right.  And even though the order was right they still managed to screw up one of the items we ordered.  Though they did rectify it.  And to top it off, we ordered a ""chopped"" salad.  The lettuce wasn't even chopped.  What?  Not chopped?  It's the little things.

We ended up leaving disappointed.  It was a bust for us and definitely not worth the trek from Chandler.",0
"Sorry, I really just don't get it. I didn't hate it and I'm not hating on it now, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.

* Pizzas slapped together resulting in uneven, soggy crusts. Our party ordered 5 of the 6 available.

* Psychological warfare of having to wait forever for just a few tables maintains an air of pompous superiority that tricks the famished patrons into reporting the pizza is a lot better than it really is. Waiter actually boasted about the 3 to 4 hour Saturday night wait, which we got around by having reservations!

* Bottles of iced tea and other drinks bought in bulk rather than any alternative that would make more sense.

Good? Not bad... Best in the Phoenix Valley? HIGHLY debatable, but personally I really can't say that I think so... Best is the USA? Impossible, there's just no way.

LGO is better. Cibo is better. Spinato's is better.

Most hyped? Most definitely.",0
I love love this store!! Their reduced fat chicken salad and pasedena salads are to die for. The prepackaged frozen meals are also yummy! My daughter loves their yogurt and premade pasta meals. Their clif bars are 1/2 the price as supermarkets!! The employees are extremely nice and helpful. I would SO recommend this store to any and every one!!,1
"Spoke with the office manger she confronted me on the Yelp review. I told her the truth I shouldnt of been schdled to see the general dentist there when the Oral surgeon wouldnt be in until Oct! and they knew that befre I came in on 8-10, I should of been called befre 8-10 so I can switch offices before coming in and wasting everyones time. I hope they keep their end of the bargin since I was told 3x I will not be charged for x-rays that I dont get a bill and actually get chrged. Im happy she told me that she will take it to her higher ups to work out their issues with scheduling as it will probably help them. But my experience so far was a waste of mine time and I feel the only way they will change is if they get reviews that really work on it. The office wasnt busy when I went..whats keeping people out??",0
"Reddddddd Robin.....Yum.

Whiskey River BBQ burger is really all I get here so i cant speak to any other thing.  Its just hard to stray away from that good of a burger.

When I was here most recently, I ordered the sweet potato fries instead of the normal fries....they were great...however they dont have a sauce for them and there is also no brown suger or anything on them to take them to the next level...so you end up with good fries that get bland after about 5. :(  comeon Red Robin, develop a sauce to go with those fries.

As always, the staff was very friendly and attentetive.  I always seem to get good service here.",1
"Everything here is awesome! I love the Kung Pao shrimp and the Hong Kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house. The soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well. Everything tastes made to order, always fresh never greasy, and is presented beautifully. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Definitely try this place! It's a regular lunch spot for my office. They also have great lunch specials. :)",1
"This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I've been many times and it's always fabulous. I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos - they are so good! I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco, Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast, and the Cowboy Beef Stew. The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious. This place is also good for Sunday brunch. Good bartender too - drinks are never too weak.",1
"Came here last Saturday to see what it was all about but I really wish I had come on Friday instead.. The crowd was a little strange and consisted of mostly older people.. They played a mix of top 40s and hip hop whereas on Friday nights it's mainly hip hop.. The drinks run about $7-10 a piece and the bartender that helped me was very friendly! She even offered my friend and I a free shot.. The music wasn't very consistent so there weren't too many people on the dancefloor unless it was a hip hop song playing, so I spent most of my time sitting in their outdoor patio.. I love the decor and the ambiance but I really wasn't feelin the scene on Saturday.. I'm gonna have to return sometime on a Friday night to see how that goes..",0
"Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail.",0
"Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu. This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had! I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of ""chain sushi"" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu. There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan! 
Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You won't be disappointed. 
The area and building are misleading... However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you. This is real sushi...
Go try and enjoy!",1
"Had a fantastic experience! Hernan, our server was excellent. Knowledgable and charming. The food was fantastic. The chefs selection meat and cheese tray was insane. Crazy flavor. Well done!",1
"Outstanding service and food , drinks are not bad. Service can't be beat.",1
Home made fresh noodles.  Reminds me of San Francisco china town food.,1
"Only had a chance to experience the Oscuro (amber lager) and the pizza (the Arizona vs. Boston) so far but it's enough to make me want to come back and try more.

Lots of flat screens. Should be a great place to spend a Sunday afternoon watching footbal in the fall.",0
"This would be a 
great place to live at",1

Los Dos makes it spicy so come prepared to drink a lot of margaritas...not like that's a bad thing.

"I am very happy to say that Angela's truffles are taking off here in Cottonwood. I hope I am allowed to say I am a proud purveyor. When they arrived I was impressed by their design and further blown away by the flavor. (Tears in my eyes...) My darling, have no fear, there are people up here who understand flavor, quality and most importantly: Great Chocolate! My beautiful patrons have latched onto these delectable wonders and I am happy to say The Cocoa Palette will always have a place in Northern AZ Wine Country with Bonne Lait! Bravo mon ami!",1
"What an exciting time.  I am writing my first YELP review about the wonderful MOJO Yogurt  I visited yesterday afternoon.   There were so many wonderful flavors to choose from and the people there were nice enough to pass out tiny little sample cups.  It was a challenge narrowing down my selections to a few flavors but I somehow managed.  I ended up with Birthday Cake (that's right, there is Birthday Cake flavored yogurt, life IS good), Cafe Latte, and the divine Original Tart.  After throwing on a few gummy bears I was a happy girl.  I see in other reviews that some complained about pricing but I am willing to pay a little extra for quality and happiness.",1
"This Mimi's is near the Reach11 complex where we were attending a tournament.  So, afterwards, we came here.

The short version is that this is just like the Mimi's in Chandler.  

The food is fine.  Not great, but fine.  The service was OK too.  Everyone enjoyed their food (I had the chicken pot pie).  None of it really struck me as ""French"", which is Mimi's motif, but it was good.  In fact, the kid had chicken picatta, which is Italian.  Not French.  They do have quiche, so maybe that's enough to claim to be a French-like bistro???  (Not in my book, honestly.)

Anyway, I'd call this place average.  Really, I should give it 2.5 stars, but that's not an option with Yelp.  An OK place to stop if you're in the area and looking for food.  You could do much worse.",0
"I really like eating here.  I have only been for lunch, and I have found that the service is competent and friendly, and the food comes out FAST.  I've probably eaten at MBFGR five or seven times, and the only time I had a problem was on my last visit, where they served me a plate with cold fries.  This was a mistake, as I had a slight hangover and really, really wanted my gyros pita and fries that day, so I asked for fresh fries.  Well, whether it was to apologize or to be sassy I can't say, but either way, I ended up receiving the biggest fattest plate of fresh, hot fries I've ever seen.  They definitely made up for their faux-pas.

I'm a huge fan and will be back many, many times.  Opa!",1
"Hmmm ... where to start.  Food was good, flavorful, no complaints; although for the price I did not think the portions were that great - but everything was tasty and everyone enjoyed their meals.

It's a big open place, with concrete floors and picnic table type environment.  Patio with misters and big open doors to the outside.  A good atmosphere for BBQ.  Someone mentioned the parking being marginal (very true - same as when this was a bar in it's prior life).  I think my biggest downside is how much I had to serve myself - go to the counter to order, pay, get to table, get drinks, get place settings (plastic utensils), for a beer have to go to the separate bar area, order, pay, return for more, etc. (can't order beer where you order food).

While I enjoyed the food, not sure how often I'll be back - would not want to be there when it was crowded and have to wait in lines repeatedly.",0
"If there was a Cantina Laredo in my home (Los Angeles) I would dine here regularly despite the multitude and variety of Mexican dining options.      Needless to say, when I'm in Scottsdale, I often find myself drawn to Cantina Laredo.  

From the moment you're in, to the moment you're out, Cantina Laredo takes excellent care of your tastebuds.  The chips are salsa aren't filler but a real treat.  Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home -- some of my favorite salsa anywhere.  I believe they have three different kinds.  Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100% pure agave goodness.  (I promise to never use that phrase again, sorry Readers.)

The entrees aren't just your common taco/burrito fare.  Using juicy meats, creative homemade sauces, and interesting pairings, Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture -- reminding diners how lovable these things are.

The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well.  An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal.

"I love this quiet location right of I-10.  Their selection is exactly as reported online, and the online orders I placed are always ready for pickup when they are supposed to be.  Parking is wide open, service is good, and the area isn't overpopulated yet so it's always relatively quiet here.",1
"I adore RA!  They have a great selection of sushi.  Go for Happy Hour.  Its only a couple of hours, but you really get some great items for pretty cheap.  You can even get a large Asahi for about $5!",1
"I'll never forget my first Urban Cookie. I was checking out after a successful day of shopping at Frances (my favorite boutique), when the girl behind the counter offered me some cookies they had out on a tray. I hesitated at first (because I was worried about fitting the new skinny jeans I had just bought) but gave in after little persuasion.

It was love at first bite. After buying my jeans, I rushed immediately to Urban Cookie and bought one of every kind. Although it was close, Urban Trail was my favorite. 

I really can't help myself, I keep going back for more (plus the owner is super cute). 

I love urban cookie!",1
"This has to be the worst restaurant in terms of hygiene. Two of my friends had food -poisoning after having dinner here. The food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries, and I am not sure if any health/hygiene code is followed here. 
The service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect, the owner does not allow dine-in after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11. 

One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands (great example to the servers!). I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar, and it definitely looked dirty.

I have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant, including Haji Baba, the Vietnamese place and others, but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food. If you need a spicy-food fix, i strongly recommend you do not try this place, lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day.",0
"Meh.

Plus for cool decor. Minus for being in a strip mall (but hey it's Phoenix...)

Cinnamon Roll was good.  Awesome icing. Toluca Brizza was unique, but nothing spectacular.

it would be a good place for groups, with a vast menu (that i hear is very vegan friendly), but they are better places around town for brunch, both in terms of quality and price points.",0
"My husband surprised me with a stay-cation at the Westin Resort for the weekend and we ate here on our first night!

Let me just say, I LOVE MUDDLED DRINKS, I am not a fan of cosmos or martini's or anything that just tastes like strong alcohol - BLAH! For me stronger isn't better, flavor and uniqueness is better! This place has by far the best muddled drinks I have ever had! If you just want to go for drinks they have this cute little drink bar right before you enter the restaurant - separate from the main dining which I thought was nice. The decor is romantic latin! I love it! 

We started our dinner first by receiving these potato rolls. OMG where have these been my entire life!!!!???!! They are just fall apart in your mouth good! We both ordered mambo mango drinks - STELLAR! We then got the tres ceviches (lobster escabeche / mixto clasico / ruby red tuna) the lobster was the best! But all very good. However the crab empanada was my favorite! YUM!

My husband got the jidori chicken and myself the adobo pork. Both were good but not GREAT. Too much seasoning on my pork. To me this place is a MUST go to for drinks and small bites. I would have given this place five stars but the entrees just didn't do it for us. However, it was not horrible - just okay. The rest of our experience with dinner - service, restaurant ambiance, overall feel and all of our food and drinks before the entrees was AMAZING! So we will be back just for a more small bites and drink night!",1
"As a vegetarian with a fairly adventurous palate, I love Ethiopian food. And now that I work in northern Tempe, I'm here all the time. It's filling, flavorful and inexpensive. I can have a pretty big dinner for less than $10. If you, like me, think spiced (though not particularly spicy) vegetables are the greatest things on Earth, definitely pay a visit to Blue Nile.",1
"I love happy hour!  3PM to 6PM EVERYDAY! This place has one of, if not, THE BEST!!! $4 Grilled Chicken Quesadillas, YES!!  Plus $4 or $5 for a mile high pile of Green Chile  Chicken Nachos?  YES!!!  And if you really want a treat...$9 for 3 huge fillet Mignon Tacos.  Plus COLD BEER both bottle and tap plus reasonable mixed drink prices.  Place is friendly, bar plays classic rock, most patrons seem to be regulars...once you eat there, you will be too!  Friendly staff especially Hostess Judith and the young man with the red hair.  I've been in the restaurant  related business for 30 years, the prime phrase is CONSISTANCY and the food, atmosphere and friendly people are always consistant.  Consistantly great.  The owner, Andrew, always makes a point to great everybody.  New Orleans Bartender exudes Southern Hospitality.  Regular Menu is a bit pricey, portions could be larger, but food is great.",1
"Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich! Great service, and the atmosphere was really cool. Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine. (50 cents, apparently)",1
"Holy crap Thomas is spot on, hilarious.  The first thing I thought when I first walked in this place was ""I'm feeling mighty little"".  

Big heavy pieces for sure, dark woods, carved, unique.  You need a big space to show off this stuff.  Lots of Mexicali knicker knackers.  I still have a few pieces with me here in Hotlanta, but it doesn't quite fit anymore....

Anyone want to buy it?  Shipping is only $5,000....",1

"Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!  

We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous!

Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time!

Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect!

Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey!

We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise!

We can't wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley.",1
"F724 

She didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). 

So, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: 

1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html 

2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. 

3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. 

4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. 

5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. 

Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. 

Oh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).

"After our fav Mongolian place closed I was set on having Mongolian the night we came across AJ's.

It was decent. 

It seemed a bit over priced. 

The soft serve was kinda gross and the chocolate was out of order. 

The all you can eat soup looked like it had been sitting there for a good 8 hours. 

Will I go back? Maybe. 

Was I impressed? Not really.

Did I leave full? Yes.",0
"What  a beautiful facility. Attention to detail is what this place is about and the army of workers each takes his / her portion of the details and does a mighty fine job. If you want a high end place to stay. This is a good choice. When I made my hotwire reservation and ended up here, I got the deal of the century! I am sure the rack rate is high, but if you want comfort and great facility. this would be a wonderful choice! 
Oh yes, Everyone and I mean everyone was soooo nice. The gardeners,  the cleaning staff, the front desk, the parking attendant, all of them were super nice and fun and genuinely happy to be of service..",1
"Definitely going to make this a normal visit instead of waiting 3 years to try it.  Kool Aid in a Mason Jar was all I needed to see to know this was not going to be a typical dining experience and something to remember.  Food was amazing, the staff was friendly and the prices for the portions were more than fair.  Only the off beat location prevents me from making this a 5 star review.",1
"I'm a girl who knows her way around a donut. The boyfriend and I would usually venture out to Chandler to get our Bosa Donut fix so I was super excited to discover they had opened a location closer to home. I was also super scared for my waistband.

Bosa is hands down the best donut shop in the Valley. Not that there is a ton of competition but still. They're really good. They offer a wide variety from your classic cake to puffy glazed, filled to fritters. My favorite is the glazed twist. So chock full of sugary sweetness my teeth kinda hurt just thinking about it. Their donuts are always fresh and they keep a good stock available so you're not stuck with only the coconut donuts.

I brought in a bunch to work the other day and my co-workers gobbled them up. Who doesn't love being handed a frosted piece of donut heaven?

I'm sure I will become a regular of the Tempe Bosa in no time.",1
"Breadfruit is a cool spot. The interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about 15-20 people, making a nice, intimate ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..

We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $5 corking fee, not to shabby.

We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish. 

For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...

The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!",0
"I was just thinking how long it's been since I've been to trivia on Tuesday nights and it made me sad.  I definitely need to get back into my trivia groove!

Other than missing trivia, I'm seriously craving some Jamaican Jerk Wings.  YUM!!  Not to mention the delicious guac that they'll make at your table if it's not too busy.  

Great bar, one of my faves.  Great servers/bartenders and fun, come-as-you-are atmosphere.  Not a typical Tempe bar which is quite refreshing.",1
"Could use a remodeling job, but the food is really good for the area.  The wait staff is very attentive, and the free chips and hot sauce for dipping, are REALLY GOOD.  The fajitas are my usual.  Worth the visit and you'll leave satisfied.",1
Chambord margaritas are killer!,1
"I have been to this place a couple of times and so far each time has been a great experience for the most part.  The food is awesome, and the atmosphere is fun and friendly (definitely family oriented, with a lot of outdoor seating).

Out of the two times that I have been here, I have tried their fontina burger, the pesto chicken sandwich, the sweet potato fries, and the garlic fries. The burger was delicious, the chicken in the pesto chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection, and the fries were awesome (although, the garlic fries had too much garlic for my taste). 

The only downside is that this place is always packed  (or at least the two times that I have been here).  It was featured on the Food Network, so I kind of knew that it was a popular place. But the funny thing is that I thought if going at a later time for lunch and on a weekday that it wouldn't be bad, but I was wrong and the line was still out the door.  Also, I kind of wanted to try their milkshakes, but the line was way too long to get back into (sort of wish they had an express line for desserts). 

Oh, and check out their restroom for a weird/funny surprise.",1
"Decent menu which includes the traditional satay, tom yum koong, curries, pad thai etc. What threw me off was teriyaki, sweet and sour chicken, kung pao, chow mein. Food is good with great portions! Careful on the heat scale. 10 is blazin...
Weird thing....I was really thirsty after the meal. Usually that's the result of using the other type of SaLt. 
Overall the place is clean, modern, and staff are attentive. Curries are 10 bones, Fried rice at 9, and most entrees at 9 bones! Price is a buck plus more than our So Cal places. Give it a try, food is good, and service is fast.  
Damm..I need to drink another bottle of soda!!!

"I couldn't wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars, too! 
After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadn't been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!! 
We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous! 
Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries. 
Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage! 
The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY! 
I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top!
Next time, I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)... 
I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean...
REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!",1
"Love massages and facials!

I would highly recommend Enrique for a massage.  Great technique.  Great membership prices and great walk-in schedule for those last minute needs.",1
"We went here for the fabulous UYE. As the restaurant is often empty, Julia though it would be good to give them some business...but in the end it was our group that ended up being given the business. The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we weren't really on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didn't seem that out of line, a bit on the pricey side but nothing alarming. Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with 4 tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got 4 of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $11 a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan.

Regardless of the price and the mediocre food, it was well worth going for the amazing company of the awesome Phoenix Yelpers. I don't think I would go back for the food though.",0
"No offense to locals, because Glendale ""Glitters"" with ""Chocolate"" downtown, but this mall hastily developed around the silver Jiffy Popcorn pan  that is University of Phoenix Stadium (misnomer, it is for the professional football team, the Arizona Cardinals, named after the omnipresent UofP distance learning and professional college, ala National University) and the Jobing.com (local based employment dot com) Arena (home to the NHL Coyotes) is really just a North Snobsdale (aka Scottsdale, Snotsdale, She'sGotTail) Kierland Commons Wannabee Mall!

It is 4 stories high, shaped like a football and stadium, with huge billboards facing into the 2 water fountains, its only redeeming value.

It is populated with typical Scottsdale type restaurants....Big on decor, small on taste, with chain restaurants peddling Chef/Designer highly stacked fusion flavors masking average casual food for a larger tab per serving. 

Even the hords of young, large bossomed hostesses, bartenders and waitresses in black t-shirts are the attractions that were first ubiquitous in Scottsdale, then downtown Phoenix around the Diamondback Stadium, has now moved to the west side of the Valley! Margarittaville, Johnny Rockets, Fox Sports Grill, Kabuki Japanese...all formula chains for the average masses who think they are getting something special, but aren't. 

Meanwhile, the Superbowl early this year, the reason why this complex was completed (and for the new football Stadium) has come and gone, the housing boom has collapsed, and the westside house prices have dropped 30 - 40%. Consequently, within a couple of blocks, the luxury condos are being auctioned off, the Westgate Offices atop the stores are empty, and so are the new office buildings. 
The anchor Hotel the Renassaince, also a Westin of Kierland  poser, is nicely lit but largely empty. There is a conference center attached, so it might get some occupancy other than Football season weekends, but the Homewood Suites nearby has got to be a summer bargain hotel.

This is classic Valley gaudiness at its worst. And it is set conveniently off the Loop 101 at Glendale Road near the Agua Fria riverbed, but otherwise it is a vast open field of former farm land. Still, it is the only decent mall within miles, so it is a beacon for the young and bored westsiders looking for something besides their quiet bedroom communities of strip malls and convenience stores.",0
"This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley. They serve both Korean and Japanese food. They are quick and attentive. Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine I've had in Phoenix. I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I can't really tell the difference between Takamatsu's version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. It's a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for ""dessert.""",1
"Just OK.  But like pizza and sex, there really is no bad BBQ.  
I think there is something lost in translation from its Texas roots to AZ.  Gone is the appeal of the gas station dive.  Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building.  The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces.  The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.  If a true amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys.  Now I need to stop at the new BBQ joint next door to see which one will get my BBQ dollars... stay tuned.",0
"The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.

The good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.

I didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good.",1
"Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St. & Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad.",1
"I love sprinkles cupcakes. I have also managed to go to every location except the 3 in so cal. Like every location, the taste and quality is consistent and delicious. I got the salt caramel, banana, and carrot this time around. Like always, it's delicious and lasts for as long as they say it does. My pup loves the pupcakes too. I would wait for these cupcakes any time.",1
"There's no business like show business. As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie. I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons. 
   My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets) 
   I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!
   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.  
   Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?  
   The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.
    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other ""ARTS"" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo, as a famous circus/rodeo person once said, ""Go, On With The Show"".",1
"I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time. 

We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say ""Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?"" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. 

The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere. 

Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once. 

Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!",1
"So everyone in Old Town has been waiting for a good sports bar forever. When everyone heard Thunder Dan was coming to town the excitement starting buzzing. Well this time Thunder Dan didn't hit this buzzer beater.

First off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs. 

Thats pretty much where it stops. The food isn't great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didn't impress me. Plus the service was super slow...

This kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps.",0
Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!,1
"What a great place. We (family of three) went on a Sunday afternoon. What a fun place, great food, friendly staff. The manager was there, she let my son sit on the michanical bull. fun. fun. fun",1
"When you go to a place called ""Fajitas"" you order the dang namesake! I've had all the different fajitas they offer and I love all them, my favorite is the shrimp it's lightly seasoned and grilled to perfection (side note: order the onions and pepper caramelized)! The tortillas are strong enough to fold without tearing yet still have a nice flavor. The toppings are always bright and fresh, the guacamole is legit. My coworker has talked me into always ordering a side of Queso with the free chips and salsa. Albeit the restaurant is old but the staff is super friendly and detail oriented. And yes, no matter what you order you will smell like fajitas so make sure you don't have anywhere special to go after eating here.",1
"Sanctuary you've been replaced.  Willow Stream Spa is my new fav spa spot.  Loved. Loved. the service.
Robe got slightly damp from use, helpful attendant appears and gives me a new one.  Loved the waterfall treatment.  Loved private rooftop pool.  Loved the attendant walking around giving us sun bathers bottles of cold water.  Loved the fitness classes, the facility.
All this for $50 during AZ Spa Week.  
The facility and service is so f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s here that I would come here anytime and think every penny I spent was worth it!",1
"After reading many decent reviews and seeing how close the restaurant was to home, I decided to give it a try.

The young lady at the counter was impatient and had no interpersonal skills. The food was just not good; this place is 'Chinese take-out' at best.",0
It was pretty good. But I dont know much about Indian food. It was better than the only other place I've been too which had dirty grey chicken in its dishes. Taste was good.,1
"I thought Trader Vic's was very nice.  Food was very good.  Atmosphere was great.  Staff was very very friendly and fun.  They even gave me tons  of recommendations of places to eat in the area since I am new around here.  

I recommend the lamb.",1
"Perfect for a nightcap. Dim, moody lighting and totally intimate. Drinks are pretty pricy and didn't eat any food, but the service was great! I loved the 'feel' of the place so much I'd go back sometime.",0
"Outside the treats, you get an adorable and sleek interior which is very comfortable and feels great to be in, and fun people watching to boot. Its a little expensive for the drinks - I figure that comes with the territory.",0
"yes I agree! Fellow NY-er here says this restaurant has some of the best NY pizza in town! They also catered my brother's rehearsal dinner and all the food was great. ( sausage and peppers- yummy!)

Update-6/25/11 - Walked in last night to catch Steve Benson spinning the CD's and drawing caricatures-hello? Not missing that gig. Me- ""Wow you remodeled the place""  LIz- the wonderful, superstar waitress- ""Yeah, nine years ago"" -hahahaahahah! PWEEWWT!!!! I guess I have been eating mostly take out or catering from them over the last few years. LOL! The place looks beautiful and the food is outstanding. The owner is from Smithtown, NY and I love her and this place. Manga!

PS- Hello did I mention Steve Benson was there?- Again did I mention Steve Benson does first Friday's there? You can get a caricature done by none other than Steve Benson. Oops, I'm sorry did I mention Steve Benson is there once a month on Fridays Dj'-ing and drawing -(D and D-lol)  Being politically motivated/involved and an executive member of AEA I was in heaven! I love my teacher caricature! Check it out. Fun times!",1
"Cliff notes
- Cheap: $1-2/plate
- Fast: It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor
- Acceptable quality: I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lol

This place is definitely good for what it is, ""it"" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to ""reduce costs"" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.

On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time). 

I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).

For those claiming to be ""left to fend for themselves"" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called ""the menu"" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as ""descriptions"" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL DIAF

And the cherry on top? $4 large japanese beers and $5 sake bombs! HELL YEAH!",1
"Since I work @ a casino, I'm always checking out the others...Plus, I like to gamble!! 

This place is nice, but seemed to be lacking personality. It's new, so it's very clean, w/all new machines. The few employees I dealt with, seemed extremely bored, and a drink girl was nowhere to be found. Because this place is new, and @ the edge of the Phx. area, they don't have to try very hard, and I think it shows.",0
"This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart.

This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make. 

The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there. 

I will NOT be returning to this place.......",0
"I LOVE PITA JUNGLE! Why aren't they in Chicago?! Damn this unhealthy meat-lovin city! Let's try something different...

Anything I've had here was remarkable, and I've tried a couple of different Phoenix-based locations, so they're doing something right. Try the jalapeño hummus for a great spin to a Greek dish, and if you're really hungry, I highly recommend any of their lavosh pizzas. My favorite though? The Chipotle Chicken Lavosh Pizza, of course! It is delicious and mouth-watering.

I deduct 1 star solely for the fact that their parking lot is VERY inconvenient and way too crowded.",1
"nice and trendy restaurant with great food!
will definitely come back again!",1
"This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!! We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all! The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the ""staining as he would say"" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?",0
"Talk about options!  It's almost unfair to have so many items on a menu.   Especially when the food is so good.  I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory several times and have not been able to even put a dent in the menu.

So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.  

The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold.  

I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but that's just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered. 

I will go back again!",1
"I've got mixed feelings about at&t... just as I'm sure that most people have mixed feelings about their mobile carrier.  But this review isn't for at&t as a company, it's just for the Scottsdale store where I stopped in recently to return a phone.

Long story, but I had a temporary android phone and hated it.  After hours (literally hours) on the phone with at&t customer service, I worked it out so that I could return my android phone at this store and then head over to the apple store with my upgrade eligible status to get the new iPhone.  That part is another story, and took longer than expected, but luckily, I did have a decent experience at this store thanks to the help I received from Hasen, the retail sales consultant that helped me out. 

I hope there isn't really ever a need to return to this store, but if you must go, ask for Hasen... he was friendly, answered my questions, and provided the service I was seeking in a speedy yet attentive manner.",1
"I went to the physical location the first time with my dog Foxy to scope out the place.  The store inside is iitttyyy bitttyyy and not worth going to in all honesty, but the staff that work there are REALLY friendly, and helpful.  Foxy eats Evanger's, which is really hard to find, and the only place I knew of that carried it was 20min away from me. 
     A month later, I run out of dog food....so I call Goober (after research I find they sell Evanger's for the cheapest price) and they delivered it right to me.  I wasn't home so they left it on my front porch along with a pretty large amount of free dog treats for Foxy !  They left their newsletter, some reference cards, and their product list (which is HUUUUGGGEEE) in a bag hanging from my door.  The reference cards you give out will earn you discounts on your next purchase!  Oh of course- I forgot to mention the delivery was completely FREE of charge!!!  I'll never get my dog food anywhere else.",1
"Coffee-meh. Not great, not horrible.
Scone-dry.
Service-ridiculously slow.
The night we were there (8/11), the owner came and asked a group of people (who were clearly having some sort of meeting) to stop talking because they were ""disturbing the guitar player."" Chased 8 paying customers (at least I assume they were paying customers; they all had drinks) out the door. Weird!! Don't think I'll be going back.",0

"What's up with the premium gas in this state being only 91 grade?  Where's the 93? 

Anyhoo, this is a very busy gas station at the corner of 16th and Highland. When the pumps are full of cars, it's hard to maneuver in and around the parking lot. The store looks a bit short on supplies, but then again I just went inside to pay. 

I may give it another try, we'll see.  But I'll look elsewhere first.",0
"Over the last 5 years or so, I've eaten lunch at Dilly's Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad. 

Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed. 

I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since. 

As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional ""daily soup"" is appreciated. 

The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.

The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own.

Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.

Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.

Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.",0
"we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try. the online menu looked like it had a few options for non-meat eaters (although it is very much a meat heavy menu). 

for an easter sunday lunch, it was very empty, not a good sign. but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test. our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing. 

the decor is ""country"" but not like cracker barrel....more like neo farm dining. 

i had the blackened fish sandwich, which was cooked really well, nice and seared but juicy, topped with onion, pickles, tomatoes and butter lettuce. i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat...nothing to burn your mouth. 
my wife had the tuna sandwich, which was also tasty and seared just right. she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable, but it was her dish, not mine. her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful. 

i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here. well worth the bike ride.",1
"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night for dinner because we had a restaurant.com gift certificate. Yes, it's in the Sheraton, and yes it's near the airport with not much else around, but I have to say- we were both impressed. 

We started with the Gambas al Fuego, which were deliciously spicy (although I thought that $10 for four shrimp was a bit excessive, no matter how tasty they were). We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful. This place uses quality ingredients.

If it wasn't so out of the way, we would definitely come by regularly. My husband was especially enticed by the prime rib melt sandwich, so I think we'll be back during lunch in the near future. 

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was that the atmosphere was pretty dead. Which I suppose is understandable, given that it's inside the Sheraton. The decor was nice though. They should have a free standing restaurant in an area with more traffic- this place would be a hit.",1
"ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude.",0
"I can't believe some of the things I've been seeing people NAG about in their reviews for this new restaurant! I set my standards pretty high for Rice Paper and they did not disappoint! 

I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho, and had been waiting for this place to open up! The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming, as well was our server! He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far. We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari. I'm not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious, and the squid was perfect; not too soft, not too chewy!

For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef, which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce, with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni... again on the suggestion of my server! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! My wife got the beef pho... at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery... but it was VERY well seasoned! Our server told us that the broth stews for at least 12 hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices! VERY IMPRESSED! 

Yes, it is much pricier than your average pho joint, but I'd rather pay a bit extra for a nice, clean and slightly upscale atmosphere! And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat you'll get in your bowl of pho at some other places! 

Well done Rice Paper, we WILL be back!",1
"Finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right.  Nothing against Samuri Sam's, but Yogis is a bit better in my opinion.  Yogis'  menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available.  The place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  The food is also very reasonably priced.  I was very impressed with their different bowl/plate/salad options.  You are able to order some teriyaki veggies, chicken and/or beef pretty much however you want it.  Extra meat, over lettuce, over veggies, brown rice, white rice, etc.  

Anyway, when I visit a place like this my desires are simple.  I want a decent portion of not-overly-sauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies.  That's it.  Yogis delivers this and then some.",1
"Not super impressed. The food was just ok. My friends said the French toast was good, but my Goat cheese, tomato and mushroom omelette had maybe had an oz. of goat cheese. At 9$ it was a rip off. The potatoes were good,but nothing special. The mimosa was excellent, but made from Andre, so after consuming it I had a headache. The service was slow, but they were good about refilling my coffee and water. Just an ok experience.",0
"We decided to try out Rudy's last night, hoping the lines wouldn't be too long since it was still 107F outside.  We lucked out!  There were only about ten people in front of us, so we felt we scored!  

I am a big fan of Texas BBQ, namely beef ribs and brisket.  I usually go for the lean brisket and light to no sauce (in true TX form).  

Last night we ordered the moist brisket ($12.98/lb), coleslaw and a turkey sandwich ($4.99) for DD.

With three fountain drinks, the price was about $21.  DH also went back and got the banana pudding and the chocolate pudding for DD and himself.  I think he spent about $6 on that.

THE FOOD:  The brisket was DELICIOUS.  It was perfectly smoked and not too fatty for my tastes.  It had a good amount of char on the outer edges, which is my favorite.  The meat stood alone on its own.  Very good sign!  I did try both the Sissy Sauce and the BBQ Sauce.  The BBQ sauce was quite good.  

The turkey was smoked, which is not my favorite, but it was pretty good.  DD ate it after making me remove the ""black edges"" off and getting her two slices of bread instead of the bun it came on.  That was fine with me because I put my brisket on the bun with some BBQ sauce and I was a happy camper.

The coleslaw was good.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  It was crunchy and a little reminiscent of the KFC coleslaw, tbh.  

We were disappointed that they did not have any mac n cheese.  Mac n Cheese goes great with brisket!!!

DESSERTS: The chocolate pudding was yummy and had an oreo cookie crust at the bottom.  

The banana pudding was just okay.  A friend of mine gave me a recipe for banana pudding years ago that is really simple and appears to use the same ingredients, but is far superior.  I wonder if I should share it with Rudy's?!  

Overall, we will definitely get Rudy's again.  However, we will probably just order the brisket to go.  We can make the sides for a lot less and I am sure DD would prefer something other than the turkey for dinner.  

Yes, that's right, will be back.",1
"Super friendly. Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers. Great diner food and decor. Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.  Will definitely be back.",1
"I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. 

We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. 

About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)

I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. 

All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.",0
"My husband and I were in the Staples parking lot, looking for somewhere to eat.  I popped up my trusty Yelp app and found this place, about 30 feet from where I was parked.  It's pretty unassuming from outside, but what an amazing dining experience.  Not only is the food amazing (well, of course--you make it exactly how you like it!) but the portions are such that you should be able to get two meals out of it.  In general, this is a healthy alternative to fast food and an eating experience that your whole family will enjoy.  We plan to take our out of town guests here when they come to visit.",1
"What ever you do don't waste your money here.  I am not the person who likes to send food back, in fact I hate to do it.  I had no choice here, this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten.  The food has such a horrible after taste.  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.  The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.  I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies.",0
"What a wonderful restaurant. I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size. No sauces, no bread, no fries. The fish tacos were delicious, succulent, with just the right amount of spiciness. The grilled, boneless rainbow trout was fantastic. The pane seared, sushi-grade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for. And leave room for dessert....yes dessert. Only $2.50 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl. just enough to stave off the sugar craving.
The decor is elegant and sophisticated. Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress. menu changes 4 times a year and features local, fresh, in 'season' food. Very inventive menu starting mainly around $9 (flatbreads and sandwiches) to $16 for lunch. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive.
Great food, great atmosphere, great for your waist line. But even if you're not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality, taste and presentation.",1
"I was there on a Friday night with a few friends in the hopes of a quick drink and nosh after a show next door.
My companion and I ordered basic drinks and were met with shots of liquor in the bottoms of our glasses and a blank look from the waitress when I asked if they were out of mixers.  After this, we opted not to order any food (taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water) and were met with an outrageous bill (for our two 'well' shots).  We questioned the tally and were met with a second total that wasn't much better.  
Our credit card was charged twice: $40 for some wet ice and a lemon wedge.  There are many cool and artsy places in Phx where we can catch live music and nosh with friends.  I'll pass this one up from now on.",0
"Recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children's plates for adults or any age.

It was SUPER CHEAP & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc.

What a deal!

Under 5. bucks including the drink.

I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc. or just about anywhere.",1
"Yogi's is a great place to grab a quick, fairly-cheap meal. I love the Arizona bowl - it's a great alternative for you sushi craving if you don't feel like spending a lot of money.

The quality of the food isn't bad. The sushi rolls are alright. The staff is moderate - they've never done anything to impress me, but haven't done anything to disappoint either.",0
This place is so good. I love the big sandwhiches and the soups are so delicious. The only complaint I have is that I went twice and I unfortunately got hair and a fingernail clipping in my soup in two different times I went.,1
"The food here is consistently good. We tend to come here annually at Christmastime while shopping at the mall. Went last week with the ladies and had the ultimate food envy watching my cohort eat a chicken salad sandwich. Came back this week to test it out and it is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever eaten. May have to add this to my rotation of dining spots. 
My other dining mates had  the Shepards Pie, which was delicious and the grilled fish tacos which were also exceptional. I always have a sense of trepidation when I pore over the such an extensive menu. But 3 out of 3 dishes were a winner. Yet another chain with multiple locations in the valley.",1
"Much more organized than the last time I was there, and I noticed more price systems vs having to ask. The even had the new Color Club halo hues I have been hunting for!!! They had 5 of the 6 colors and they were the highest priced polished in the store at 6.50 a pop!! Still MUCH cheaper that the 11$ everywhere else. No striping tape!!! Although the owner did say he had ordered it before and it didn't sell well...... I just went down the street and got some...:)) yay candy cane nails!!!",1
"Who would have ever thought, chicken and waffles combination?  It is crazy, but it sure does.  The location of hidden inside a big plaza of Albertsons, Aces Hardware, Gas Station, and much more.  It is really hard to find unless you have been inside the shopping center.  People here in AZ like to say something is located on the northwest corner of the street.  This would make it impossible to describe.

Once you get there, the restaurant is pretty small.  Typically there is a pretty long wait, but I was lucky the day I went. One good thing is they offer white breast chicken meat, which is always a bonus.  The chicken was tasty, even though I am normally not a fan of fried chicken.   I love waffles, but it seemed like the waffles came out cold, as though they were reheated or Eggo Waffles.  I loved Eggo Waffles growing up, but I don't expect frozen waffles at an establishment.  I would stick to the chicken and call this place Lo Lo Chicken House.",0
"This place is awesome. 

A cornish pasty is like a big calzone stuffed with whatever you choose. They have many choices and all regular choices are also available as vegetarian entrees. These are HUGE so come hungry! Their tomato soup is also good but I would definitely stick to a pasty if you want a delicious meal.

The place is pretty divey but in a really great way. I have also heard they are expanding so those of you who have complained about their cramped quarters may find some reprieve soon. Personally, I like the small dark divey feel.

They also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you haven't tried it. 

I like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area, which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time.

Highly recommend it if you are in the area.",1
"I've been meaning to Yelp for a looong time now, and after having brunch at Scramble today, I thought it only fitting that I give them my Yelp virginity.

My boyfriend and I arrived around 1pm and it was pretty quiet. There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly. 

I requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didn't seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were 2 tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldn't decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside.

In a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles I've had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger. 

The order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good.

The highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! It's served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. I've never had anything like it. I highly recommend it.

My boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash.

Scramble is a great place, especially considering their vegan breakfast options, which are far too few-and-far-between in the valley. We will absolutely be back!",1
"Not the newest or the nicest but, everything you need and usually no wait for machines. The staff is super nice and there are magazines to read while your there. If they could just turn up the AC a little bit and put ESPN on more than two of the TVs.",0
"I had never been to Dominick's and I like trying new restaurants so I was excited to check it out.  We had a reservation for 8 pm on Saturday night and when we showed up the restaurant was busy.  It definitely is catering to those that want to be seen and show off what they have.  As we were walking up they had 6-7 of your finest vehicles backed in right next to the front door.

Calling it a front door is a little misleading however.  I found it interesting for such a nice restaurant to have a revolving door as there entrance.  Once inside the door you are greeted by what is a darkened ""Liberace"" type decor.  Think big chandeliers and crushed velvet.  We were seated promptly for our 8 pm reservation.

Top line the food was mediocre.  We between the 4 of us we ordered the  Scallops, Halibut, and the Ribeye as our entrees.  For our sides we ordered the potatoes, gnocchi, and creamed corn as our sides.  The main issue that we all had with the food was that it was very salty.  At one point my buddy across the table asked me "" does yours taste really salty?"". I answered yes and everybody else chimed in that theirs was quite salty as well.  I don't know if the chef was having a bad night but if not he needs to pump the brakes on his salt usage!

Finally this place isn't the cheapest place.  I am not one to complain about prices and I eat at fine dining restaurants on a weekly basis as part of my job.  Our bill for the 4 of us was $500.  We did have a couple drinks a piece but the price we paid did not match the quality of food we received.

My advice is to check out the bar for a few drinks and enjoy the people watching.  Think Phoenix Open.  Otherwise if you are looking for a good steakhouse head across the street to Ocean Club.",0
"Service was fast and friendly, the mixed drinks are great!  We went on a busy Friday night and a lot of family's where there.  They have a man walking around making balloon figures.  The slide/ stairs is a great touch for kids.  The food was OK, nothing outstanding.

The view was amazing, it overlooks the entire city.",0
"Toasted subs at their best..   The worst part of eating here is trying to choose one sandwich out of my four or five favorite picks.  And in the fall when they bring out the soups, I can hardly resist ordering the cream corn soup with my meal.",1
Fast and a drive thru. What more is there?,0
"I have tried the other one on shea, but this is close to home and work. I love the enviornment, the clientle, the healthy food, outstanding service and very reasonable prices. The waitstaff is great, the food always comes out quick and tastes amazing. Get anything with chicken as it is delicious and if you like hummus try it here. Also, they have great ice tea. This place is one of my favorites and well worth a try.",1
Best cheese steaks since the last time i was in Philly. Highly recommended,1
"Great sandwiches at reasonable prices. The bread is good, the au jus was flavorful and not too salty, and the sausages are made daily.  It was nice to find a place to get great sandwiches. The line moves a little slow, but it's definitely worth the wait. I had the italian beef and my friend had the sausage, both were great.",1
Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. I'm willing to try again later.,0
"One of our favorite pizzas in the Phoenix-area. Well... definitely my husbands. He LOVES, LOVES, LOVES Grimaldi's. 

We always get the same pizza. Every.Single.Time. 

Large pizza -- pepperoni, sausage, and red onion. (That way we can have leftovers the next day - - and I'm not a leftover person.)

SO good!

This location has more outdoor seating than the one in Chandler. Plus they have another side room/building that is great for private parties.",1
I have eaten here twice now and this place is phenomenal!  Great price and amazing food.  I highly recommend the baked ziti!  I will go back at least twice a month.,1
"Jamba is definitely as good as it gets when it comes to chain smoothie places. We are big fans of the Acai antioxidant smoothie, which is unlike the other smoothies that we've tried there. It is super healthy and has a distinct flavor to it which we like because it's not as sweet as their traditional smoothies are. I like going to Jamba because they are always reliable, fast and friendly when we have visited, even if the smoothies are a tad pricey. But, you get what you pay for, and I would much rather pay a little extra for a consistently good smoothie that I know will be delicious than take my chances on an unknown place that most likely won't deliver the goods.",1
"I really wanted to enjoy my experience at Indulge, but didn't. From the website, local magazine reviews, and driving by, I expected it to be a slightly upscale neighborhood joint, but it really is no different than a Fuddruckers.
We were underwhelmed by the food and hated the environment. Two of us built our own burgers, and one ordered a pre-made pick off the menu. We had the dill chips (fried pickles) as an appetizer. I can't say that any of us loved our meal, and as soon as we walked out we all agreed we weren't interested in going back. It was just no better than you could make at home (and I burn soup).  
The tables were crowded, too close together, and the place was uncomfortably noisy. Our servers were trying to clear plates as soon as one of us set down a fork (no one was waiting for our table), and asked for our dessert orders while we were still eating. 
The whole experience was rushed, loud, uncomfortable, and not ""indulging"" in any way. I'm so disappointed.",0
"The employees at this location are sooo nice! Even when it's super busy they are still very friendly. My favorite thing about this place is it's open 24 hours! If you want breakfast for dinner or a milkshake at midnight you can have it! My fiancee enjoys their french dip sandwich whereas I always try something different. I just had dental work and have been eating like a senior citizen, so I opted for the mac n cheese. It was warm and gooey with a crunchy cheese topping- a great comfort food. Late at night this place is especially fun because of the people watching.",1
"So my friends and I had to roll each other out of the door after this meal was over but it was sooooooooo worth it!!! BEST red kool-aid ever served in jars!! BEST waffles I've EVER had!! BEST red velvet cake I've EVER had!! I also did enjoy their chicken, mac & cheese and collard greens, but none were the best I've ever had, but very good.  I seriously dream about their waffles and red velvet cake, I don't know what magic mix of ingredients make up the waffle batter but it's absolutely perfect and these waffles would stand deliciously on their own even without butter and syrup, but who'd want to do that? the red velvet slice they give you is HUGE and soooo moist, the frostings is cream cheesy delicousness. I can not wait to indulge in this treat again, but since I'm far from being the only one who loves this place, it is always packed and the wait is long, at least on the weekend. Seriously considering taking a day off of work just for a weekday Lo Lo's run =P",1
Need your Bianco fix but don't want to wait in line for three hours or get in a fight because of a shortcutter? Eat here instead. Take out only and very limited menu but who cares there food is great! Lucky for me I live close by so I can bring it home. There sandwiches are made with all fresh ingredients and their bread is wonderful. Next door is a place called Lux Coffee House. Erick is a hoot. They are very good to their customers and I had the best Vanilla Latte every here. You can sit here with your Bianco sandwich and surf the net with your laptop. A small piece of paradise!!!!!!Be forewarned Bianco's is not cheap!,1
"I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible. I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl. It seemed that the cross between the mai-tai and cosmo would be perfect. My hair is flatter than what I walked in with. My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume, but for some reason its flat! Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated, but have never experienced with a blowdry before. I don't think I'll be coming back, sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely.

Update: They offered me a make up blow out. I decided to try the place out again, thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful. Mistake! Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre, I ended up paying for the service. I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry, but no response.",0
"Perfect patio for a Saturday!

This place walks a fine line between being too snooty and being just plain awesome.  I've had a couple of experiences here, and overall the food is really tasty.  I'm a fan of the gnocchi, even though it's a little different than traditional gnocchi.
The location is great, as long as there isn't a douche bag convention going on, and as long as the bartenders and servers keep their positive attitudes, I think this place will be around for a while. Thanks!",1
"Ticoz is not a bad place.  The menu is eclectic-american and the service has always been friendly, consistent, and attentive.  All the food I've had there has been decent and the prices aren't bad either.  This is a gay friendly restaurant so it's a good place to consider for a same-sex date.  It's also a good place for large groups.",1
"We checked out the prices at The Dump, the sales person there just were too pushy. and their prices were not the lowest.  We checked out the prices at Mattress Firm to see if they were any cheaper.  We had a wonderful experience!  The salesperson was friend and helpful NOT pushy at all.  They had the i-select model bed that my friend was looking for.  They were $200 cheaper, delivery was cheaper, and free tempur pedic pillows.  SOLD!!!  My friend is happy as a customer.",1
"I'll give this one a four for atmosphere and BEER... and Steve the manager. He rocks. The food- eh. I don't go for the food.
So last 4th of July, we were having a keger. Hubski went to pick up the keg from Four Peaks (ice cold Kiltlifter) and there were some waitresses talking about the 4th and how they have no idea what it's about. Well hubski shows up and tells them all what's what. Now we've got a friend in Steve forever.
Everytime we are there, he takes a break to chill with us. We got a tour of the facility. This is cool- the Kiltlifter is supposed to be a Scottish beer. Four Peaks actually has biologists balance the water to match the chemicals to Scottish water. The same with the Hefe- the water matches German water. This is all so that we can have the most delicious and authentic beer possible.
Four Peaks is a laid back place, great beer, good people-watching. Bar food.",1
This is my first time back in years. It will be my last. I was in the bar area for lunch it was almost 1hour 25 min before I could get out. Ten min before my drink order and almost as long before food order. A secound drink forget it. Guy next to me walked out.,0
"AZ 88 is a great date location.  The atmosphere is excellent - always an artistic display, usually great music.  If my parents ever make it out here from Wisconsin, I'm definitely taking them to AZ 88.  The view of the Scottsdale mall is really cool, and the proximity to a number of the ""old"" Old Town bars is really convenient.  The food is reasonably priced, with most sandwiches and dishes right around $10.  They have a good sized bar selection, with some really interesting imported beers.  I would absolutely recommend the AZ 88 sandwich if you enjoy buffalo sauce, and it's really hard for me to not order the little crackers with onions and bacon on them (even despite disliking bacon!).",1
"My mom and my son and I went to old town on a Thursday to check out some galleries and listen to some of the buskers! So after our perusing we stopped to get ice cream. 

Real ice cream! Petersen's is a really cool place and it's brand new! Just opened 11/23 I think. Well they have lots of great flavors like Georgia Peach, NY Black Cherry, Cappuccino, Peppermint with real peppermint, lots of sorbet, lots of chocolate stuff that I didn't want to try, and old favs like cookie dough, butter pecan etc. 

They also sell pints and also gallons I think! 

The staff is super cool and well educated about the history of the shop. I think the girl said they originated in Chicago and that the tiles in the ceiling are from the original location! I just thought that was so cool! She also said that they could sub the milk in your lattes and coffe with ice cream to make pepperment lattes and more wild flavors! I thought that was pretty rad. 

Anyway, if you are in old town I highly recomend you check this place out!",1
"We had my husband's birthday party here.  The staff could not have been more accommodating.  They made everything easy! Our friends loved the place and the band (ReGroove) and had a wonderful time.  Drinks are well-priced and very generous.  The owners and staff truly want customers to be happy, comfortable, stress-free and to have a good time!!",1
"3.5 stars. Needed a place to avoid the rain before going to see Tron with my mom at the movie theater next door. We didn't order food, just drinks. There's an OSF in Seattle, and having gone a couple times, while not super familiar with the menu, I know what they serve. Our waitress was actually really awesome- she got us our drinks quickly and was super friendly with our touristy butts. Yeah... it's a chain. I know the food isn't the best and the service can be hit or miss. But the stars are all for our waitress, whose name I (of course) can't remember. I got the OSF version of a Jack and Coke, which had a cherry infused whiskey (it was dangerous, and at 7 dollars, doubly so), and my mom got a virgin Daquiri- our waitress put extra whip on it. A little touch, but one my mom really appreciated.",0
"By far the best poker room in the state and I have played in every casino poker room in the valley. The action is always there-lots of dead money to be picked up if you know where to look. Good promotions, amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch. I wish they would bring back 6-12 limit but 8-16 will have to do =) such an improvement over the tents, though they will always hold a place in my heart. It sucks cause I work right next to the casino and every night after work I have a tough decision..go home to my family or go to my favorite card room and tear it up. If you havent been there-MUST GO.",1
"This may be fiction.  I don't know for sure.  Here's what I pretty much think happened.

The other night I was at a bar.  two days later I heard that it was Turf.  So I'm gonna go with it.  In body I was there, however my mind was suffering under an oppressive weight called alcohol that blurred pretty much every little thing that happened.

For example: did I really find myself screaming piano man at the top of my lungs, to rapturous applause from the rest of the bar?  every time I tried to stop, I was goaded forth into the next verse?  (did the piano indeed sound like a carnival?)

Was I really and truly told assuredly that I was gay?  Did I really have an argument for what felt like hours with a fair-eyed girl who has severe trust issues and one fucked up gaydar?  despite the wedding ring and total pudgy married-guy look did I still come across as gay?  (my wife tells me that it can only be the broadway rendition of a billy joel song.  I begrudgingly concede)

Did I really hear someone who claimed to be a teacher misrepresent the very definition of a parallelogram?  Did she really say that a parallelogram could not have right angles?  Did I really scoff right at her and throw down the argument-crushing example of the square (QED biatch!)?  Evidently I did, because I do remember her backing me into a corner and beating my ass with a relentless barrage of haymakers, both rights and lefts, that left me bruised like a second-rate (albeit mathematically-savvy) prizefighter the next day.  Her-110 lbs at the very most, me twice that and then some on the most gravitationally-forgiving day, and I had no response but to cower in my own fucked-up rendition of the rope-a-dope.

Her: ""flex your stomach so I can hit you.""
Me: ""Are you joking?  that's me, flexing.""  (#fat)

so I can tell you little to nothing about turf--I genuinely can't say for sure if that was the place we were at.  But since I asked right when I got there if I was allowed to yell, and the bartender said yes, yell to your heart's delight! I have to say four stars.  I would have said 5 but that looks really out of line with the rest of these reviews...",1
"The best caesar salad i have ever had.

The scallops were tasty, but not as crispy as I like them.  My husband loved his steak.

The chocolate lava cake is amazing.  Instead of a little oozing chocolate, there was a lot of oozing chocolate.  And their house chantilly cream is to die for.  I could eat it alone, by the spoonful.",1
"It was almost impossible for me not to stop here on the cab ride back from old town for carne asada fries.mmmm sooo good! I really only went there between the hours of 2-4am but, los betos never let me down.",1
"If we hadn't arrived after a tiring day and prepaid online, I would have checked out.  Furniture missing.  Security bar sheared off.  Faceplates for wiring gone.  Furniture handles missing.  Bobby pins and scraps of things on carpet - hadn't been vacuumed.  Two remaining chairs badly stained.  You wouldn't want to sit on them.  No uniforms or name tags on staff.  Pick another chain.  The reviews for the other Ramada's in the area - which I read after the fact - reflect the same things.",0
"I had to chime in for JOT-C (yep, that's what I call it) because I know it very well, and it's gotten an unjustified bad rap from other Yelpers so far. I've eaten here for over a decade. I've brought friends, college classmates, relatives, and dates here. I lost my dad 3 years ago and I have fond memories of dining here with him. I distinctly remember spilling a Coke all over myself the first time I brought him here. I also remember coming here on my very last day of law school, with a bunch of classmates from Employment Law. The folks here have seen their share of special occasions in my life. Wouldn't be true if this were truly just a 2 star experience. 

I don't think it's fair to nail a restaurant with a bad review based on only a single visit, in most circumstances. Restaurants are run by humans, who are allowed to have a bad day now and then. I've eaten here a billion times. Occasionally something has annoyed me. Most of the time the service is prompt. And those things are true of every restaurant I've ever frequented more than once. At JOTC, even if it's not prompt, it has not even once been unfriendly. There is an elderly gentleman waiter in particular who I especially like. A non-Indian friend I came here with once asked him, ""So, what part of India are you from?"" The waiter look back puzzled and said in his typically mild and hushed manner, ""Sir, I am from Mexico City."" We LOL'd. 

It's #2 on my list of Indian restaurants in the Valley, which is pretty good. Since Tandoori Times is so close by it almost always wins out on a given night, over the past year or so. But the fact remains that JOTC is solidly #2. 

The food is good, by my Indian standards. Samosas: awesome. Chicken tikka masala: very good. I tried the bhindi masala once and that didn't turn out too well. A unique JOTC feature is that dishes are served in very cute, traditional-looking, brass or copper Indian pots. 

Little details like that lead me to say that the decor and atmosphere here probably beat out Tandoori Times and every other Indian place. Simple but elegant, with old Indian art on the walls and cool room dividers thoughtfully placed throughout. The outdoor seating is very pleasant, with heaters to warm you up during winter. The location only adds to the reason to eat here. It's in a cool space next to the Scottsdale Civic Center, a few yards away from AZ 88. It's a solid place to come with a group to eat, drink, and enjoy some good conversation.

JOTC doesn't blow me away (thus only 4 stars), but it needs to be said that if you live in the Valley it is worth at least one visit if you like Indian food, which you wouldn't be able to tell from the other reviews. Judge for yourself.",1
"I'd always heard tales of the fabled Sonic Drive-In, but it was like a whisper in the wind or a thief in the night...I never truly believed. Legends with tantalizing visions of juicy burgers, golden fries, creamy milk shakes, and flavored sodas came across state lines into Los Angeles, but how could such wonders be true? 

What began as an ordinary day would end in a night forever seared into the archives of my mind. As we were blindly driving through the dimly lit streets of Phoenix, an illuminated sign appeared to us, as if an answer to a prayer. Sonic came to us all at once in a haze. We ordered burgers, fries, onion rings, popcorn chicken, a corn dog, chili tots, and shakes upon shakes! Oh, the bargains! We laughed! We danced! We wept! The next morning, all I had was the echo of a stomach ache as proof of the marvels of the night before.

Maybe, just maybe, if I clap my hands enough and really believe, one will suddenly appear in the South Bay. One can only dare to dream.",1
"I have visited Tokyo Stop twice now for an a-ok lunch. There's nothing really bad about Tokyo Stop, but it just hasn't blown my socks off. On my first visit I had the bulgogi plate. It was HUGE. Full of hot marinated beef and a large serving of white rice. I've had bulgogi several times before and this bulgogi is a-ok. Again, not the best I have had, but not bad! I poured Sriracha all over it and I was a happy girl! The second time I visited, I ordered the teriyaki chicken combo. Again, another a-ok dish. Nothing fancy! The prices for each dishs is VERY reasonable. I don't think I've paid over $7 for anything.

I would most certainly visit Tokyo Stop again. They offer a solid lunch at reasonable prices.",0
"Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle. First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter. I am not comfortable doing that anywhere. Who does that? The only place I have ever seen this before was ASU's bookstore. 

Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!! I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out, yikes!) Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes. 

If they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning??? IN ARIZONA?? Madness!",0
"Sam, Sven, and all the vendors here make the market special.",1
"We didnt feel like going out and decided to order in.  Compared to most delivery restaurants of this style, we were happy not to get a salt bomb for a meal.  Only quibbles were ordering two larges and only getting one rice and their online menu not being accurate with regards to pricing.  Good flavor on the Kung pao.",0
"Even though I don't drink beer, I've been going to Rock Bottom since I lived in San Diego. And have always had a decent experience.

I stopped in for lunch. I got the Mac and cheese with NO chicken , it comes with a salad.
Huge portions, Cold plate and chilled fork for the salad was a nice touch. The Mac and cheese was piping hot and really good. (see pics)

Two people could have shared the mac and cheese, I couldn't finish it, even though I wanted to.

Friendly waitress, refilled my drink and brought my check in a timely manner.",1
"The facility is very clean and I got in and out quick.  However, the staff lacks personality and friendliness.",0
One of my regular buffet stops. great service and average food.,1
Great food!  Great atmosphere! Great service.  Definitely recommend!!,1
"I resisted eating Zoyo for months after they opened because I was afraid I'd get hooked and be there every day. And, yep, it's addictive. They always have new flavors to try, but right now my fave is salted caramel. It's incredible. I usually pass on toppings.

As other have suggested, it'd be nice if they had smaller containers. But I am impressed that they can keep the store so clean with the giant roll-up doors open. They lead to a nice patio that's sufficiently removed from the street that you're not just breathing exhaust.",1
Very Hip Hotel and Comfortable ~ Amazing location ~Great Staff all is good at the Valley HO !!!,1
"Great prices and service. The delivery process could be improved but for the price and peace of mind with the Costco warranty process you cant go wrong. 

High quality furniture and very low prices.",1
"Superb gelato - some of the best I've ever had! The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato.

They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil.

I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut... it was sublime. 

Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had. When I need a mid day sugar rush... I'll be back!",1
"Food was good, service was great! If I didn't eat at Chili's so much inn the past, I would definitely go back, but since coming back to the US, many more other restaurants to try.....",1
Heard about this restaurant from a friend and I was amaze by the food and their friendly service. I tried the chicken adobo and it was amazing! The chicken came apart with no effort and it had a great honey glazed taste. The portions were a good amount for their low prices. I couldn't  get enough of their amazing dessert!,1
"This gym is great...  I joined because it opened only about 3 minutes away from my house.  I keep going back because every person who works there is so nice and greets you with a smile and a friendly hello.  It is not intimidating at all, which is a big step up from the LA Fitness that I used to go to.  The staff gets to know you by name and most of the other members are quite friendly as well.   The gym is open enough that you can do free weights on your own without bumping into anyone and there are always plenty of cardio machines available.   I've been going there for over a year and plan to continue doing so!",1
"False ads, do not stay there. Unless you don't mind a dirty, smelly, overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor ""cabana suites"" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The ""suites"" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an ""out of order"" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!",0
"If you want a deal for your buck, this is the place to go! You'll find Dewalt, Makita, Oster, Cuisinart, Farberware, Keurig, and many other banded items for a fraction of the original retail price. Yes, some items will be out the package, missing a manual, or may have a scratch or a dent but I rather pay a fraction of the price versus paying full retail at a department store. I rather save money and get a ridiculous deal for the same exact item I would have paid 10X more at a well organized and clean shop. From what I know this store has been open for nearly ten years; the owners are one of the nicest people I've met; they even offer free delivery with the furniture or any other large item you purchase. Stop by!! You'll get a kick from just walking down the unorganized, messy aisles; but once you get to the register to pay- you'll be happy!! ""Get more for less!""",1
You know......first when my girl dragged me here....i thought it will suck. Once I stepped in....well....BAM! Interesting colors fill my senses. I do appreciate the set up of this place and the quirky items I found. So yea it is a chick store but still managed to entertain me.,1
"I love the Salt Cellar for being the lazy woman's go-to place for seafood.  If you get lobster or crab from them, the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here, while technically from Maine, is flown in fresh from Boston, and they offer 1.25 lb, 3 lb, and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.

While the sides are very basic, the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster, I did try some salmon wellington, which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist, and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season, which is one of my favorite seafood items.

The ambiance itself, for me at least, is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing, for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs, it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.  The lighting for me is too yellow for me, and everything in general seems antiquated.  I remember eating here years and years ago, and it seems like they haven't changed anything about the decor since then!",1
"Ok, so I've just come to the conclusion that it's not me....... it's YOU.

I just don't like other peoples used, worn, busted up shit. That said, I really like My Sisters Closet. I've only been in a couple of times but I know potential when I see it in the form of a $400 Louis Vuitton bag. ( I wouldn't purchase it but I liked that it was there) I did pick up a pair of designer (not sure which one, don't really care) sunglasses for $14. Sure, they are probably *gasp* ""last season's"" or whatever but I don't care. They look hot and they cover almost my entire face which is something I look for in shades.

I will be back soon to see what other goodies I can find. That $400 Louis really made me nervous though. Who has so much dough that they can just drop a perfectly good $1200 bag at consignment??........ and are they interested in adopting or marrying me...",1
"Very good food.  Our service was great--thank you, Heather.  She guided us to some good wines and food recommendations.  We'll be back",1
"Love the buffet, the folks that work there are great, we usually hit this at least once a weekend and our table is always ready and he knows what sort of naan we want. Small but worth it.",1
"You can get a 3 course meal here for lunch for under $20.  Most entrees are in the mid teens and include appetizer/salad or soup, entree, and dessert.  A selection of bread and butter is available for you to snack on as well.  

Comparing the other culinary restaurants I've eaten at, I'd say this one serves OK food, but the others are better in preparation and taste.  I had the salmon and ravioli appetizer, which tasted OK, albeit too salty due to the salt crust on the salmon, and the ravioli innards leaked out of the pasta into the bowl it was served in, making it look less appetizing.  The entree itself was (poisson rouge) tasted good and was well prepared, but the dessert (black forest cake) mousse was too runny.  

Service from our main waitress was good.  Our water server was probably the most awkward server I've encountered, and he forgot to bring out some items I requested but hey, I give him points for trying.  One thing that was weird was that one of the instructors came over and made a snide remark on how I wanted bread for my dessert because I was trying to finish the last piece of bread on the table (I hate wasting food).",0
"This is a super cute restaurant with a simple yet delicious menu. They stick to basics which I love. They also have a vintage items that you can admire and purchase. Its a great place if you want a quick, simple, cheap yet delicious meal. Their shakes are amazing as well as their potato salad. YUM! If you are in the area, check it our for sure!",1
"We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town. So I've probably been here atleast 10 times.

Love their steak with buttered plates. We've had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction. But after being there so many times I know how to order it. Sweet potato casserole is excellent. Cesar salad is the best I've ever had. On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly, but I've had it before where they are like buzzing bees. I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice. 

The atmosphere is good. It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room.

Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner, don't cheap out on a babysitter. Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who can't sit still. Ruth Chris should have an age requirement!

I've been to Mortons twice. Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasn't as good as Ruth Chris.",1
I had a facial with Jennifer and it was fantastic!  She used all proper techniques and overall it was a very relaxing and wonderful experience.  Would definitely recommend this spa for anyone living or vacationing in the area.,1
"After living 2 blocks away for over a year, i finally took the jump and decided to deal with the long wait to try this place out.  Got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night... 2.5 hour wait.  (To be expected, but still pretty ridiculous.)  

Went next door to Bar Bianco, ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited outside.  I think that the wait is part of the allure for people.  Also, after waiting hungry for 3 hours, the food becomes tastier because you are starving.  

Finally get a table at 10:15.  Order the caprese salad and another bottle of wine.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The Mozz is excellent, the tomatoes are very very fresh and tasty and the basil was great as well.  

The server didnt make any recommendations on wine or food.  A bit odd.  Given that the wait is 3 hours and that it's pricy for a pizza joint, you'd think that the service would be excellent.  Not at all the case.  This guy acts like everyone here is a regular.  The reality is that with 3 hour waits for a table, i don't have time to be a regular at this place. 

We ordered 2 pizzas to try.... Biancoverde and Wiseguy.  They were pretty good, again with good ingredients.  I wouldn't say it was the best pizza i've ever had, but very tasty.  Asked for some Balsamic to go with the Mozz and Tomatoes... had to ask the server 2 times, finally we snagged a food runner, she got it for us.  I shouldnt have to ask for something 3 times. I mean really, this place only has like 6 tables... pay attention to the guests.  

I guess the moral here is that trying this place is all about the experience and saying that you've been there.  While Bianco is good you can go to Parlor or Cibo and get very good (comparable) pizza without a 3 hour wait.  

Is it good, yes. 
Is it worth the wait, nope.",0
"Third time back.  This is my 9 year old daughter's favorite restaurant for special celebrations.  Maybe because the portions are sized for her.  

Just kidding.  Sort of.

Always good food.  Sometimes terrific.  But never consistently, hit the ball out of the park good.  

The bill creeps up on you.  We can't ever seem to walk out the door with less than $80-120 bill for 2-3.  

Last night, had the filet.  At maybe 5 ournces, bigger and more substantial than the last time, when I think I paid $32 for 2 ounces.  Seriously.

Last time the steak was perfect.  This time, they overcooked it, but I didn't have the heart to send it back.  So my wife ate it and enjoyed it, and I got her salmon.

Salmon was just okay.  BUT, the bed of rissoto, one of my favorite dishes, was delightfully rich and creamy.

Overall, it's not a terrible value.  And it's a cute little french restaurant.  COMPLETELY and totally not appropriate for small children, so don't even try.  Great date place.

Whatever you do, you MUST try two things:  

1) Onion Tart - it's just a slice and a side salad as an appetizer, but OH what a slice.

2) Berry Tart - the deserts are what makes this place go.  Save room.  

Remember this:

IF YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT WITH TART IN ITS NAME, AND DON'T ORDER A TART... well, what can I say.  Just don't do it.

Will be back, as I always have, and will promise to only feel slightly mugged next time I pay the bill.",0
"Sam is da man.

I was very impressed with the fare here. I had a bowl with noodles and chicken on my first outing, and it was awesome. Another time I came I felt way hungry, so I ordered the SUMO bowl. Whoa. The bowl is a 32 oz bowl, I could have had it all chicken though. The beef is meh. I agree with another yelper that the eggrolls are subpar. They are grilled I guess? I dunno, lame. At another location they had these ""carnival"" cookies that were awesome. Another variety of cookies were the butterscotch. OMG. Amazin. So yes... Sam is da man.",0
"we ate there this past saturday evening. arrived in time to take advantage of the 50% off wine price, which was great.  they have an extensive offering of wines, with emphasis on chilean and argentinian. delicious. ordered the fig/prosciutto salad that was wonderful. my companion ordered the salami/proscuitto/olive plate that came with bread and crackers. he ordered sangria. everything was very tasty. we sat outside. the atmosphere is so welcoming. had a great waiter. really enjoyed ourselves. we will absolutely go back.",1
"Great place - nice ambiance, cool decor, tasty food and good service!
We were going to check out the Spotted Donkey, but finding it out of business, we noticed Grassroots across the parking lot and decided to check it out.  My daughter got the brisket sandwich (she let me try a bite - nice combination of BBQ sauce, slaw and pickles - but she picked out the pickles and slaw!)  The fries were quite nice as well.  I tried the short ribs - asian fusion sauce with asparagus and jalapeño cheesy grits...I've never been a fan of grits, but these were tasty!  The ribs were very nice...the sauce reminded me of something my Mom used to make (but I can't quite put my finger on what it was, but it was familiar).  A browned with toffee flakes and gelato on top capped off a very nice dinner.  (And you've gotta love a place that has the Gadsden flag as part of it's decor).  Definitely will be coming back!  (and my apologies to our attentive and helpful server for not having been more demonstrative of my appreciation for the food...it was quite good, I just wasn't in a 'dang that's good!' mood last night)  Check this place out!!",1
"If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains, beans, Freeze Dried fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy...they have a wonderful selection. They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens. I'm a big fan!",1
"I hate the heat. HATE. Yet I am doomed to reside in this heat haven so when my best friend raved about a place where you can sit outside in Arizona and not feel the heat I had to check it out. By the time I ventured downtown to glance at this place Phoenix was experiencing a cool down so the patio was very comfortable without the fans and misters. 

Our waitress was great and even chatted about our night and my favorite bar, SideBar. We got the L.B. favorite lavosh and I okayed the bacon even though it didn't sound too appetizing. It wasn't. I ordered some chicken sandwich that was on a french roll. The salad on the side was better than the sandwich. My friend ordered the classic turkey which was large but average. BUT I think ordering the classic sandwich was a boring mistake of its own. The fries that came with the turkey were greasy and when I ordered a amber ale and some guy brought a pale ale. I like pale ale so it wasn't too bad but it made me yearn for the amber. Yes, or course I ordered the amber next.

The waitress told us that the island bar was opening the next day but there were still ladders and paint cans lying around. I failed to notice until my friend mentioned it. The only really cool thing about this place is that it is in a historic building with strange bathrooms. Other than that I would skip it.",0
"A comfortable little wine shop situated just south of Old Town Scottsdale.  Every Thursday they bring in a distributor or vintner to showcase a set of wines at their bar and collection of tables set off to the side.  For $15 you usually taste five or six wines of decent quality, the best part to the price is that $10 of each tasting goes into purchasing a bottle of one of the wines tasted. The atmosphere is quite an eclectic mix of high-brow, with food and clientele from Atlas Bistro migrating in, and casual.  The people running the place couldn't be more nice or more knowledgable in the wines they sell either.  The prices may be a touch above somewhere like BevMo, but if you're looking for the perfect wine to go with gnocchi in a basil cream sauce, these are the guys to ask!",1
"I went here last year when I was in AZ, I thought it was God's gift to Mexican food... I was a bit tipsy last year when I went there... I went again last week, it was ""ehhhh"". Don't get me wrong, still good, but not as wonderful as I remembered... not even close. 

We had to wait an hour for a table, the waiter made us wait about 15 minutes (not kidding) for water and chips/salsa... Seriously, 15 minutes? You dumbass! 

The desserts were super good though, that was the upside...",0
Fun place for breakfast.  Prices were reasonable and food was good.,1
"Mouth watering. That's all I have to say.

The food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. The scallops were a highlight, as was the potato pie dish (that's not a very technical name for what it was, but that's my best effort). It was all very, very good, and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost! We genuinely enjoyed our evening here, and we will absolutely go back, but it is pricey, especially for the size of the dishes.

The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun, and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places we've been in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this for a night out with friends, or a cool date night. It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea, although we didn't have them and were okay (it was busy, though).",1
"Fast service, attentive waiter, food cooked as I ordered, clean restrooms...What more could I ask for? I was on my way to a meeting at the Marriott so I stopped in to grab lunch beforehand. I was in an out in less than 45 minutes. Perfect.

I'll be back the next time I am at the Desert Ridge mall looking for a place to grab a quickbite to eat without ordering fast food.",1
"I really love this place.  The girls that work there crack me up and they can get you in and out quicker than anywhere else in the Marketplace.  Their prices are decent and their food is great.  The orange chicken is some of my favorite.  This place is very much like Panda Express but thankfully doesn't have that terrible Panda flavor (eww, panda flavor).  Bri sums up this place pretty well.",1
"Although they didn't have what I was looking for, the help was friendly and the store was very nicely kept. And they had a decent selection of course everything is a dollar. So I said "" you guys are okay in my book (A-OK) one of the good ones"" so I won't rule them out when I'm looking for dollar deals.",0
"I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix, I was able to get two classes in at their studio. It was very clean and the people were friendly. I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me. 

I would defiantly return if I were in the area again.",1
"A dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets. But on the 12th floor of the Acme building, one man is trying to find the answers to life's persistent questions: Guy Noir, Private Eye. (THEME) 

It was a night in November. November 23rd in fact. I remember the date because it was my birthday. The snow birds that had started to flock from their summer homes had long since retired for the evening and the godfearing people of Phoenix had closed shop. My two lovely companions and I were looking for a place to fill our bellies. Like moths to a flame we were attracted to a dim light coming from a dark parking lot. We exited the car.

""Are you going to Mama Mia's?""

A beautiful petite girl with the kind of body men write home about stepped out of the shadows. I was going wherever she took me.

We were led through the kind of kitchen you only see in mob movies. I wasn't going to ask what they put in the sausage.

We stepped in and figured out our toppings. Trying to figure out toppings for one pizza between three people you may as well be figuring out cold fusion with a box of toothpicks and some masking tape. But with the plethora of options I felt like I had a bag of bananas in a monkey whore house and we narrowed it to basil and fresh tomato.

The pizza was exactly what a tired and famished private eye like myself needed on a night like this.

Man working  register- ""Is that a wig?""

Jetta-"" Yeah its a wig.""

We left the pizza joint as happy as a twister in a trailer park.

Jetta- ""I am so getting a weave.""

"Arai pastry is so delicious!
ironically i come here not for the sweeties: confections, cakes, cookies, cremes, not being my style- but for their delicious savory treats! The breads they make here are top knotch, the various salty pastries are all worth exploring, the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites. But the real deal, the Coup de grâce, the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop (in my mind) is their sandwhiches/ green tea shakes
that powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimes
yes yes
i find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy",1
"A yummy-in my tummy cozy spot! I met a friend for lunch here and was pleasantly surprised. The food is full of flavor and very reasonable. They give you huge portions, and the service is very friendly. I got a salad and the caprese bruchetta. What a perfect combo! The bold garlic taste of the bruschetta, washed down by a light salad. My salad had the perfect amount of dressing. I wish we had this place in So Cal, I would definitely come more often!",1
"I just celebrated my birthday at Oregano's.  I had the best server I have had the pleasure of meeting in a lonnnnng time.  ASK FOR ALEXANDRA.  Knowledgable, adorable!, attentive, funny, and charming to boot!  Amazing pizza and salad, fab cocktails we'd never heard of, and to-die-for dessert.  All per her recommendations.  Can't wait to come here again.",1
"Fun bar. Gets PACKED during happy hour, and on weekends after 9pm. Sometimes the music is a little too loud to hold a dinner conversation. But hey maybe I'm just getting old.

The sushi is CONSISTENTLY good, above average good. Yes, as other reviewers noted, you can find better. But no other sushi place I've been to in Arizona can consistently serve up good fish every time I come in.",1
"Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the ""odd"" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!",1
"I was put up here after not making a flight (the woman I talked to at the gate blamed Orbitz for not scheduling enough time to make a connection). True. But then a really nice man hooked me up with a voucher for this hotel accomodation!

I didn't realize that ALL the Embassy suites do the Manager's happy hour in the evenings; this one was 5:30 - 7:30...But let me back it up a bit. My whole experience here was wonderful.

A nice man, Terry, drove the shuttle from the airport and was very helpful giving me some ""things to do ideas"" around the area - movie theatre, shopping mall...etc. When we pulled up to the front he even pointed out a restaurant next door, 7-11 and CVS. I was super tired from my flight so it was nice that he took the time to point things out since I was not paying attention.

I went inside and checked in- very fast and smooth. The FD clerk even offered me a beverage- hot coffee/tea/cocoa.  She even told me how to access the internet free of charge.  I found my room quite quick and going inside was so refreshing!

I had an immense amount of space for just me, as these acommodations are suites. The little kitchenette was stocked with tea and coffee and ice machine was just around the corner, not too far of a walk.  It was extremely chilly in the room so after I found the thermostat, I turned it to be warmer- I ended up turning it off I was so cold.  I did a quick flip through of TV channels but didn't find anything I wanted to watch. And then I tried to connect to internet- fast and easy.  I called to see about getting a bathrobe and some toothpaste and it was brought up in less than 10 minutes!

I thought about going sightseeing and ended up taking a nap. I didn't realize how tired I was!  The bed was great! Comfy and warm!  I didn't want to get up!  But I ended up getting up so I could go to CVS across the street for a few needed items.

Next morning when I left, there was nothing I needed to do to check out and the shuttle service back to the airport was very prompt. 

I wouldn't mind staying here again should I be stopping through town or stuck overnight on an unforseen layover!

"Pizza Venice has, hands down, the best pizza in the Valley. In my mind, they've got the best bang for your buck with the XL three-topping pizza deal. Get that with the garlic crust, and you're buying pizza nirvana. It doesn't hurt that the owners are incredibly friendly. Why would I even consider ordering terrible chain pizza when I can get a great pizza for a great price from a locally owned business?",1
"We were taken here by our host in Phoenix.  It's one of the prettiest Mexican restaurants I've been in, with a courtyard surrounding a duck pond (there is a sign requesting you not feed the ducks tortilla chips!).

The margaritas were great and my chicken was excellent, as were my partner's tequila shrimp.  Would definitely go back there if I were to visit Phoenix again.",1
Great food. Service consistently blows. Sit at the bar and you will be fine.,1
"tip: if ordering in the drive thru - either there is no speaker system or it's out of order - when the person wearing an apron walks up to the side of the menu and stares into your car that means ""Hi, can I take your order"" There was a few seconds of awkward silence and wondering WTH this person was looking in the car for before we figured out she was there to take our order :)

Since moving to the west valley from southern CA we've been itchin' to find a replacement for Alberto's or Taco San Pedro. Humberto's reminds me of awesome hole in the wall type Mexican food, but unfortunately still leaves something to be desired.

With that said here's info on what we had:
If you're from So Cal and have had Northgate's shrimp ceviche Humberto's comes awfully close.  Verdict - Ceviche - good.
Cheese quesadilla - cheesy - did the job
Nachos - good

If you've been out late partying it up and need to satisfy the munchies monster Humberto's should do.",0
"Westgate has a few more restaurants now but stil need more shops for shopping to come along.  It is starting to build up but slowly.  It was nice to walk around from dinner, but the amount of teenage kids there were a little annoying.  Guess I am not the mommy type!",0
"If I was on death row and had to choose a meal for my ""last supper"" I would include the New Mexico Skillet (hold the chorizo) from Butters. 

I have searched high and low for any other breakfast place that compares to Butters and I cannot find anything. I thought that I had found a close contender in Perk Eatery in North Scottsdale but a second visit proved that they were not consistent.

Butters is consistently amazing. The service is strangely fast but you'd have to be crazy to complain about that. Their menu is creative and there is a really great variety of food. I always want to try the crepes or french toast but I just can't bring myself to get anything other than the New Mexico skillet. Maybe one day I'll branch out.",1
"Had to bring my wife's necklace here to be repaired. Service was great, the pretty looking girls were very helpful. In all, we had a very good experience. Looks like we will be coming back soon. Wife had her eyes on something?",1
"Thai??? Really?? I love Thai food and couldn't be happier to try a new restaurant. Wow! It was a slap in the face on so many levels. The 2 hostesses were the rudest I have had the displeasure of having to interact with. We ordered take out and as we waited for out food from the kitchen the hostesses made us uncomfortable... As if we were imposing on there entry.
The food was not spectacular. We ordered pad Thai , was very dry but not horrible. The sweet or sour beef was watery and seemed more like fajita with way too many peppers. No  sticky rice, green papaya salad, Larb...",0
"First off nothing gourmet going on here at all. Its basically Subway with free delivery and they have to deliver it for free or there is no way in hell you would bother with the place. It's cheap, generic, flavorless food.",0
"Good food, great atmosphere, great service and great prices! We will definitely be back! Can't wait to try the Sunday Brunch!",1
"Had the pastrami sandwich. It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami. It was good.  Good food hAs the power of time travel. 

This is a great place. Plus the coke is primo. Good mixture. The ice makes it over the top.",1
"I love the place.  Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it, and it turned out to be quite good.  They even have a few choices for those that aren't into Asian fare.",1
"I met some friends here for lunch, the menu is a weird mosh of Italian, Mexican and American food....it is almost like they can't figure out what kind of restaurant they want to be. 

I ordered the cheese enchiladas which was probably the wrong choice at a non-Mexican restaurant, but I just wasn't feeling anything else. The two people who were with me got their food, and I was still waiting, and waiting and waiting. Finally the waitress came over and asked if anyone had been here to talk to me...isn't that her job? She said that they gave my dish to someone else by accident, so they are making me a ""fresh"" plate. 

My enchiladas finally arrive, and look like they were just slopped on the plate. i take a bite and guess what? They were barely warm! You would think that a ""fresh"" plate would be served piping hot! I took a few bites, but by now I was over them and late for a meeting. 

A waitress that was different than ours brought over our check, which included my enchiladas. I told her what the problem was, but she didn't seem to speak English very well and said she would go ask someone. They did take them off the bill, but that really should have been done automatically since the other people at my table were done with their food before I even got mine! 

The decor is odd too, it is like they are trying to be a sports bar, but maybe aren't sure, evidenced by the 6 plasma TVs sitting in the corner still in their boxes! 

If I have a say in the matter....I won't be returning to Deemos.",0
"Business takes me out to Mesa yesterday.  After chatting with a friend about possible lunch locations, he tells me about Georges Gyros, near University and Country Club.  I decide to give it a try, as it isn't too far from my destination.  Situated right next door to Sun Devil Liquors, I'm surprised I hadn't been there before, or, for that matter, even noticed it.  I guess when I hit SDL, I've got tunnel vision.  First thing I notice is there appears to be plenty of parking, even at 12:30, for lunch.  Outer patio, stuck out into the parking lot, not overly appealing, might be nicer in the evening, I guess?  The interior is clean, plenty of seating, a small bar at one end, and a counter from which you place your order.  Never having been before, I ask the counter-person for a recommendation.  ""What's good?""  He suggests the Original Gyro, served with fries or a greek salad.  Sounds good, I'll take it with fries.  With drink, under $9.  A few moments later (actually, I saw three other tables get served, so it seemed like a longish wait), a ginormous gyro arrives, with a huge helping of fries.  The gyro was huge, overflowing with, umm, meat, gyro meat, I guess, white onions, diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki, I think).  The meat was well cooked, artfully shaved, and tender.  The sauce was also very good.  The pita?  Warm, soft and tasty.  The fries? Crisp and golden brown, and piping hot, about 3-4 times the size of Mickie D's or about 1/2 a 'steak fry'.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the dining area, and the presence of a bar.  Most folks were eating gyros, or good sized greek salads.  Other items on the menu include several different gyros, burgers, sandwiches, a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers.  I plan on coming back, perhaps before a foray into Sun Devil Liquors...",1
"I see a few of the previous reviews discussing issues with service, but I have always had good service at this place.  I have only been in a handful of times, but we never have to wait very long to be helped, and the staff is very friendly.
I have only ordered salads there, but I've enjoyed the three that I've tried (Maggie's, Jamaican Jerk Chicken, and Greek).  The salad dressing always comes on the side, which is perfect, because that is how I like to order salads (so I can control the amount of dressing.)  My husband loves the pulled pork, although it's popular and sells out pretty quickly from our experience.",1
"Its refreshing to find one-of-a-kind places -- God knows Phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic, strip-mall, chains-on-every-corner valley. Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building.

The dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased.

They serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as ""Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo."" It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not ""lime"". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food.

On another recent visit I ordered a wrap called ""Prince of Thai's - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla."" That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks.

One thing I think That's A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is ""Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet"" and they have a link for a new restaurant ""Green"" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought That's A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only.",0
"I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it. I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's.",0
"I'm very new to PHX. I ended up talking to a cop at the airport who told me about Thursday Rockabilly nights at the Blooze. I had to check it out. My friend and I walked in and were instantly comfortable, excited, and impressed. The AC was pumping, beer was cold, the music; rockin, and the crowd; refreshing. The bathroom was great! 
They don't have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want. We went there pretty early, around 7:30ish. Unfortunately, because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM, I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 10:30/11. I am so glad that I finally checked the place out though. I will definitely frequent The Blooze as often as I can.",1
"This is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot. Fresh bagels and different types of cream cheese.

They even have Bagel Thins for those who are cutting their carbs. 

You don't pay the person who took you order, but move down the line to pay for your food.

Their iced coffee are a great deal!! It's a 20oz cup for less than $3!",1
Fresh and Easy's are great.  My only issues is how quickly some of the foods from this store go bad.  Don't buy for a week from now unless it is frozen!,1
"I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.  

The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.  

There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!",1
"The absolute worse service I've encountered. My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well. 

The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers. 

I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern. 

Again, food is great service is lousy. I am so disappointed and will not go back. I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls. I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable.",0
"A total oasis from the summer heat.  This friendly and well stocked neighborhood library is never crowded, so you can alway grab a free PC or a free table if you're lugging your own laptop.  The selection of books and dvds are really good too.",1
"Really good pizza has to be among the most perfect foods in all the world.  Really good pizza would likely be on my last meal request list.  Specifically the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza at La Grande Orange Pizzeria which has to be near the top of the list for all the great pizzas the two us who contributed to this review have consumed.  And that is a lot of pizza.

We were visiting Scottsdale as tourists when the concierge at the resort recommended this place to us.  Bless her.  Very convenient too to be able to shop for wine at La Grande Orange grocery, adjoining, and other goodies while we waited on our take out pizza order.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix#hrid:4cXbhzxxtmExF9kRjmFViQ/src:self

The only hitch here is parking is terrible during peak hours. So it goes.  The pizza is worth the parking hassle.  We're on our way back to Scottsdale in a few days for another visit and La Grande Orange Pizzeria is on our ""go"" list again. The Rocket Man pizza is calling our name this time.",1
Took Travis here for one of our first dates and just LOVE Cibo.  It's situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and it's definitely a place for a cool date.,1
"Love the location and the re-purposed historical house 
Stoked that the tortillas are fully warmed like a good tortilla should be. 
Crave the creamy, non-lard beans even more than the carne asada. 
Diggin the outdoor picnic tables. 
Hesitant to order the corn because sometimes it has too much sauce n cheese, which overpower the pure joy of grilled corn. 
Not so crazy about my last experience where the cashiers showed more personality talking to each other or the kitchen crew than they did to me while taking my order. I'm paying $6 for a burrito, could it hurt to smile and maybe offer me a happy hour beer when I'm here picking up my take out dinner?",0
Who doesn't like a good carne asada burrito? No one doesn't that's who. It's rudunk,1
"Until Bobby Q's entered my life i wasnt a fan of BBQ anything! made me kinda sad to see so many people enjoying some messy ribs but anyways I i digress...This place has changed my life for the better!. Their St. Louis ribs are fall off the bone AMAZING! and their Mac n Cheese is a must have! I have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob, if something doesnt come close to Bobby Q's i automatically right that place off.

A short review but you get the gist of it...",1
"Clean establishment. Rows of freezers in the back. Hidden from the street. Greeted by name what must be one of the regulars. Carries both Modelo and Dos Equis. Slowly made food for being dead. The green enchilada sauce is a must. Green chile chimis are fantastic.

For the price, it was certainly filling and enjoyable. A place to come back to if you're craving decent Mexican in a sit-down environment but are too far away from a Blue Burrito Grille.",1
"Oh, where to begin..

I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed, they told me it was a 45min wait for two.. wow.  The place was packed.   The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend, so we made one for Friday at 7PM.

The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside.  

I'm so glad we did. 

We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen, it was seating time.  I think we waited maybe ten minutes.

After gazing over the menu for a quick minute, we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce.  Being one to enjoy new things, I was pretty excited.  The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer.  The place at this point was insanely packed, but it was nice to see a place like this.  Made ya feel that something good was to come.  Heck, a place cant' suck if it's this packed, right?   So we order our food, I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things.  It would be a share-a-meal night.. 

About 10min into drinks and conversation, they bring out the fried alligator..  Ok, if you've never eaten anything weird before.  Please please.. you've got to try this.  It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken.  The taste literally melted in my mouth.  To top it off, the creole sauce that went with it, only complimented it.  I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone.  Sadly, I had to share..

After quickly destroying the fried alligator, we got our entrees.  I took one bite and had to pause a moment.. the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab, Alfredo, spices inside just floored me.  There were only six pieces, but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans, this was plenty of food. 

I can't wait for my next trip here.. fantastic food.",1
"I admit it I eat donuts almost everyday and twice on Sundays. Today a I found a new addiction, french crullers, uhhh they are soo good. Melt in your mouth.",1
"This place is a bit difficult to find granted but well worth the effort. If you're shopping down at the farmer's market, need a place to study, or just want to plop down with a good book, Fair Trade will caffeinate you as well as  feed you such tasties as quiches, stuffed croissants, cookies, bagels, and sandwiches.  

The cafe was run by the church up until Julyish in answer to Mr. K's musing but they've been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours.  They're also hopefully expanding they're menus to include more food food items as volume picks up. 

Additionally, they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee.",1
"Great addition to the CityScape lineup!  This is a big place with TONS of beers on tap, sweet cushy leather seats and friendly employees.  So far I've only been for happy hour, which is great because they offer deep discounts on local beers.  I'm definitely looking forward to sampling some of the food options.  
My one complaint - most of the songs we heard here (I've yet to see a live band here) were horribly outdated top 40 hits that I wish I had forgotten about.  Clearly that's a matter of taste though ;)
Looking forward to going back!",1
"Went there with my date on Thursday night; it was quite empty.

I don't think the decoration is as nice as it said in other reviews; it's about alright.

The issue I found is waiter walks pass in front of you during the movie. The color of the screen is yellowish that makes movie look old. 

It's more like watching a DVD at home. When watching movies, I don't like to be interrupted, so the waiter service during the movie really bothers me. 

The good thing is it's very close to my house, I can go there on foot.",0
"I had several mothers tell me about Eduprize and how great it was. I was a little nervous when I was told there is a waiting list and you have to agree to put time in the classroom. Now that I am in the classroom volunteering, I realize why it is so great. I can see first hand why my daughter struggles in some areas and does great in others. I can see how the others are struggling too and I can be apart of helping them, even if it is just for a day. This school's requirement to have parents volunteer is something ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD DO!",1
"As far as basic burgers go this is an OK option. The flavor is ok and basic toppings give everyone enough choice. Better than McDonald's yeah and similar to In-n-Out but nothing really special. Price is not cheap for a burger so I would expect a little more, but not more fries because they give you a bucket full and more.",0
I have been here twice so I know what's the best items for my taste. Would give another star if the Mongolian grill had more items and sauces. Trying the evening buffet tomorrow with 2 teenage son's one whose 18 and a football player. Should definitely get my moneys worth!,1
Just left. I wanted to eat another pizza it was that good.  The Biagga was fantastic. Probably the best prosciutto style pizza I've ever had.  Owner and staff were very friendly.   I will be back again.,1
"So much better that 5 Dorks, I mean guys.  They have salads and great chicken selections!",1
"In my opinion, there is nothing better than a delicious salad chock-full of a combination of fruit, nut and cheese.  The Organic Spinach and Cranberry salad with chicken is pretty much the stuff dreams are made of (well, delicious salad dreams at least).  The salad is so flavorful that you hardly even need to use the dressing.  I could eat this salad every day, but, alas, its quite pricey at nearly $12.00",1
"I love Los Favoritos!  Mi favorito is the chorizo breakfast burrito (most popular item there?).  Interestingly enough, I think it's bigger if you order it for dinner than for breakfast, but for either it's plenty big!  Muy rico with salsa verde.  I'm embarrassed to say that I've only had a few of other things on the menu (quesadilla and other burritos), but they've all been delish!  For some reason, though, I just get my mouth set on chorizo burrito.  It's seductive.
The folks there are very nice and sincere, and they know English well enough, although I think some are working on it.  
Tip:  You can order ahead!  Especially helpful if you're going during the lunch rush, when it seems like every kid from Seton H.S. is there.  it's pretty nice to breeze in and pay and grab your stuff when there's a gaggle of folks still waiting for their order to be called.    
Tip 2:  If you don't order ahead, you can place your order there and then go across the courtyard to Starbucks to grab a coffee (that probably costs more than what you got at Los Fav's) while you wait for your food, if you're so inclined.  This is a bad habit you might not want to get into.  Believe me!",1
"I am not only new to the area, but to the southwest. I'm so excited to try food from as many taquerias as possible to find my favorite. Taqueria Los Angeles is yummy and super inexpensive. $5 for ""your choice of two"" with rice and beans. I will certainly return.",1
"Seriously, their happy hour prices can't be beat.  A beer, a spicy tuna roll, calamari and avocado egg roll for under $20 including tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We had to lurk around the bar area for awhile to get a table, but that only speaks to how popular this place is.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dinner out that doesn't involve Denny's or Olive Garden this is a great choice.",1
"I came here on a strong recommendation from a friend. After reading the reviews, I was anxious to try it out. I went on a Saturday night, half expecting it to be really busy. We were seated in about five minutes or less. Not busy on a Saturday night...made me kind of worried. 

The menu is sparse, it made ordering really easy.  Service was fairly slow considering the small amount of people in the restaurant. Refills were slow, service was kind of inattentive but not rude. Our pizza came out in about 15-20 mins. We ordered a white with garlic with pepperoni and sausage. The pizza looked and smelled delicious, but that's where it all went bad.

First off, the pizza crust was really soggy because of all the grease under the pizza. I have never ate such a greasy pizza in my life. i had to drain every single slice, it literally created a puddle on my plate. There was a significant lack of sauce on my pizza, some parts of my crust were bare, not even a hint of red on them. The pepperoni and the sausage tasted great and there was enough toppings on the pizza to justify the $2 price tag. 

The non soggy areas of crust were great, and the cheese was amazing. We ended up taking half the pizza home, the slices were filling. The pizza was better the next day, after the box absorbed most of the grease, after throwing away the pizza box, the bottom of the box was saturated in grease. I'm not sure if grease makes a quality pizza, but in this case it just made a soggy crust.

**Update** Under intense pressure I came back here and tried a white with chicken, they seriously redeemed themselves. I spoke to the manager and he insisted my last time was a fluke and should have been corrected. I would come back on occasion.",1
"AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.

You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.

Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.

They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.

Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)",1
"Cibo is positively adorable.  I love the atmosphere.  I love the little house, and the yard.  I love the excessively busy yet amazingly friendly servers.  I love the iced tea.  I love the bread.  I love the Antipasto plate.  I love making ad-hoc bruchetta out of said bread and Antipasto.  I love the margherita pizza.

Just on a Thursday afternoon alone, I don't think I'd ever come with a large group of people.  It just doesn't seem like a wise life decision.

Really? It's love overall.  Love, love, love, love.  When I can, I'm dragging my family here.",1
"Glad to say this place is still going strong a little over a year after my first visit/review. Wanna try it? Then visit on a Tuesday night for $1 tacos and $2 cervezas! They have amazingly good Tacos and Salsa, and an excellent Tequila bar. Do try the grilled corn on the cob.

Excellent place to hang all night with friends - great drinks, great food, great prices.",1
"I went to the one in Mesa on Baseline. I loved the vibe, service, and decor. They have witty jokes on the walls and the whole place makes you feel like you are at a party on the beach. We ordered the carne asada burrito and the mushroom burger and the sweet potato fries. We got the dessert pear and blackberry lemonades. You get 1 free refill so we tried the blood orange and the guava flavors after. Everything tasted great. I would def go back and get the mushroom burger. The prices are super cheap and the portions are huge.",1
"Only 10 min away from walking distant.
This is really really really good, also really really really bad.

I am almost finished with trying each soynami.... So far and not a fan of the one with banana.
YET EVERYTHING is.... just... just good. Place on top of a Swiss Alp let me sing, dance, and exclaiming goodness oozing. 

Also i can eat one and not feel lik I am creating havoc for my metabolism to compensate.

RL:

NOTE: Oddly takes an unusually amount of time to get into my hands. 10min?
Worth the wait, worth the walk, worth the extra chocolate ;)",1
"This is a cool dive away from all the Old Town BS. The jukebox is one of the best I have heard in some time. They were playing songs I never heard of so I know I'm going to be in trouble in the future by using Shazam to identify songs and then buying them from my phone!
Anyway, just be sure you eat before you get there as this is all about hanging in a dive and having drinks. They have lots of beer and the bartenders are cool. If I lived closer I would hang out here much more......",1
"Joe's Farm Grill features everything that is All-American. Burgers, pizzas, salads, hot dogs, and a variety of other classics, each with their own twist. I was pleasantly surprised that Sonoran Dogs were on the menu (I rarely see them outside of Tucson). I got a burger that was gigantic and yummy--don't forget to ask for grilled onions. There are a number of novelties in each of Joe's restaurants, but my favorite part about this one is that it is nestled right next to farmland. The ingredients here touted to be fresh and local, and I could definitely taste the difference in my burger and especially in the fruit cup.

I took my brother here for his birthday; he got a 4B and looved it. He wasn't able to complete the trifecta but there will always be next year!",1
"A timeless classic a place with more shows than I can / care to remember.

Seen a lot of up and coming people here as well as some pretty good regular nights as well.
Always an interesting collection of different music styles mixed in with a ton of talents of all sorta both local and elsewhere.

Cheap drinks and plenty of pool tables.
Old school video games and of course darts
Pizza and bar food that is actually decent!",0
"I've been taking mine and my family's cars to Cathedral for more than a decade. We are always treated fairly, and always have a good experience - the guys always stand by their work and ""go the extra mile"" to be sure our cars are fixed properly. They work on both our new(er) cars and my cars from the 50s and 60s. 

Whenever anyone is looking for a mechanic, I will send them here without fail - and John and the guys at Cathedral have always come through by totally taking care of anyone I send to them. In a business filled with some sketchy practices, I know that whether I send my wife, a friend, or a coworker to Cathedral they will be treated honestly and fairly. Cars break and break down, that's a fact of owning one. I'm glad I have Cathedral to make dealing with it so easy and stress free so I can get back on the road as quickly and cheaply as possible.",1
"A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa. 

They have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00. It was a bit ''watery'' for my taste but on a hot afternoon, it hit the spot. 

Wish they had sugar water to flavor it but didn't see it available.",1
"NEEDS A CUSTOMER FACING DISPLAY FOR THEIR POINT OF SALE SYSTEM. The staff here is WONDERFUL, and the OWNER IS ALWAYS HERE, yes that's right, if you come here often, you have the pleasure of meeting Lenny himself.

But one major flaw is that they need a display on their point of sale system showing you what you have ordered before you pay (just like their Glendale location), because I have had my order messed up more than quite a few times here, usually they forget my extra french fries, or place everything in the world on my cheese burger, when I only wanted the cheese, meat, and bun.

Other than that, I don't really have anything negative to say about this place. I love the staff, and if the right person is at the register, they remember my order and the negative points I have made above is negated.",1
"Roads are good
Service not so good

This place is a tourist trap in every sense of the word. The restaurant and gift shop are overpriced for what you get and the ice cream isn't anything special. Service from the staff needs to be a lot better and treat the customers like you want them there. Always understaffed always waiting on food. Been there a half dozen time no improvement.

Do come to the area for the beautiful views, not for the food or souvenirs. Great road for motorcycles ride.

During the summer outdoor cooking.",0
"Hit or miss. Pretty much the perfect definition of the ""HoHo"". 

My friend and I like to come before shows and for happy hour (super cheap draft beers and wells), the well drinks are usually a little weak but being so cheap I can't blame them.

Tuesday's are taco day and they have some pretty decent deals. Each day of the week has a ""special"" as far as food goes, it's average to below average bar food.

There are some games and shuffleboard as mentioned in previous reviews. TVs scattered all along the sitting area and a sizeable patio for the smokers.

The bartenders are the real hit or miss part of the experience. I've been here and had great service, I've returned to have sub-par service (it wasn't very busy).

All in all, if you're looking for a place to grab some cheap beers (we're talking domestics on tap) before heading into The Clubhouse or heading to somewhere else to spend the night, stop in and check it out at least once.",0
"After hitting up the bank to sign some paper work, I wanted to stop by the Biltmore for a quick lunch and had Paradise Bakery in mind.  As I was making my way through, I encountered a new facade with Southwestern designs that I have never seen before.  ""Cool!"" as I exclaimed to myself. 

It looked intriguing enough that I went in to ask the hostess for a menu.  After gazing around for a few minutes, the Chimichanga Entrée caught my attention! Content I was! j'adore Chimis!

After being seated in the, rather blandish, outdoor patio area with mistifiers cooling away, I put in my order: a Chimi and an Arnold Palmer.

Not too long, my waitress brought out some cool, fresh salsa and chips.  Nothing too dazzling, quite ordinary.  Chips were crispy, oily, and a tad salty.  Arnold palmer seemed to lack both the sweetness and citrus.

Now come the Chimi with a side of rice and beans.  Typical Mexican, you would think right? Well, up until I took my first bite into the rice! Puzzled face I was--like an Anime character.  I steadily kept taking small bites after small bites, analyzing what in the heck I was eating.  Generally, it was just sweet and overpowering what I would think a Mexican rice should be.  The corn bits probably only enhanced the sweetness further! The waitress confirmed honey was used but I initially guessed coconut!

The beans with pieces of bacon was just simple and watery.  At first, it seemed to have that smoky, cowboy-ish hint to it, but fell short of a decent side.

The Chimi was quite underwhelming in its overall taste.  What blanketed this deep-fried burrito were green chili (tasteless for the most part), drizzle of this sweet white cream (unsure of what), and some white cheese (unsure).  The tortilla shell was crisped enough and the chicken shred lacked the savoriness that I would have expected from a true Mexican joint.

Nothing made sense to me! Where was the Mexican? I tried very hard to find the positive in my meal.  I quit half way to be honest.  I hate to mention this, but I did garbled some of what I chewed back out to my plate.  Overall, it missed the savoriness that would have saved the meal.  I desperately wanted Tabasco sauce like it was the end of the world, but unfortunately it was too late.

I explained my calm, analytical dining experience to my waitress and she was very understanding and was fine with removing the item from the bill.  5-stars for that.

I really am unsure of returning as first impression is a pretty big deal to me.  The happy hour menu did not look that appealing either.

I guess the question is, how much can you expect out of Mexican-esque establishment that sits on a Fashion Park?  Heed, heed, heed this review.",0
"I was only able to play the front 9; my wrist was hurting too much to finish, which is a big deal because I live in IL, and was returning from LA and stopped here specifically to play the TPC. Oh well.

I was a single, and got paired with another. The course was pretty open, but we took our time and enjoyed the round. The front nine, although rarely shown on TV, is quite nice. Definitely challenging enough, and I didn't even play the back tees.

It was fairly easy to get on, the bar had pretty good food for a clubhouse, and the staff were very helpful. Definitely recommend the TPC.",1
"Last night after developing a huge craving for Panang Chicken and browsing Yelp for a good place nearby, I decided to call Papaya. The guy who answered the phone said that due to a downed gas line in the area they couldn't operate, but their Mesa store would deliver to me for no extra charge since I couldn't come pick it up like I wanted to. I said this would be fine, placed my order, and the guy said it would be about 45 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes later the food still hadn't arrived, but I figured it was just because it was coming from Mesa. 

When it finally arrived, I was starving, so I opened the food immediately, only to find out that my Panang CHICKEN was nothing but sauce and a few carrots and bell peppers. On top of this, I had been charged a delivery fee when they said I wouldn't, and I was charged for chicken when I got none. I called back immediately to tell them my food did not have any chicken in it, but was only sauce and a couple vegetables. They informed me that they were very busy and would not be able to bring me another order that night, but I could call back the next day (today) and they would bring me another order. I was upset and hoped that for all the trouble the food was at least good. Well, it was. The panang sauce was very delicious and perfectly spicy. Although it was not made the way I ordered it, I could still tell that it was very good and I would definitely order it again. 

Today, I called back and they brought me a new order, this time of Spicy Eggplant with chicken since I had already had to eat the panang I ended up with last night and didn't want that again at this point. They were very nice about making it right, and they delivered it to me again at no charge and credited back the charge they made last night. Delivery took about an hour and 15 minutes again even though he had said 45 and this location is about a mile from where I live, so if you order delivery expect a bit of a wait. As for the Spicy Eggplant with chicken, it was REALLY delicious. The eggplant tasted like some of the best I've ever had, not mushy but not firm, and I finally got my chicken and yes, it was very good. SO in conclusion, the food is great but I hope that they are more organized when they aren't having technical difficulties. Probably won't have them deliver again but I would definitely order from here again. If there hadn't been all the problems I would give them 4 stars but the fact that I couldn't even get my order corrected that night was upsetting.",0
"I have not liked one bar at all in Scottsdale, AZ. This was the first one! A semblance of a normal crowd. We ended up talking with some weirdo local chick, thought they were trying to do some kind of bizarre swinger plot, and they kicked rocks. Some friendly people in there though, all enjoying a good time singing and dancing. Maybe it was because I was inebriated, but the Karaoke was outstanding. These two chicks really belted it out last night. I had a really good time drinking here with my friend. They sell Heineken 22 oz bottles here. I thought that was pretty cool. My friend said ""Headband is the best"" about this place, I have no idea what the means though.",1
"Just isn't very good.

I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.

I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.

We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.

The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.

Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty. 

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.",0
"What can I say except that Jodi is incredible. I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half. I sent her a message and she quickly responded. Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me. You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate. I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies. That day I saw Erica. She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair. For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you. It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable. It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots. Note: wear loose fitting clothing, nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body. Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot. Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary, I made sure to use a primer. I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set. Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do. Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease. I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me. It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well. The overall whole experience was incredible. I felt sexy and confident. I went back with my honey to look at the photos. He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album. I can't wait to see everything finished. I can't wait to do it again :) Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience. I highly recommend her and her ladies!!!",1
"You don't come for the run-of-the-mill pizza. Nor do you show up for the cheap pitchers of beer. No, you make it here for the show. A massive organ fills the entire building, incorporating dozens of intruments, and the virtuosos playing it take center stage. Sit back and watch then perform your favorite songs, from Star Wars to The Little Mermaid. Don't let the average food dissuade you from a one-of-a-kind experience.",1
"Staying here in lieu of getting a real apartment.  

Pros:
There is someone making my bed.
Location.
Eye candy (they got something right).  Girls are smokin. 
Valet.
  
Cons:
I have a rental car but for nights out, where are the taxis?  You would think paying $250/night 5 nights a week, you would think they'd call one for me.  When I called front desk, they told I can catch one downstairs.  No, I do not want to stand out front in the cold and wait fot the parking attendant to holla one for me.  
Very small rooms - No couch or real sitting area.
And what?!  No tubs except for the suites. 
No jacuzzi?
Gym - is that treadmill falling apart?  No, it's just someone using it.
Bliss lotion (smells great but useless) - all this dry weather, I have to BYOL.  
Room service (food and wine by the glass)...more variety please.",0
"you want a hotel, what really matters?

Cleanliness!!!  5 stars.
Friendly staff.
And they got the really good cylindrical candies... mmmmm.  

ok, now that we got that out of the way.... some funky odors in one of the hallways and elevator at one end of the hall was out of order our entire stay.

i would come back though.  solid price performer.",0
"I'm not sure why it has taken me so long to actually go inside Go-Kat-Go, but I finally did and loved it!  This store is filled with all sorts of great retro Hawaiian treasures along with a plethora of other gems.  We've got locally designed clothing in one corner, awesome furniture in another, tons of handmade accessories in the middle and bunches of fun throughout!  It was really hard not to pick up everything in this store and buy it.  The owner was really nice and offered to hold our stuff while we shopped.  I ended up walking out of there with an awesome Dia de los Muertos pillow that looks amazing on my new couch plus a matching potholder/oven mitt set in a really cool pattern.  I will definitely be back, especially since my other mom's b-day is coming up and she loves this kind of stuff.",1
"Really good barbeque and steaks in an old school setting decorated with baseball memorabilia. The service was tight also which is always a big plus. The food is definitely artery clogging, so i'd reccomend it only once-in-awhile. 

They have some great price points in here modest wine list. Oaky cabernet sauvignon for beef and go for a zinfandel for the barbeque. For the prices, you can't go wrong!",1
I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasn't that great! I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry!  There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening! I will not be going back!,0
"I ADORE this place. Matt's has been a staple breakfast, brunch, whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago. They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isn't so crammed! Not that we all didn't enjoy their original house, this one just says, ""I'm still awesome, I just stepped up a notch."" Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon.",1
A little pricey for the portions but the flavors are outstanding. Homemade horchata is like my nana used to make.,1
"This is one of Scottsdale's new hot spots. If you like the 'Scottsdale' scene, this place is a must. Sunday the music goes off as Thomas James spins sic house beats and the bar serves up $2 tacos. On the weekends, it is still the hot new local spot so it is always busy. Fun place to go and usually there is great eye candy.",1
"At least one a week. Can't go wrong.

"went for an early dinner with my honey on saturday.  we normally don't order apps but we we didn't have lunch so we needed something to get us through. we went with the hummus and pita bread and it was so fresh and yummy! server said that it's homemade in house. For my entree I ordered the salmon with mixed veggies and the hubster ordered the crispy chicken and subbed the creamed corn with mashed potatoes, he loved his side of asparagus... smokey flavor.  our server did provide us a lit sample of the creamed corn because he raved how delicious it is. yes the creamed corn was very rich and in my opinion not worth the calories unless you've been good all day.  we both ordered red cabs and we skipped dessert since we were nice and full. enjoyed our meals and the friendly service.",1
"I totally agree with L.C.'s review.  Going to XCP made college seem like a breeze.  Yes, there were the typical high school dramatics, but I feel like the teachers were able to take a harder line on discipline, since they weren't in fear of getting in hot water with the public school district.  I had an overall great experience here, and I love meeting people all over the country that have gone to Xavier.  My last flight home, the person in the seat next to me went there, and we had tons of people/things to chat about.  It's fun to see where everyone has ended up, and it is fun to get together with fellow alums for drinks here in Chicago, and when I am back home in AZ.  I think it is so sad that the girls don't get to do freshman swimming, sophomore dances, or go to dockers anymore - those were some defining moments of my XCP career.  I don't know much about other private schools cropping up in the growing valley, but if I had kids, they would be headed to Xavier and Brophy!",1
"My first experience with PCG was at a small, yet fantastic Yelp event.  I've been back twice and have been just as impressed.

The first time was for brunch, and I recommend the griddled corn cakes.  No, I just don't recommend them, I insist you have them.  Even if you are allergic to corn, take the plunge and try these...unless you might die, then stay away as that might be bad PR for PCG.  Topped with smoked ham (that's what I had), chicken, or bacon and served with maple syrup, it was beyond good.  I could eat this dish every day of my life.  The black beans were okay, but I do think the breakfast potatoes are nothing special and could be improved upon.  I was a big fan of a $4 mimosa, however!  Yep, you read that right...4 bucks!

Second visit for dinner, and I ordered the cedar planked salmon.  A generous piece of fish perfectly cooked and served with a delicious lemon aioli.  The accompanying roasted beets were not my thing, and the mashed potatoes were okay (maybe I'm picky about potatoes?)  I also tried a bit of my dining companion's beef tenderloin and it was butter-knife tender (that's what I cut it with).  Served with a stuffed potato and mushrooms, I believe, it will most likely be my next entree.  For dessert, we shared the Jack Daniel's croissant bread pudding.  We actually shared half, and I most generously took the other half to my husband who I left at home.  Although, I generally don't care for bread pudding, this is NOT your typical bread pudding and probably the best bread pudding you can imagine (other than that one recipe that uses a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts).

Although PCG is a little bit of a drive for me (outside my usual 5-mile maximum radius), I will happily make that drive and return again.",1
We love Dr Steve!,1
"Everyone here is very helpful and friendly.  No matter who I come in contact with I can tell they love animals and care about me and my pet.  The vet calls me himself to discuss my cat's test results.  They also made sure to give me a lot of information regarding the medications they are putting her on.  I feel that my family gets good care from this vet.  We ended up moving about 15 minutes away, but still make the trip to see this vet.",1
"I don't have much to compare it to, since this is the only Venezulan restaurant I know of in AZ.  It's very small, definitely family-run, with what looks to be the adolescent son taking orders and bringing out drinks.  The young man who seems to be the owner shares the space with Rosati's.  

My foodie group saw a write-up of this place in the newspaper so we decided to trek out to Mesa.  It was pretty darn good, especially for the price!

They were out of Guayanes (the newspaper had recommended this arepa) so we ordered three other arepas.  In case you don't know, an arepa is a corn fritter type sandwich.  We had the queso de ano, which appeared to have a salty cheese and potato in it.  It was very yum.  We had reina pepiada arepa, which was  like a mayonaise-y chicken salad with avocado- we didn't care that much for it.  But the Pabellon arepa with fried plantain, shredded beef, and black beans was a hit.

We also had the pabellon plate which was quite yummy with the best fried plantains I've ever had.  Oddly, the rice was a bit hard and dry. The cachapas jamon and queso de mano was a favorite with my fellow foodies- kind of like a pancake sandwich with ham and cheese.  We finished with the quesillo (tastes exactly like flan to me) which was very good.

I'd say it's a bit of a drive for some of us, but it's definitely worth checking out.  Not for those looking for heart-healthy eats!",1
"And then it all changed...

I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time. 

So, where do I start. After feeling dog sick for a few days, I finally decided to ""walk-in"" to this place because that's what they do now supposedly. They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP. I signed in at 8:20 and was not called in the back until 10:00am. Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me. By the time everything was over, it was 11:00am before I walked out of this place. 

I asked to talk to Brenda, the office manager and was brushed off twice. Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours! I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point. What could she have said really? 

The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in. When I pointed that out, she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart. Instead of apologizing, she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake. 

When the NP did come see me, she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about. I was quite appalled. I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart. 

My final analysis: In my opinion, don't go here if your health and time are valuable to you.",0
"Happy Hour Review.

We stopped by to try the much ballyhooed Happy Hour and were were pretty damn underwhelmed.    First of all, I guess I'm failing to see what's so happy about a $6.00 spicy tuna roll and $8.00 drink.  Secondly, like other non-japanese sushi joints in this town (cough, cough Ra Sushi), this is sushi for people who don't really like sushi.  Thirdly, seriously attitudinous staff, but one look at the uber-douchy clientele explains that.  Pass.",0
"Carmel Bianca!!! Oh my Effin Gosh... that's the stuff! It's yum. I'm a fan of white chocolate flavored coffee so maybe I'm bias and why I simply enjoyed my 16oz of Carmel Bianca goodness. It's simply espresso, steamed milk, white chocolate and carmel drizzled on top. And that's the signature drink of Dolce Espresso.

Thanks to Yelp I decided last night after a driving lesson with L that I was too tired to drive home without something to pick me up... and that was reason enough to make the short trek to Dolce because I've always wanted to try it. Wasn't exactly sure where it was, and happy to find that it's just across from Padre's next to a Psychic place. Dolce has a cool vibe with music videos playing. And they're good songs too... like I had never seen Pitbull's ""The Anthem"" video... liked it! Enjoyed my Carmel Bianca with a slice of their Chicago Style Cheesecake. I liked the cheesecake because it was different in taste compared to other cheesecakes, it was like a marzipan with cheese frosting on top... so it was interesting. Not really a fan of the German Choc that my friends K and D got. I thought it was dry... yuck! 

It's a small place that's bright, with four flat screens spread about. The owner, Cesar (I think) was a sweetheart! I just hope Dolce survives as a 24 hour cafe on weekends because this place has potential. It's way better than counterculture cafe back in the day. This is like the best place to go after the bars if you need a pick me up before heading home to the eastside from central Phoenix. Prices are moderate. SO pls check this place out and spread the word... love it and I'll be back!",1
"This place is wonderful! The service is amazing and food is delicious. 

I especially enjoyed the Clams Oreganato appetizer.  

The Eggplant Parm lunch special came with pasta and choice of soup or salad.  What a great deal!",1
"I'm on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day. We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling. 

Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces. 

There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors. 

The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there.

It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them",1
"Narcisse couldn't be more appropriately named...another Scottsdale scene club with a lively but predictable crowd of scantily dressed cougars, Middle Eastern royalty and upscale business folk. The music is hoppin and thumpin late and leans toward House, which is why I added two stars. We actually entered by taking an elevator up and walking through a kitchen in rather cinematic style, emerging right onto the dance floor, which was packed. I guess it pays to know someone. The champagne selection is outrageous here and packed though it was, our drinks arrived in seconds. The sky-high patio is a nice place to chill and check out the little skyline, but it's all about getting your dance on here. I would like to check it out for happy hour when fewer people are bumping into you and stepping on your feet. The Russian mobster-channeling bouncers are a little intimidating, but treated us well. An uber enthusiastic dancer knocked into my friend and shattered her Veuve glass, and all was whisked and mopped in seconds. The music sure beats the tired 90s cover bands that seem to be epidemic in this area.",0
"I am being generous with my review. I am biased since this place has been one of my favorite restaurants for years. I love it in Georgia and this place continues the tradition of rocking faces off - Italian style. 

I went to this locale for my birthday party with about 20 friends (unbelievable, I know). This place was more than accommodating. The waitress was fantastic, even though we were a pain in the butt come check time. I took her suggestions for our family style dinner and not one disappointed. I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto. Both were fantastic entrees. To top it off, we finished out with killer tiramisu. 

There is nothing bad I can say for this place. The atmosphere is what you would  expect from a large italian restaurant. I personally love that their waiting area is also the bar. That is just good thinking. It truly is a killer place that is perfectly nestled in north Scottsdale. I am in love...",1
"Excellent everything! The customer service was struggling a bit but well, they just opened so hopefully that'll improve. 

The cookies are great. The grilled cheese was so so. Took awhile to get to us but it was slammed (but also, I was on a time limit).

The manager came over and offered us free dessert for our not 100% experience. She also shared with us what soups were vegetarian and were not.

I'm excited to go back. It's a great option for Downtown Phoenix!",1
"I can't remember the name of the special salad we had tonight with Shrimp, but I will never forget the taste.  FABULOUS is an understatement!  The NY pizza was equally as great.  Every time I come here I say to myself, we need to come more often.  Everything is always good.

Diane was our server tonight.  What a cutie!  More important is that the service was excellent!  Diane was back at our table many times checking to see if there was anything else she could do for us.  Another comment I want to make is there was a young man taking care of the table.  At some point I thanked him and was surprised to receive ""Your more than welcome"", instead of the typical ""No Problem"" statement coming from young people.  I should have gone to the management to tell them I was impressed by him, his smile and mannerisms.

We will be back!",1
"Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.

It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received. 

I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant. 

It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should. 

Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.

We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point. 

To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.

Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it.",0
"My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.

I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.

Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.

This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag. The sad part is that the interior is very well done, if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting.",0
"Huge fan of this bistro. Everyday or two there is a new exotic meat that you must try.

The staff is super awesome and Brant is my go to guy.

I highly recommend sangria sundays, the wagyu and veggie burger are my absolute favorites. Not to mention, the sweet potato fries and Purple Haze beer. 

If you like sliders, this is the best place to go in scottsdale.",1
"Good Whole Foods location overall... The workers are very nice and attentive, and the food selection is good! Not the biggest Whole Foods I've ever been to, though.",1
"Sakana is one of my two favorite neighborhood sushi joints. I love their calamari salad (although the one at this location is considerably smaller than the one on 59th ave) and agedashi tofu. The waitstaff is friendly and their bday song is always fun! 

Insider's tip: ask for some real wasabi!",1
"I have been searching for a good Pho restaurant ever since Saigon Pho in Chandler went down hill.  Pho Van is a very clean, well organized, and well staffed restaurant in the Asian Center that shares space with Lee Lee's and other shops.  

I had the traditional Pho Ga (chicken soup in beef broth) and Goi Cuon (Spring rolls).  Both were very good.  The noodles in the broth were perfectly cooked and had great texture and the chicken was all white meat and very tender.  The veggies that accompany the pho were fresh and crisp.  The Spring Rolls were perfect as well stuff full of healthy green veggies.  

The prices were a little higher than I am used to in a pho place but it was not bad.  They also do not accept AMEX so beware if that is all you use.  

Overall a great place and this is my new Go-To-Pho in the valley.",1
"This is a great place to have a casual meal.  It's obviously a pub atmosphere but it's large enough to accommodate a lot of people without it getting crowded.  They also have many well placed flat screen tvs. (I just wish they would turn on the closed captioning!  Its one thing if you're watching a sporting event but when they have on an analysis show I want to hear the analysis!)   My husband had the beer sampler and enjoyed most of the varieties, the Raj IPA was his favorite (the 8th Street Ale and Kiltlifter are the more popular ones).  We had the soft pretzel appetizer which was ok, but I'm spoiled when it comes to pretzels having lived in Philly and lived on them for my entire college career.   I wish it came with a honey mustard to dip in and not just regular spicy mustard.  I had the French Dip which was solid - not the best I've had but still pretty good.  My husband had the Tap Room Tenderloin sandwich that he enjoyed - the onion straws and bleu cheese were a nice touch.

Now this is just stupid.  (Saturday, 4/13)

"SIMPLY AMAZING!  WE LOVE IT!

My hubby and I stopped in one day after deciding NOT to go to NYPD. 
They were next door, and we thought lets try something new. We have been there 3 times since. You sit, and the food comes by and you just grab what you want off the rotating bar. ITS GREAT! Especially if you can not decide what you want until seeing it. We ate like King and Queen for $20.00.

They have simple pricing, and it is affordable for a date or family.",1
"""Gosh-Awful-Gooey Banana Split: fresh banana split lengthwise, Turkish coffee ice cream blanketed with caramel sauce, red raspberry sorbet smothered in marshmallow sauce with delicious whip and a juicy maraschino cherry atop."" Heaven!!",1
"My husband and I eat out a lot and we had the best dining experience ever the other night! We sat at the bar with the bartender AJ and he was such a delight! We had happy hour which was probably the best deal in town! 5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers!?! My favorite was the steamed mussels. We loved it so much we also had dinner. The classic pasta deal was the best. Getting to take one home gives you at least two more meals, the next day. It's hard in this economy to get more bang for your buck but Maggianos they are doing it right! We will defiantly be back for more!",1
"Simply the best automotive repair place I've yet found in Phoenix. Honest, fair, and competent. I've taken three vehicles there for service over several years now and never been dissatisfied.",1
I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.,1
"one of the best chinese food here in phoenix. you have to tell them to use less salt. because often times, the food just a bit too salty. other than that. it has great selection for Szechwan style food.",1
"Ok first off, with the demise of Soma and the fact that Green is in Tempe.....this place is a welcome sight, and I know I'll be back. The food is excellent. However I feel that Dr Weil has has has the wool pulled over his eyes by Mr. Fox. Come one ""Anazazi Beans"" and a drink called the ""Medicine Man""? Really- as an American Indian rights advocate you'd think we'd be past this. Actually, you'd think educated white men with lots of money would be past this --but ya know. Just because Anazazi really refers to Ancestral Pueblo people who lived mainly in NM and N. AZ and means ""ancient enemy"" in Navajo so that term isn't used by nearly ANYONE anymore...means that you probaby shouldn't call your dish by that name. Other than that- I give em props for trying.

I recently had another experience there where EVERYTHING was going wrong that night, and the staff recovered....kinda. My advice, shape up if ya wanna last.",0
"Yes, the place is busy every time I go there, and it takes 20 minutes or so to get your order
Yes, the inside is cheesy and cheap with folding tables and could definitely use a makeover
Yes, the location is...ummm...well lets just say its a ""working class neighborhood""

BUT they've got the best fish tacos I've ever had, and everything on their Mexico City street food style menu is outstanding. The $1 tacos are ""mini-tacos"" so get 3 or 4 of them, a couple of fish tacos, maybe a side of rice and/or beans and you will be all set.

Go there. Just leave yourself plenty of time, it's well worth the wait.",1
"Jerry's...  Ugh!  I try to like you since we live so close to each other but...  Ugh!
I have had numerous irritating experiences at Jerry's.  In a nutshell...
I use red Prismacolor pencils.  I run out and go to Jerry's, they don't have them, don't know if they carry them and and nobody can tell me when and if they might reappear.  Why?  The (seemingly) canned answer is because the order comes from corporate, in North Carolina or somewhere far, far away where there is no phone or email access.  I go to buy Sculpey... OUT!  Same answer as to when it might return.  I need Faber Castell PITT brush tip markers...  OUT!  The same story with some airbrush materials. 
""Come back Tuesday or Thursday or just give us a call and we'll check if it's in...""   
I can walk to Jerry's in less than 10 mins but I would rather go to AZ Art or anywhere else than have to call everytime I need some stuff.  I can go to AZ Art in Tempe and when something is out can order from their mother store and it's there the next day.  

The clerks I have dealt with there are part of my rant.  Of the handful that I have dealt with, (mostly morning and daytime) it seems like they don't really know the store well or give a crap to give some insight on their products or company.
They do have a big store and I understand that there is alot of inventory to know about and be able to locate but that is your job.  It just seems like nobody that I have dealt with there is really keyed in on knowing their stuff.
I spoke to a gal there who was really chatting me up on her recent art night where she painted this huge piece and blah blah blah but when I asked if she knew when they might have more of the brush tip markers she was mum.   ""No clue."" 
Jerry's, just clean it up and have your people act toward you and your customers with the same passion they have with their own art.  Do this and I will try to like you again.",0
"I visited on high reviews.  I think it's a little over-rated, but good none the less.  My burger was a bit overcooked, food was overpriced but the service was top notch.  Great service, exciting atmosphere (although a bit cramped).  I would go again with hopes of a better burger.",0
"The Orange is a popular, well-reputed joint in my neighborhood. The Pizzaria is connected to a small bakery and deli. IMO, it's overpriced and over-rated. The parking is usually impossible and often dangerously full of gargantuan SUVs and expensive sports cars. 

There is valet parking available at times that is also overpriced, pretentious, and unnecessary. The parking lot is tiny and I need a valet to park my car? What a racket. Overflow parking is available on street in the bicycle lane (thanks a lot folks!)

I used to have coffee here in the mornings week-ends in the outdoor cafe', but the place has become a neighborhood nusiance. The orange caters to a clientele that largely appears to regard itself as quite UMC. Probably they should be located in Paradise Valley instead of eastern Phoenix.

I give it three stars because the food is good. That can't be disputed. The facilities and the company leave much to be desired though. If your idea of an enjoyable experience includes good food surrounded by SUV-driving soccer moms with ears adhered to cell phones, this place might just be for you.",0
"My hard drive crashed on my computer and Apple told me that they recommend a 3rd party company to retrieve my data. Like most Americans I am totally Apple Brainwashed so I did what they said. This company came back and told me that it would cost between $1800 & $2400 to retrieve my data. I asked for them not to precede and got my computer back. I walked into this location, told them my problem and $199 later got all my data put on to my external hard drive. I am very thankful for them and would recommend them to anyone in need!",1
"2.5 stars really. I've been holding off on the review because I stunned myself by paying $6.50 for a macaroon. Really? I did that! Ugh. It was tasty but $6.50!?! 

And, that's not even counting my breakfast: $9 for a wedge of quiche and a salad (that I didn't want - I just wanted a piece of quiche). 

I don't mind paying for good food (anyone who knows me knows food is pretty much WHAT I spend my money on... ) but I'm having huge buyer's remorse... over my meal! Something's not right with that.",0
"I love this place, that is, the selection and randomness of the food. However, the prices I'm not so keen on.

My sugar snap peas were the same as Safeway and were fresh, so I'm sold on that.

It's also the only place I can find my Kettle brand chips in the flavor I crave, so I'm sold on that too.

Now if only the prices could reach my income level, that'd be stellar.",1
"I know everyone has raved about this place. So naturally, I was was super excited to try it. I don't know if it was just so hyped up or what, but it just seemed like a normal pizza to me... with a really long wait.

I was meeting some girlfriends there for lunch, we got there a few minutes early and asked to be seated, but they won't seat you until the whole party is there, unfortunately (although understandable!). So we stood outside, in the 108 degree heat until everyone got there. After waiting over an hour, they finally were able to seat us. We had three kiddos with us, and they told us they only had two high chairs. (Not a huge issue, but definitely not convenient either.)

I thought their menu was extremely limited, only have 6 pizzas: 3 with red sauce and 3 with white sauce and then just a few toppings you could add.

While the food was alright, I didn't find it over-the-top or spectacular as I had expected. Needless to say, I'd have no problem going back but I probably wouldn't seek it out.",0
"I met up with a girlfriend at borders. This Border's is across from the Scottsdale fashion square. The store is inviting, clean, bright, and new. They have a variety of books, and good sales.
Upstairs is the Seattle's best coffee cafe. I had a coupon for a free medium drink when you buy a bag of coffee beans. I was surprised how good my cafe mocha was, better than Starbucks.
note: If you have little kids, they do have story time on Mondays at 10:00 AM. Every Friday is Bean Friday in Seattle's Best Coffee cafe. Buy a bag of beans and receive a FREE medium beverage.",1
"This was the first Mexican restaurant my boyfriend and I had eaten at when we moved to Arizona. We had good hopes since we were in the West now. Not the case- there is a few good and a few bad:

GOOD: It is a great location, in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Walking distance from our house !! The patio is the reason we selected this place; not too loud, secluded and enough space between tables  .
 The food is also pretty good. Chips are awesome and so is the salsa ( I always judge the Mexican restaurants I go to by their salsa )

BAD: the first time we went the service was just okay. But we just figured it was because we came on a Friday during lunch. But we have gone back to this place 3 other times and the service keeps getting worse and worse . I asked for water 3 times and never got it. My chips are never refiled and it takes FOREVER to get a beer and the bar is right there. I think I watched my beer sit at the bar counter for 20 mins. and of course it was warm when i go it since it was just sitting in the sun. I should have gotten it myself. 

We will probably drive a little farther to get better service.",0
"Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different. 

I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.

Service=slow.
Food=just tastes like salt
Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.

Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs.",0
"This place is great. The food is Northern Chinese similar to Chinese Muslim food. They have a great variety for reasonable prices. Also, everything is freshly prepared and you can even see them make the dumplings and pork pie behind a glass window.
We got the stir fry spinach (bok choy) with garlic, sesame bread, pork and napa cabbage dumplings, pork pie and green onion pancakes. I know its a lot of food but we wanted to try a good variety and it cost about $27. Not to shabby! the spinach and garlic was really fresh and flavorful. The bread was decent, almost like a dense curried bread. The pork dumplings were similar to soup dumplings, one of my most favorite dumplings ever. The pork pie was almost like a pork patty covered in dumpling dough and pan-fried. It was crunchy, moist, juicy and delicious all at the same time. We were getting full so we ended up only eating half of the green onion pancakes which were well prepared. We will definitely be making another trip back here soon.

Side note: They sell bags of frozen/take-home dumplings. About $10 for a bag of 40.",1
I stayed at the hotel and I tried Tuscany and it was really good.  Delicious Scallops and pasta.  Also the pizza was excellent.  The server was great and I would return to this restaurant when I visit the hotel again.,1
Their Bruschetta selection was absolutely amazing.,1

Way to keep it classy over there.....",0
"Great food their pork is awesome !!!!  The slow cooking made this dish superb.   Of course the margaritas are as good as they get!

"what can I say - we're CF regulars...just love the place. I guess we are lucky because we have never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes for 3 of us.  We eat here at least twice a month and we always start with the avocado egg rolls - they are to die for and the dipping sauce is yummy!  I usually get a Glam burger - the only time I eat red meat -  and so far have not had one I did not like. I  often take 1/2 home so I can save room for some cheesecake, an absolute must when at CF. We have never had a bad cheesecake and try a different one each time. This is the only hamburger that I have liked the next day - usually hamburger is the one food that is not a good take home food as it just does not taste good as a left over - but I have actually eaten it cold because I took a bite before heating it and just kept going...yes, weird I know.

If nothing else, go there for some avocado egg rolls and then treat yourself to a cheesecake....I'm totally addicted! Absolute divine decadence! ;D",1
"Easily the worst ""burrito"" I have ever had.
It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better.",0
"I recall my first visit to Carolina's...

The time? About 1 PM.

As my GPS says ""You have arrived at your destination,"" I frantically look. I see nothing that looks like a hole in the wall restaurant!

Well, I review the exact address, and note that the address (1202 Mohave Street) matches the ""ghetto"" building with all the nice cars parked afront.

""Well, that must be it!""

I park. Then I walk up to the door. The entrance reminded me of a homeless shelter or food bank.

As I entered, the restaurant was filled with people.

Since then, I have repeated visits to Carolina's with a few favorites...

- Chips and Salsa
- Shredded Beef Taco (Crispy)
- Cheese Quesadillas
- Cheese Enchiladas

The food is low-priced. For example, tacos are about $2 each. Burritos are about $4 each.

Additional Notes:

- Closes relatively early in the evening.
- Serves breakfast.",1
"I am changing my review - lately because of bad economy, they are not getting enough customers, their food quality has gone down. I won't waste my time or money on this.",0
"Came here with a bunch of the crew from work during lunch, and wow! This hidden gem on the corner of Indian School & 48th Street is a must visit if you're in the Arcadia area. The food here is amazing, and there's such a wide variety including delicious tater tots (even sweet potato tater tots) and the mouth watering reuben that I had chosen. You get a good sized portion as well. Thank goodness for take-home boxes! 

The restaurant is very spacious, and the staff is really friendly & laid back but get you seated and eating your food in no time. It gets better; the price of the food is VERY reasonable, in fact, I'm kind of shocked how inexpensive they are. A well deserved five stars!",1
"Y'know, rarely do I buy the ""extended warranty"" that most places try to peddle on you nowadays. If you buy the item from a reputable manufacturer, it should be unnecessary. 

In the case of tires, I have to make an exception. 

You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car, but not the quality of construction workers who don't know how to secure their nails, screws and bolts for travel on highways, streets and other local thoroughfares. They're a nefarious bunch for the most part. I'm not for extra taxes, but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway. 

For the second time in a year, one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw, mind you, but a BOLT.  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment, used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire, and called for a tow. 

The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC, but they're good here too), and worth every penny. The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice, and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment). There is even free water for customers. They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it, which is fine (as long as it holds). 

Every Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting, the quality of customer service, and the wait. In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction, I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires, no matter where you buy them. I prefer getting mine from DT.",1
Dr. Greg Allen is the best doctor in the East Valley and probably the state! He has the best of bed side manners and is caring in his listening to the patient's needs. We have used him for several years and trust him completely.,1
"I like to start out any restaurant reviews with I'm a vegetarian so my choice of food is limited. Please take that in to consideration.

I've been here once before and had breakfast, and it might have been one of the best breakfasts in the world. I would have given it 5 stars if I wrote my review that day. 

I went yesterday for a sandwich and salad and thought it was so so at best. I was a little bummed about the instruction, or lack of instruction from the staff on how to order. It appears, and I didn't know this while ordering, that you can pick what ingredients you want to add or delete from certain sandwiches or salads. I got what I got, and it didn't exactly include what I like, or what I didn't. 

Today I would give it three stars, but since I liked the breakfast so much, I'll mix the review to give it 4 stars. Only fair. 

I'll go back and give it a try again sometime. I'm in no rush to get there, but I wouldn't avoid the place either. For breakfast, if I do want some french toast, waffles, or pancakes I'll head down to give a second shot for sure!",1
"I enjoyed seeing the Cezanne collection. It's just like pictured in the book. I spent time reading about his works and his influence on composition and form. As in other museum I've visited, one really can't take pictures of their best display. It's really a place to walk around for a couple of hours when one doesn't feel rush.

I wanted to be surprise to see Classical sculptures and hand made works of art and I didn't see any here as,  I'm very particular about the historical eras and movement of interest . Leave that to the big city museums. The fact that they have high end borrowed art and a place like this in Phoenix makes it a must for resident to see once in a while what the civic offering provides. This place is half a block off the light rail makes it convenient.",0
"I have heard about this place for couple years before I actually get to try it out. Their guacamole burger is my favorite, and the Peanut Butter Malt was just amazing!! First time I tried, I ended up getting another one to go. They also have corn beef sandwich on Thursday, which I haven't get the chance to try yet. Only thing I dislike is that they close at 8 pm which is a bit too early for me.",1

"Amanda B organized a UYE for Dim Sum here today.  They do Dim Sum from a menu instead of carts and it works really well.  They also have a picture menu to look at with many of the items on it so folks like me can have a better idea what to order just by picking the picture of stuff they liked on a prior trip.  We were pretty much the only folks there for quite a while and we had the full attention of the staff.  Not all of the staff is fluent in English but I can only recall that being a problem with the tea.  I liked my choices a bit better this time, experience helps, and Marian H was helping me with sauce pairings as there were several to choose from.

I almost gave them a 4 but for the restroom.  The fixtures had a lot of corrosion around them and in general the restroom showed a lot of wear.  I flushed the urinal and was washing my hands and it seemed like the running water was very loud, I looked over at the urinal and the valve had stuck and the place was indeed flooded.  I beat on the valve with my fist until it rocked back but by that time the floor was quite deep in water.  I mentioned it to the hostess and they had someone in there with a mop quickly.

I would definitely go back here again.",0
"For a brewery type restaurant they do a pretty good job, in fact mabe the best one in town for me. Most of these type of places do a very mediocre jobs with a very extensive menu. 

BJ's has a great gluten free options. the pizza is very good, probably the best I've had in town. good selection of beers. service is always pretty good.",1
"Here's a thought, don't post on the door to your restaraunt ""Up scale Mexican Food"" unless you can prove it.  This was not upscale, it was barely pass-able  as decent.  Didn't help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong.  Will not return.",0
"This is the largest urban park. Moreover, that urban part is great because I am 10-30 minutes from three major trailhead areas. 

For hiking I like many points of entry, one of my favorites is telegraph pass, this is on the south side of the mountain. A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway. There is a paved path that is about 1/2 a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right.

Telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs. At the top, there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail. If you head west, you can reach a great Ramada.

From the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national, after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills, I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel, Follow this trail to reach fat man's pass, contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around, this meets back up with national trail. Many unique rock formations on this hike. 

For shorter easier hikes from this lot, you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop, and have a few nice views.

For Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic, with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines it's great for a novice rider.",1
"When cowboys ride off into the sunset, they probably stop at Greasewood Flat for a burger and beer. This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive! You'll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon. Say hello to the mule on your way in. Outside they have picnic tables, horseshoes, and fire pits (gets chilly out there in the desert!), and on the weekends they have live music and dancing. 

Inside, the bar is pretty small, and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals. For the nights without live music, don't you fret, they have a jukebox with tons of country hits. The night we went it was the bartender's birthday, and the regulars were definitely having a good time.  

Both a historic landmark (120+-year old original stagecoach stop) and a dive bar, Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona, and is a definite must see. I'll be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two..",1
"Great quality. Their Pad Thai with chicken is the best I've ever had. Fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Their Yupha's Fried Rice is delicious with the pineapple compliments. Their Red Curry gets a 2 star rating for just being Red Curry (it's not as creamy, fresh, or flavorful as Thai Basil on University). It's a neighborhood gem and I'm lucky enough to live right around the corner from Yupha's Thai Kitchen!

Also, it's clean, bright, and has an inviting ambiance. It's perfect for a sit in casual dining experience, and even nice for takeout. 

Staff is friendly and attentive. 

Come here. Seriously.",1

i often forget AZ is quite different than CA....

my first and only experience at cabela's was on black friday. i honestly havent participated in black friday much in past yrs and questioned deals really being deals. but HELLO deals at cabela's.

first of all, they gave away rifles to the first 800 people we were there on black friday. again, im not in cali anymore! this place is an outdoors lover dream. and on top of selection and discounted prices...its almost like an amusement park: 

aquarium room with freshwater fish, back natural history museum-eque taxidermy displays, heads of animals and maps of where they originate from hanging throughout the huge main room, a chocolate shop, and entire cafeteria. 

basically, you can make a day out of cabela's. we were there for 4 hours and i didn't even realize.

Great food and service! Country food at its best!,1
"When I think of Richardson's, I feel warm and cozy inside.  I've been on several occasions and I love the atmosphere... I always have a good time at this hidden little gem of the city.

The 'Cuisine of New Mexico' is unique... they are known for their green chile potato as well as several other pork dishes.  I usually go for the fish or seafood specials... they have a standard menu and then specials posted on chalk boards around the restaurant.

Most recently I enjoyed the blackened scallop appetizer as my entree along with a huge house salad.  The scallops were a little bit salty but cooked just right.  They were served on a tortilla with rice, beans, and a yummy spicy sauce.  Their salads are really tasty, and many of the entree specials come with a starter salad.  I went with a group of 4 and we had a couple of bottles of wine and a plain pizza as an appetizer to share.  Needless to say, none of us had room for dessert!

Be prepared for a crowd whenever you go, but enjoy your company and the people around you.  Call ahead and make a reservation if you can...  if you do have to wait, sit at the bar or by the fireplace; you can't complain once you have a drink in hand and the scent of the fire mixed with hot food and good energy.  I'll be back again soon, Richardson's!",1

"I have been dining at this Indian restaurant for a few years now.  It was introduced to me by a close friend.  I have taken my co-workers, members of my ward, my mother and brothers and finally I get a chance to review it online.

I don't mind going in for dinner, but the buffet is to die for.  Their consistency has never failed.  This place is great!",1
"Great beer, Good atmosphere, Non annoying music and great wait staff make this my favorite place to spend an evening.",1
When in the mood for bagels I go to Einstein's with my several year old yellow Einstein Brothers stainless coffee mug.  I pick up an AZ Republic and order a toasted good grains bagel with garden veggie.  I usually have the bagel in a basket by the time I get to check out or at worst when I am filling the coffee mug.  The coffee is mellower than my usual Starbucks but compliments the bagel.  Einstein's draws both the young and mature and I enjoy the ability to read the paper at my leisure either inside or outside in the morning shade.,0
"I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and I'm SO glad I did!  Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced!

My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced.

I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon!",1
"While I am giving this restaurant four stars, I must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre.  If you want spectacular pizza in Phoenix, don't kid yourself that it's at I-17 and Thomas.  It's over at Pizzeria Bianco.

However, the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the 'hood.   The Penne alla Vodka ($12.95) offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil cream and vodka.  It is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and that's exactly what the BF and I do every time we visit this place.  The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp sautéed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as it's the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well.

The bad news is that this place is no longer BYOB.  For whatever reason, the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than 20 needed a full liquor license.  I really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesn't lead to the undoing of this place.  Given that they don't even have a bar area and I almost never see anyone order a mixed drink, I think staying BYOB might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint.

The service at this place is also part of the show.  The waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit.  The décor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall.  If you happen to need a trip to the restroom, you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen.

All in all, Pizza A Metro is ironically a great option for everything but pizza.",1
"If I could there would be two reviews here. The golf course its self would be an easy 4 star based on price and condition. Customer service would be a 1 star. 

Don't bother trying to be friendly with the pro shop staff, these folks are just going to through the motions of taking your money and doing the least possible to get their paycheck. But since the golf is such a great value and people will continue to flock to this place in droves I don't see them needing to hire people with personalities any time in the near future. 

The front 9 cart girl is friendly as is the lady working the snack shack on the back. 

Another thing that didn't impress me was being a walk on, renting a cart and being told that they already had 2 carts in that group. I am used to being able to have my own cart instead of riding with a person I don' t know and being subjected to their cart skills or lack there of. Turned out okay but just struck me as odd. 

I will continue to go back for the great value but I hate to reward bad behavior.",0
"My wife and I as well as several of our friends drive from Ahwatukee on a regular basis to dine at Flo's on Thompson Peak and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. 25 miles isn't too far for this food. We've been eating here since the 90's and have always been pleased. I discovered it when I worked in the area and used to stand in line for lunch, it was so busy. Our favorites: Lemon Pepper Chicken with extra lemon wedges and the Kung Pow although I can't think of anything I wouldn't order.",1
"When I called to place an order last night I was put on hold briefly, however, this time my call was actually answered!!!!  When I walked in, the one girl at the desk seemed somewhat awake!!!  Keep up the good work Cantina Laredo!

"Went here for fathers day with my girlfriends parents because they gave a free entree for dad. He choose the fish and chips which looked amazing, I had fish tacos, my girlfirend had the steak and her mom got a salad. Everyhting was good. The service was great and the beers were decent. It was everything I could expect from a chain and thensome. I might even go back.",0
"This feels like a neighborhood bistro (much like the ones I have visited in New York).  The food is wonderful and the wine selection varies which I like.  My favorite dishes include:  Salmon, crab crepe, burger and ahi tartar -- but their menu changes often, so don't be surprised if you eat something you like and it's not there next time.",1
"Food was alright, nothing special, a bit bland. The water tasted so bad though, bad enough that you could still taste it through iced tea or tap water, do they not have a filter!?",0
"We'd heard that this place was really tasty, but learned that the original location had shut down recently.  We found their second location and gave it a try.

It ended up being so good that we went twice in one week while visiting the area. We had a chicken quesadilla both times and on one trip added a large nachos with chicken.  Great flavor, good-sized portions, good value.

Would have been a 5-star rating had our server not forgotten our drinks and had the restaurant been cleaner during our first visit.  We were directed to sit anywhere we liked, but it took us a while to find a clean table even though there were only two other tables occupied.",1
"Stopped in for the first time at PV Burger Company tonight.  It was quiet, only one table when I got there around 6:20pm.  Ordered a bacon havarti burger with fries and a coke; it came out to just over 9 bucks.  

The burger came with lettuce, tomato, cucumber (???), pickled red onions, and thousand island.  It was DELICIOUS.  Beautifully toasted bun, great char on the meat.  The pickled onions were a nice touch.  The fries were skinny and crispy and had seasoned salt, which brings me back to being a kid and getting fries at the food court in the mall (good memories).  I got a refill on my coke before I left, so I don't know what another reviewer was talking about when they said there are no refills on sodas.  I asked and it was no problem.

My only gripe is that after I had ordered and sat down to wait for my food, a couple of guys came in and the guy at the counter immediately handed them paper menus (with actual descriptions of the menu items I'm sure, unlike the chalkboard on the wall), which I would have liked.  I probably would have gotten an add-on for my burger if he had given me a paper menu when I was at the counter.  Oh well, now I know for next time, because there will definitely be a next time in the near future :)",1
"Good drinks, great food, and cool music. There is a stage right behind the bar. We tried the Fingerling Potatoes in Tomato Jam and it was fantastic.. I recommend.",1
"The best !

From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  ..i have been lovin' this place.
I also love the number 13 combo platter (.Mini beef chimi's ,Gauc ,rice and beans) 

The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum ! ... AND reasonably priced.",1
"Ii am addicted.  spectacular service and consistent, quality. food every time. i have been ordering take out and dine in for months and grimaldis does not disappoint.  only once...they gave my takeout pizza to the wrong person....christine, the manager, very generously apologized, comped my new pizza, and bought me a glass of wine as i waited.  grimaldis is a class act and has a fantastic staff with excellent food.  every time.",1
"Made the mistake of eating here on 10/24. Hostess and maitre de set the tone wrong with their completely haughty and unwelcoming approach when we arrived. Acted like they were doing us a big favor by letting us eat there. 

Wine list is extensive but outrageously overpriced. We selected a good bottle (90 points WS) and when we asked the self-labeled ""wine guy"" about it, he said, ""I actually can drink that."" A snobby comment. 

Food was completely uninspired and pedestrian. Nothing special here. 

Service fair, pace was bad between courses - long waits. 

Had a meal the night before at T Cooks -it was extremely better in every single category. Lon's gets by on it's nice patio setting. The food is average at best. Go to T Cooks instead.

If you do go here, call long ahead and at least get a decent table on the patio.",0
"Went with a party of 10 this past weekend for my best friend's birthday extravaganza. We had teppanyaki and our chef was terrific. He was very funny, inviting, and did a great job with everyone's food. We had a range of dishes from seafood to chicken to very well done steak and our chef handled it all with his silly little giggle. 

The happy hour prices can't be beat, but man once you get out of happy hour, the drink prices are STEEP! We had drinks, appetizers, sushi, and then teppanyaki. The calamari was chewy, but the bbq chicken egg rolls are great.  The drinks were yummy. I have no idea what kind of sushi we had, but it was pretty darn tasty too. 

The only reason this isn't a five star review is that our server had the personality of a rock. If he cracked a smile, it might have killed him. We spent collectively close to $500 and I don't think he could have cared any less about us. Too bad too because it reflected in his tip and generally we are pretty generous tippers. 

We'll go back to Sapporo in a heartbeat though. The people watching is tremendous!",1
"Good service. Excellent value. I went for the ""All You Can Eat"" deal they have from 2-9 PM and was there for a few hours. I'm not fat or anything, I just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit. The server was pretty attentive and the kitchen staff was pretty fast. I was kind of disappointed that the menu for the all you can eat deal was missing many of my favorites from the regular menu, but there were still quite a few good choices.",1
"Service, awesome.  Food, spectacular.  Price, unbeatable. 

I can't tell you how many times this restaurant has saved my life.  Richard is very understanding when I come in completely hung over, and knows to put extra kimchi in my side dishes.  

Also, in terms of the local ""$20 all you can eat"" sushi specials, this is the only place that ever pops into my head as  a place I need to go.  Their sushi chef if spectacular and super friendly so it's always a nice time sitting at the bar.

They have a special lunch menu that is served only during the week, so you can expect the dinner menu on Saturday and Sunday regardless of the time you go.  Both menus are amazing, it's just that the menus are slightly different in their options so if you have a specific craving (and I often do) you might have to concede to something different once you get there.  It's mildly annoying, but the food never disappoints so I let it go.

Try it, you wont be disappointed.",1
"I'd have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite (Fez, Ticoz, Switch), Ticoz is my favorite because of its dimly-lit lounge-like quality, which provides it a cozier feel than the other two.  Add to that, the hypnotic Mojito creations and Ticoz is one of those places I could spend an entire weekend late afternoon at, as long as someone else drives, of course.

The tamales are fantastic and are more similar to corn pudding than to traditional hand rolled tamales.  If you get them with veggies, you'll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish, so I recommend some other topping.  The beef is fantastic (especially in the tacos).

All in all, this is one of my current favorites.",1
Our first visit. A bit quiet on a Monday night. Service was fast and friendly. Wife and I shared a hommus appetizer and Greek fries. We like our hommus with more zest i.e. garlic. Main courses were the gyro dinner and chicken souvlaki meal. Both were tasty with generous portions. We'll go back.,1
"I started going to Sushi Eye since it opened. I quickly befriended Paul and Richard Cho who are the owners of the establishment. A more genuine and convivial Father-Son team of restaurateurs have never opened an establishment in Arizona.

Koreans (by ethnic group)  are by far the largest sushi bar operators in the USA and very successful at creating American pleasing establishments. The Cho clan left Northern California to come to the Valley for sun, golf and open sushi bars. They succeeded at all three. Loud House music, Sports Center on ESPN and lots of Shochu,  can accompany your fresh escolar sashimi and ASU roll. If your sushi'd out try the Nippon-Hawaiian fave, Chicken Katsu. A warm, ""Irasshaimase"" awaits all who enter this charming dollhouse sushi bar. 

By the way, I drank so much Shochu at Sushi Eye that I took a little nap on the gravel out in front of the establishment until Richard Cho came and rescued me from passing out in the gravel. A sushi chef and a finer wingman never existed in Chandler",1
"I just stopped at Biagio nail place today and got my mani and pedi done, it was fabulous. Tiffany gave me great feet and my neck massage. She does really job. The shellac manicure was really nice she gave me a lots of different colors so she actually helped me find the colors that i like and I was very happy that I got her. I will Go back and ask for her...",1
"I'm torn.


I LOVED my $20 facial. I'll probably go back for more once Groupon and the like run out of deals.

However, I also got a brow and eyelas tinting.  I wouldn't recommend that service from here.  My brows were uneven, and my lashes faded out quicker than normal.",0
"I had to drop it down to 2 stars.  The food was the same quality, but they do not bring out big bowls of white and brown rice anymore.  They brought out 5 small bowls of rice when there are 7 of us.  Are we suppose to share or have our individual bowls?  

We had our usuals:
2 chicken fried rice - ok
2 mongolian beef - good
2 chicken chow mein - good
2 crispy honey chicken - good
1 orange peel chicken - meh...
1 spicy chicken - too spicy for me, but the group said it was good

Main reason for the 2 stars was the service SUCKED!  We had to literally get our servers attention for anything (refills, more rice, togo boxes, etc.).  We waited 15 mins for our server to pick up the check, he never showed!  So we handed it off to other server and asked if she can help us.  He came back to the table only the times we can grab he attention.  We were always out of drinks.  I have not had that BAD of a service in a long time.  I will not come back on my own, but if the family wants to then they can drag me along (kicking and screaming).",0
"Downright awesome and extremely hip. A non-traditional, very out there, but very hidden coffee joint.

You can't see this place from the street. It's kind of behind the Buffalo Exchange. It's almost the last place you would expect to find a coffee shop. As soon as you walk in there are really bright and vivid paintings, this is kind of what makes it way out there. Barista was very friendly and asked us how the weather was, always cool to have some small talk instead of the drone, ""what can i get for you..."" Wait, that basically sounds like the boring coffee-grinders at Starbucks.

I gotta have my lattes. I will drink regular coffee sometimes, but my soft spot is a well made latte. Amazing enough, places like Starbucks just don't know how to make lattes, I give up on Starbucks. Their beans suck, and apparently their frothing machines do too, because everytime I go there it seems like they just warm my milk and mix it with some coffee. The latte here was PERFECT. The milk was perfectly frothy, which in my opinion is what makes a latte a latte. Coffee had a nice roasted flavor to it. Amazingly, there are tons of coffee shops out there that can't do decent lattes. This is my new coffee place.

Good music choice here, its like new age elevator music, calm soothing hip hop and pop. Awesome atmosphere, quiet enough to study and have a conversation, yet lively enough to come for just a cup of caffeine. Skip the Starbucks and ""Sex in the City"" sorority girl drinks and come here.

Only problem was that I think they only have small or large lattes, and it was like $4 for a large. That's like $0.50 to a $1 too much in my honest opinion. Oh well, I think I'd still pay that when I'm craving a latte.",1
"Truly the best pizza I've had so far in AZ. Reminded me of NY pizza, thin crust... and crusty! I could eat this crust alone it's so good!..  
In fact I did!!! Ate it with a little olive oil and it was yuyuyummy! Also had the antipasti, so glad they actually give you REAL antipasti and not a mesh of crazy salad... you have to try this place if you haven't already.  My husband and I got a small pizza and had enough to take home for leftovers... and we are BIG eaters! RICO!!!",1
